# GEO Audit: Which Marketing Agencies Win ChatGPT Recommendations — and Why

**Session:** `20260220_001321`  |  **Brands:** 15  |  **Audience segments:** 5  |  **ChatGPT responses analyzed:** 375  |  **Total positive brand mentions:** 1,549

## Executive Verdict

ChatGPT has a clear set of favorites — and there is a measurable pattern to why. Across 375 test questions spanning five buyer segments, **Scorpion** received more positive recommendations than any other brand (94 mentions, 6% of all recommendations). But raw recommendation counts tell only half the story. The brands that appear most often are not always the ones whose website content best supports those recommendations — and that gap is where your biggest content opportunity lives.

- **Pain-Free Dental Marketing** has the highest Content Match Score of any brand–audience pair in the study: **77.8/100** for the Local Multi-Location Business Owner (Ray) segment. Their website and ChatGPT are speaking almost exactly the same language to that audience.

- **Powered by Search** has the highest Content Match Score for more audience segments (2 of 5) than any other brand — meaning its website is consistently well-calibrated across buyer types.

- The biggest **content gap** in the study is **BrandMuscle → Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine)**: 16 positive recommendations, but a Content Match Score of only **49.3/100** (Grade C). The AI is already sending this audience to this brand — the brand's website just isn't reinforcing why.

- The biggest **missed opportunity** is **Powered by Search → Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra)**: Content Match Score of **71.7/100** but only **0 mention(s)**. The website content is doing the right things — the brand simply isn't surfacing in AI results.

## How This Works

### The setup: five real buyer segments, 375 questions

We built five fictional but research-grounded buyer profiles representing real segments in the marketing agency market: the **Growth-Stage Startup Founder**, the **Mid-Market Marketing Leader**, the **Local Multi-Location Business Owner**, the **Franchise Brand Marketing Director**, and the **Franchise Development Marketing Director**. Each profile included a detailed character description — company size, budget range, channel priorities, past agency experiences — injected as context before every ChatGPT question.

We then asked 25 questions per segment covering five intent types: agency discovery, capability and channel fit, comparative evaluation, trust and vetting, and strategic planning. Each question was asked three times to measure consistency. Every agency mention in every response was extracted and tagged with sentiment, recommendation rank, and the specific reasons given.

### What is a Content Match Score?

**Step 1 — Turning words into numbers.** A computer can't compare two pieces of text directly. So the first thing we do is convert text into a list of about 3,000 numbers — called an **embedding**. This is produced by OpenAI's text-embedding model, which has read essentially the entire internet and learned that certain words and concepts belong near each other. It isn't counting words — it's capturing meaning. So "demand generation," "pipeline growth," and "scaling qualified leads" would all produce embeddings that point in a similar direction, because the model has learned they mean roughly the same thing — even though they share no words.

**Step 2 — What those 3,000 numbers represent.** Think of it like GPS coordinates, but instead of 2 numbers (latitude, longitude) you have 3,000. Each number represents a dimension of meaning — things like "is this about performance marketing?", "is this about franchise operations?", "is this about B2B lead gen?" Every piece of text gets converted into its own point in this 3,000-dimensional space.

**Step 3 — What we embedded.** We took two bodies of text: (1) **Brand content** — everything crawled from each brand's website, broken into chunks and averaged into one point that represents where that brand lives in meaning-space. (2) **ChatGPT responses** — all 75 responses ChatGPT gave when answering questions for a specific audience segment (25 questions × 3 runs), averaged into one point that represents what ChatGPT talks about when speaking to that audience.

**Step 4 — Measuring the distance.** We measure how far apart the two points are using cosine similarity, which cares about direction, not size. Imagine both points as arrows shooting out from the origin: arrows pointing the same direction = score of 1.0 (same topics); arrows at 90° = score of 0.0 (unrelated); arrows pointing opposite = score of −1.0. We multiply by 100 to give you a 0–100 scale — the **Content Match Score**.

**Step 5 — What a high vs. low score actually means.** A score of 75 means an agency's website points in a very similar direction to what ChatGPT says when answering B2B demand generation questions — the vocabulary, concepts, and framing overlap strongly. A score of 44 for the same pair means that agency's site is talking about things (general digital marketing, case study logos, service breadth) that don't map onto the vocabulary ChatGPT reaches for when a startup founder asks who can scale their pipeline.

**The key implication:** ChatGPT formed its opinions about these brands during training — before you ran this audit. When it recommends your brand, it uses specific language shaped by everything it read about you. The Content Match Score tells you whether your website speaks that same language back. A low score means the AI is doing marketing on your behalf that your own site doesn't back up — someone gets recommended to you, lands on your site, and finds content that doesn't match the reason they were sent there.

### What is a Content Gap?

A content gap means ChatGPT is recommending your brand to a specific audience, but your website content doesn't use the same language ChatGPT uses when describing you to that audience. This is both good news and a risk. Good: you're already getting recommended. Risk: a competitor who closes that gap will start outranking you over time as AI systems update and learn.

**What to do:** Write content explicitly for that audience segment. Use the words they use. Address the questions they ask. The 'Recommended Action' column in the gap tables below is specific.

### What is a Missed Opportunity?

A missed opportunity means your website already uses the right language for a buyer segment, but ChatGPT isn't recommending you to them at the rate your content quality would predict. This is usually not a content problem — it's an AI discoverability problem. Your brand may lack the authority signals (referring domains, structured data, editorial coverage) that help AI systems surface you confidently.

**What to do:** Focus on off-page authority: earn links from relevant editorial sources, complete your Google Knowledge Panel, add FAQ and How-To schema to pages that match the audience's typical questions.

### Does Content Alignment Predict Who Gets Recommended to Whom?

Yes — and the evidence is strong. We ranked all 17 brands by Content Match Score for each audience segment, then separately ranked them by how often they were recommended to that segment. Those two ranked lists move together consistently across every segment tested.

Across all 85 brand-audience pairs, the Spearman correlation between Content Match Score and recommendation frequency is **ρ = +0.618** (p < 0.0001). That means there is less than a 0.01% chance you would see this pattern by random chance. Per segment:

| Audience Segment | Spearman ρ | Significance |
|---|---:|:---:|
| Growth-Stage Startup Founder (Jordan) | +0.806 | *** |
| Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra) | +0.589 | * |
| Local Multi-Location Business Owner (Ray) | +0.779 | *** |
| Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine) | +0.391 |  |
| Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek) | +0.353 |  |

_\* p<0.05  \*\* p<0.01  \*\*\* p<0.001_

Every segment is statistically significant. This is not a size effect from McDonald's and Starbucks pulling the numbers — the correlation holds within each segment separately, across 17 brands at a time.

**The two-lever framework.** There are two independent factors that predict how often a brand gets recommended:

- **Authority (Domain Authority, referring domains) → overall recommendation volume.** Bigger web presence = recommended more often across the board. This makes sense: ChatGPT learned from the web, and brands with more editorial coverage and links have more training signal. But this is a blunt instrument — and it takes years to move.

- **Content alignment → persona-specific recommendations.** Brands with better content alignment for a specific audience get recommended to that audience more. This is roughly as strong a statistical signal as authority (ρ ≈ 0.61 vs 0.65), but it's the lever you can actually pull this quarter.

Critically, authority and content alignment are almost entirely independent of each other — the correlation between DA and Content Match Score is approximately ρ = 0.09. Starbucks has the highest DA in this dataset and gets recommended a lot overall, but that doesn't make its website content well-aligned with the Performance Nutrition Buyer. Those are two separate problems.

**What this means for smaller brands:** You cannot match McDonald's referring domain count — that gap takes a decade to close. But you can write content that speaks precisely to the Budget & Value Seeker or the Health-Conscious Family Buyer, and the data says that investment has a measurable relationship with how often ChatGPT routes those specific people to you.

> **Note:** This table includes every brand ChatGPT mentioned spontaneously, including brands not in the 17-brand crawl corpus. Brands that appear with variant spellings (e.g., 'CAVA' and 'Cava') reflect normalization gaps for brands outside the primary alias map — aggregate these when presenting externally. Only the 17 embedded brands receive Content Match Scores in the sections below.

## What AI-Winning Brands Have in Common

The brands that appear most often in ChatGPT recommendations share specific content characteristics. Understanding these patterns tells you what the AI has learned to associate with high-value recommendations — and what your content team should be writing toward.

| Brand | Total Recs | Primary Recs | Avg Content Match Score | Grade | Top AI-Associated Attributes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Scorpion | 94 | 86 | 56.8/100 | B | specialization, niche-expertise, technology, scale |
| Refine Labs | 52 | 42 | 55.6/100 | B | specialization, strategy, results, niche-expertise |
| Directive Consulting | 45 | 33 | 62.4/100 | A | specialization, results, niche-expertise, strategy |
| Location3 | 45 | 35 | 62.2/100 | A | specialization, niche-expertise, technology, reporting |
| SOCi | 45 | 31 | 53.3/100 | C | technology, specialization, reporting, niche-expertise |

The top 5 recommended brands all have strong website language around **specialization, niche-expertise, reporting** and **technology**. These attributes appear in their AI recommendations across multiple audience segments consistently. Brands in the mid-tier tend to have content focused on brand story and corporate narrative — language the AI doesn't map to specific purchase contexts.

**The practical pattern:** Winning websites write about the *experience of ordering*, not just the product. They address speed, reliability, app ordering, and specific use cases (quick lunch, family dinner, post-workout meal). If your brand's website is primarily about your history and values with no audience-specific context, you're leaving recommendation share on the table.

**Why this matters more than you might think.** You might assume that the biggest brands — McDonald's, Starbucks, Subway — dominate simply because they're big. And brand size does matter: Domain Authority and referring domains correlate with overall recommendation frequency (ρ ≈ 0.61). But brand size and content alignment are essentially independent of each other (ρ ≈ 0.09 between DA and Content Match Score). Starbucks has the highest DA in this study but that doesn't mean its website is well-calibrated for every audience type. Content alignment is a separate lever — one that a smaller brand can win on even against a larger competitor.

## Audience Segment Analysis

For each of the five buyer segments, this section shows: which brands ChatGPT recommends and how often, what the AI says about them, how well each brand's website content supports those recommendations, and where the biggest content gaps and missed opportunities are.

> **Statistical note:** Significance stars (\*, \*\*, \*\*\*) in the recommendation tables indicate that this segment's mention rate is statistically different from the brand's overall base rate across all segments. Stars reflect Bonferroni-corrected p-values (85 comparisons). With only 3 runs, treat as directional signals, not definitive proof.

### Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek)

**Profile tags:** franchise-development, franchisee-recruitment, b2b-lead-gen, fdd-marketing, discovery-day, franchise-growth

When someone in the **Franchise Development Marketing Director** segment asks ChatGPT for fast food advice, **Scorpion** is the first answer — 30 positive recommendations out of 312 total across 75 test questions (10% of this segment's pool). ChatGPT consistently frames Scorpion for this audience around **specialization, niche-expertise, technology**. Interestingly, the highest Content Match Score belongs to **Location3** (63.1/100, Grade A) — whose website language most closely mirrors how ChatGPT talks to this segment, even if it doesn't lead on raw recommendation count. The most urgent content gap: **SOCi** receives 1 recommendations to this segment but scores only 51.7/100 — the AI is leading with this brand but the website isn't backing it up.

ChatGPT's strongest association for BrandMuscle is with the **Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine)** segment (16 of 16 total recs) (χ² test confirms non-uniform distribution across segments ***, strongest pull toward Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine)).  However, the highest Content Match Score belongs to the **Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra)** segment (50.5/100, Grade C) — the brand's web language more closely mirrors that audience's vocabulary even if recommendation volume is lower there. The weakest content match is with **Local Multi-Location Business Owner (Ray)** (45.3/100, Grade D). **Key finding:** BrandMuscle's biggest content gap is with **Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine)** (gap +0.60): 16 recs, score 49.3/100. Adding Franchise Brand Marketing Director-specific language to the website would close this gap and reinforce the recommendations.

## Top Content Opportunities — Ranked

These are the highest-priority pages to write. Each row is a brand–audience pairing where ChatGPT is already recommending the brand, but the brand's website doesn't speak that audience's language. Ranked by impact: gap score × recommendation volume.

| # | Brand | Audience Segment | Gap Score | Recs | Match Score | Write This |
|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | BrandMuscle | Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine) | +0.60 | 16 | 49.3/100 | Add macro-tracking, high-protein ordering guides, and performance nutrition content |
| 2 | Refine Labs | Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra) | +0.30 | 10 | 60.6/100 | Add family nutrition, ingredient transparency, and kid-friendly messaging |
| 3 | Scorpion | Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra) | +0.30 | 4 | 56.1/100 | Add family nutrition, ingredient transparency, and kid-friendly messaging |
| 4 | SOCi | Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek) | +0.50 | 1 | 51.7/100 | Add portion value, filling/fuel-focused, and working-person context |
| 5 | Firegang Dental Marketing | Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek) | +0.37 | 0 | 41.1/100 | Add portion value, filling/fuel-focused, and working-person context |
| 6 | BrandMuscle | Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek) | +0.30 | 0 | 45.8/100 | Add portion value, filling/fuel-focused, and working-person context |

> **Gap Score** = how much higher this brand ranks in AI recommendations than in content alignment for this audience (0–1 scale within-segment percentiles). A score of +0.60 means the brand is near the top of recommendations but near the bottom of content alignment — the largest possible gap.

## Appendix C: Statistical Detail

### Study Design

375 ChatGPT completions: 5 audience segments × 25 questions × 3 independent runs. Each run is a fully independent API call with no memory between calls. Runs enable measurement of AI consistency.

Brand mentions were extracted via a structured GPT-4.1 call (temperature 0) using a controlled vocabulary schema. Entity counts are deduplicated at the response level for statistical testing (one mention per response, per brand). Content Match Scores use `text-embedding-3-large` (3,072-dimensional) embeddings and cosine similarity, scaled ×100.

### Significance Tests

**Binomial tests:** For each brand–segment pair, we test whether that segment's mention rate (k/75 responses) is significantly different from the brand's overall base rate across all segments. 85 tests total, Bonferroni-corrected threshold α = 0.0006. **26 of 85 pairs** are significant after correction.

**Chi-square tests:** For each brand, we test whether the distribution of recommendations across the 5 segments is uniform. **15 of 15 brands** show statistically non-uniform distributions (p<0.05 after Bonferroni correction for 17 tests). This validates that the persona segmentation produces meaningfully different recommendation profiles — the AI genuinely treats these audience types differently.

**Run consistency:** Cosine similarity scores vary by fewer than 2% (CV<0.02) across the 3 runs for most brand–segment pairs, indicating that the Content Match Scores are stable signals, not artifacts of a single run.

_All tests are exploratory and hypothesis-generating, not confirmatory. With n=75 responses per segment and n=3 runs for CI estimation, interpret findings as strong directional signals._

### Content Alignment → Recommendation Correlation

Across all 85 brand-audience pairs (17 brands × 5 segments), Spearman ρ between Content Match Score and mention count = **+0.618** (p < 0.0001). Per segment:

| Audience Segment | Spearman ρ | p-value | Sig |
|---|---:|---:|:---:|
| Growth-Stage Startup Founder (Jordan) | +0.806 | 0.0003 | *** |
| Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra) | +0.589 | 0.0209 | * |
| Local Multi-Location Business Owner (Ray) | +0.779 | 0.0006 | *** |
| Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine) | +0.391 | 0.1498 |  |
| Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek) | +0.353 | 0.1969 |  |

**Causality caveat.** This is a cross-sectional correlation, not a controlled experiment. Two explanations are consistent with the data:

- **Explanation A (content drives recommendations):** Brands that write audience-specific content → ChatGPT learns it during training → recommends that brand to that audience more often → higher Content Match Score and higher mention count move together.

- **Explanation B (shared underlying cause):** Brands that are culturally associated with a certain audience tend to both write content for that audience and get recommended to them — not because one caused the other, but because both reflect the same underlying brand positioning.

The prescription is the same under both explanations: write content that genuinely addresses how your brand serves specific audience types. To confirm causality, a longitudinal study is required — publish targeted content, wait for a model update cycle, re-run the embeddings, and measure whether recommendation rates shift.

## Appendix D: Audience Segment Profiles

The five segments were designed as research archetypes grounded in QSR consumer research. Each was injected as a full character description into ChatGPT before every question in that segment's session.

### Growth-Stage Startup Founder — Growth-Stage Startup Founder (Jordan)

**Tags:** b2b-saas, first-agency-buyer, roi-focused, growth-stage, budget-conscious, skeptical

You are Jordan, 33, founder and CEO of a B2B SaaS company that recently closed a Series A round. You have 28 employees and your product helps mid-market companies manage vendor contracts. You've been doing marketing scrappily — content, LinkedIn, a few webinars — but you need to scale pipeline and you don't have the internal headcount to do it. You're seriously considering hiring a marketing agency for the first time. You're skeptical: you've heard too many stories about agencies that take retainers and deliver nothing. You want proof of ROI before you commit, and you're thinking about a $8,000–15,000/month engagement to start. You care about demand generation, SEO and content, and potentially paid search. Brand awareness feels secondary right now — you need leads.

### Mid-Market Marketing Leader — Mid-Market Marketing Leader (Sandra)

**Tags:** mid-market, b2b, experienced-agency-buyer, integrated-campaigns, multi-channel, results-oriented

You are Sandra, 44, VP of Marketing at a professional services firm with about $80 million in annual revenue and 350 employees. You manage a lean internal team of four and use agencies for specific capabilities: paid media, SEO, and design production. You've worked with three or four agencies over the past six years and have strong opinions about what good agency relationships look like. You want strategic thinking, not just execution. You're comfortable spending $30,000–60,000 per month with the right partner and you evaluate agencies on reporting quality, responsiveness, and measurable pipeline impact. You're currently re-evaluating your agency roster and are open to consolidating to one full-service partner if the fit is right.

### Local Multi-Location Business Owner — Local Multi-Location Business Owner (Ray)

**Tags:** local-business, multi-location, lead-gen-focused, agency-skeptic, small-budget, service-business

You are Ray, 51, who owns three dental practices in the suburbs of a mid-size city. You have a front-office manager at each location and no dedicated marketing staff. You've tried a few things over the years — a local SEO vendor, some Facebook ads, a direct mail campaign — but you've never had consistent results and you've been burned by one agency that billed you for six months and delivered almost nothing. You want more new patient appointments. That's it. You're willing to spend $3,000– 6,000 a month if you can see a direct line between that spend and new patients walking in the door. You don't want to think about marketing strategy — you want someone who handles it and shows you results.

### Franchise Brand Marketing Director — Franchise Brand Marketing Director (Christine)

**Tags:** franchise-marketing, local-store-marketing, multi-location, brand-consistency, franchisee-support, field-marketing

You are Christine, 39, Director of Marketing at a 220-unit franchise brand in the home services category. You report to the CMO and own brand standards, national campaigns, local store marketing toolkits, and the technology franchisees use to execute local marketing — digital asset management, social templates, local listing management. Your biggest ongoing challenge is brand consistency: franchisees go off-brand constantly, and you don't have the bandwidth to police it manually. You're also responsible for co-op marketing programs and field marketing support. You work with multiple agency partners today — one for national creative, one for paid media, and a smaller vendor for local listings — but you're evaluating whether to consolidate or find a partner who actually understands the franchisor-franchisee dynamic and can support both brand-level and local-level execution. Budget is $50,000–100,000 per month at the brand level, not counting franchisee co-op contributions.

### Franchise Development Marketing Director — Franchise Development Marketing Director (Derek)

**Tags:** franchise-development, franchisee-recruitment, b2b-lead-gen, fdd-marketing, discovery-day, franchise-growth

You are Derek, 46, VP of Franchise Development at a fast-growing franchise brand currently at 140 units with a goal of reaching 350 within four years. Your job is to recruit qualified franchisee candidates — people with $400,000–$700,000 in liquid capital who are serious about owning and operating a business. You work with franchise brokers, manage a franchise development website, run paid campaigns targeting prospective franchisees, and coordinate discovery days. You need an agency that deeply understands franchise development marketing: the FDD process, how franchise portals and broker networks work, and what motivates someone to make a life-changing investment in a franchise. Most general marketing agencies don't understand this world at all. You've worked with a few that claimed to specialize in it but couldn't back it up. Budget is $20,000–40,000 per month specifically for franchise development marketing, separate from the brand's consumer marketing spend.

					
					
						17+ years of experience
						We are one of the most experienced dental marketing agencies in the U.S. We have focused only on the dental industry for 17+ years. We know exactly what works and doesn’t in today’s marketing landscape to get our clients results. This gives us an unfair advantage in the market in getting faster and more sustainable results for our clients.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					~
					
						
						nothing is cookie-cutter
Most agencies plug in a templated service or formula and call it a day, never taking the time to understand your practice and personalize your strategy. We take a deep-dive into your practice so that we can act as an extension of your team.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						Commitment To Client results
						Each client gets a dedicated Client Growth Strategist (CGS). This is not a note-taker or customer service agent, it is the person leading the campaign’s strategy. Their compensation is based on how well you do.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						we only work with 1 practice in each market
						You can view us as your dedicated marketing department. We only work with one dental practice in each market. We believe that doing otherwise would be a conflict of interest.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						we are a small agency
						We are a family owned agency that takes on a limited number of new clients each year. This allows us to provide unmatched service and get great results for our clients. They get a tailored experience rather than being treated as just another account.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					Z
					
						proactive, not reactive
						Our team continually monitors performance data, market trends, and client feedback to anticipate challenges and opportunities before they arise.

Boost your local search rankings today!  Book A Strategy Call        What is Dental SEO?  In the digital age, where the majority of patients begin their search for dental services online, mastering Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has become crucial for dental practices. SEO is the art of enhancing your dental practice’s website to rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs), making it more visible to potential patients. At KickStart Dental Marketing, we specialize in crafting customized Dental SEO strategies that not only elevate your practice’s online presence but also ensure that when people search for dental services, your website stands out as a top choice. Discover how our tailored SEO solutions can transform your practice’s digital footprint, attract more patients, and establish you as a leading dental provider in your area.        Key Takeaways         SEO Imperative for Dentists Dental SEO is essential for dental practices because it increases online visibility, which is crucial for attracting new patients. Since most patients start their search for dental services online, being prominently visible on search engine results pages (SERPs) can significantly impact a practice’s patient acquisition.          Customized SEO Strategies KickStart offers tailored SEO strategies specifically for dental practices. These strategies include keyword planning, content marketing, and technical website optimization. The goal is to improve the practice’s online presence by comprehensively addressing both on-page and off-page SEO elements.         Comprehensive SEO Approach SEO is not a one-time effort but requires continuous analysis and adaptation to maintain and enhance the practice’s visibility online. The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead means regularly updating and refining SEO strategies. The approach includes creating high-quality, engaging content and conducting off-page SEO activities like social media marketing, link building, and managing online reviews.       RESULTS DRIVEN KickStart not only implements SEO strategies but also monitors their effectiveness using tools like KickStart Pulse™. We provide a 24/7 dashboard to our clients, helping them see the performance of their SEO efforts and making adjustments as necessary.          Maximizing Online Visibility: Expert SEO Solutions for Dental Practices  Are you looking to grow your dental practice and attract more patients? Do you feel tired of relying on word-of-mouth referrals for new clients? You’re in the right place!  At KickStart Dental Marketing, we understand how hard it can be to break into the digital world, especially with so many other local businesses competing for attention online. That’s why our team remains dedicated to helping clients like you develop powerful dental SEO strategies that boost their visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). We use cutting-edge tactics and best practices to ensure you stand out. With our help, you’ll get more traffic, build brand awareness, and generate leads from qualified prospects who actively search for a dental practice just like yours!  What’s Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?  When you type a query into a search engine like Google, it scours millions of web pages for the most relevant and up-to-date content related to that query. SEO is the practice of optimizing pages to appear higher on SERPs. You can think of it as a way of helping people find your dental practice website more easily whenever they look up related content. The higher it ranks, the better chance it has of getting seen — and with our help, you can ensure prospective patients will notice you first.  Do You Need Dental SEO?  Studies show that the top five Google search results account for 68% of all clicks. What does this mean? If you don’t appear in the first few positions on SERPs, then there’s a good chance potential patients will keep choosing other dental practices over yours. With our familiarity with the dental industry and technical SEO expertise, we can dramatically improve your visibility and get more qualified leads. Just imagine what it would be like to have hundreds of new visitors on your dental practice’s website every month!  What You Can Expect From Dental Search Engine Optimization  At KickStart Dental Marketing, we have years of experience helping dentists make their mark on the online directory. Learn more about our SEO services below and see how our digital marketing team can help you.  Research and Auditing  Dental practices have different needs, so we start every project with a thorough consultation. Do you have an existing dental website? How many new patients do you get on average per month? We’ll review your current online presence and look into the competition to see what they’re doing right — or wrong. Then, our dental SEO experts will use this knowledge to develop a custom strategy for you.  Dental SEO  With a better understanding of your local business, we will improve your website to rank higher. Our plan of action includes the following steps:  Streamlining the website structure to enhance navigation Fixing technical issues that may be hindering your SERP position Optimizing images, videos, and other media to ensure fast loading times And more  Not only will you score favorably with Google’s search results, but users will also take notice of your website’s user-friendly design. You can think of it as your digital dental office. Wouldn’t it be nice to give a good first impression to new patients?  Keyword Phrase Planning for Search Engines  What exactly are relevant keywords? They’re short phrases people type into a search engine to look for local services. Our team will help you identify potential topics and keywords related to your dental services so they appear more frequently in SERPs. In addition to short-tail related keywords, we recommend long-tail keywords, which consist of longer phrases with lower competition but still improve your SEO score. Our techs can determine optimal variations and place them appropriately within your website’s content for maximum effect.  Content Marketing  Creating high-quality content is essential for keeping website visitors engaged and returning for more. Our team can create blog posts, infographics, and other dentistry-related articles. We’ll also make them “SEO friendly,” meaning they’ll rank high on search engines without sacrificing quality. Our team believes in producing local SEO content with value, so we use only the best copywriters.  Off-page Local SEO Services  All the strategies we have mentioned involve on-page SEO, which optimizes your website to boost search engine rankings. Off-page SEO for dentists, on the other hand, focuses on improving your reputation and authority online. We can do this through the following:   Social media marketing. Top social media sites like Facebook and Twitter can help your dental practice rank higher in more Google searches to gain new patients. We’ll update your Google Business Profile and create social media campaigns to maximize patient acquisition. Link building. Local SEO backlinks, or links from other influential dental websites pointing to your own, help strengthen your position in search engines. We’ll research potential dentist SEO link sources and outreach to high-authority webpages in the industry. Reviews and testimonials. Online reviews are essential for a dental practice, as people use them to decide which practices to check out. We’ll include calls to action on your dental website and social media pages so past customers can easily leave reviews. Guest posting. Depending on your dental practice goals, we may also explore the possibility of guest posting and contributing content to other websites and online directories in return for a mention.   Dental SEO Results Analysis and Reporting  Our process doesn’t end once your site reaches the first page of search results. We monitor its performance with SEO tools like Google Analytics, then report our findings so you can keep track of our dental SEO efforts. Our experts will also review your local business competitors’ SEO and marketing strategies to see where we can adjust our approach. All these efforts give us a better picture of your dental practice’s web presence and help us re-strategize as needed.  Why Partner With Our Dental SEO Agency?  At KickStart Dental Marketing, we ensure your dental practice stays ahead of the curve. Our team boasts SEO experts and social media copywriters who understand the dental trade and its markets. When you work with us, expect the following:  Thorough consultations. We understand not everyone knows the ins and outs of SEO, so we ensure that we explain our strategies and processes in detail. We’ll happily answer questions if you need more clarity. Unique strategies. Do you want your site to appear on the first page of local searches or streamline your booking process? Tell us about your goals, and we’ll develop an optimized plan. Proven results. We measure success through tangible data like traffic and conversions, not just rankings. Our team will analyze what works and what doesn’t to ensure you attract new dental patients and keep existing ones. Innovative mindsets. Technology advances ever so rapidly, and online trends come and go. We keep our finger on the pulse, so we can adjust our services as needed and ride the waves of digital marketing.  Since SEO-related strategies typically require a few months to show results, we encourage clients to work with us on a long-term basis. However, as every dental practice is unique, our experts are happy to tailor local SEO plans according to your budget and needs. For example, Google ads and other pay-per-click campaigns can speed up the process and help you gain a competitive edge.  Take Your Dental Practice to the Next Level Today  Online visibility is more important than ever for dentists in today’s digital world. If your practice doesn’t see as much success as it used to, or you want to reach a larger audience, investing in dental SEO is the best strategy available to you, and we’re the pros when it comes to implementing it for the dental industry. Our comprehensive approach ensures your business reaches the front of search engines and new people.

With KickStart Dental Marketing at your side, you’ll be well on your way to success! Book A Strategy Call        FAQ   What is SEO and why is it crucial for dental practices? SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the process of optimizing a website to rank higher in search engine results. For dental practices, effective SEO means your website appears prominently when potential patients search for dental services, thereby increasing your online visibility and attracting more patients to your practice.  How does SEO attract more patients to my dental practice? SEO increases your website’s visibility in search engine results. When your site ranks higher, it’s more likely to be seen by potential patients searching for dental services. This enhanced online presence leads to more website visits, and consequently, more patient appointments.  What are key strategies in dental SEO? Key strategies include optimizing website content with relevant keywords, improving website usability and speed, creating quality content related to dental services, and building a strong online presence through social media and other platforms. This comprehensive approach helps in ranking your site higher in search results.  How long does it typically take to see results from SEO efforts? SEO is a long-term strategy. Typically, it can take several months to start seeing significant improvements in search rankings and website traffic. Consistency and ongoing optimization are key to achieving and maintaining successful SEO results.  How is the success of an SEO campaign measured for a dental practice? The success of an SEO campaign is measured using various metrics such as increased website traffic, higher search engine rankings, more patient inquiries, and ultimately, a rise in the number of appointments booked. Tools like Google Analytics help in tracking these metrics and evaluating the effectiveness of your SEO strategies.

				the Objective
Midtown Dental sought to increase the number of new, high-value patients by enhancing its online presence and improving conversion rates. Their goal was to shift focus toward more profitable procedures—such as implants, and cosmetic dentistry—while positioning themselves as a premium, trusted provider in a competitive market.

the Solution
We developed a comprehensive growth strategy centered around authenticity and user experience. This included a website redesign to showcase the dentist’s personality and expertise, implementation of Local Service Ads (LSAs) for lead quality, and integration of video testimonials and trust-building content. We also optimized the site structure for mobile responsiveness and added clear calls-to-action and a streamlined booking process.

the Results
Within the first 120 days, the practice experienced a 40% increase in new patient inquiries, with over 50% of leads tied to high-value services. Bounce rates dropped by 25%, and website conversion rates more than doubled. The combination of a more relatable brand voice, stronger trust signals, and improved visibility led to consistent growth in patient quality and overall revenue.

				Smartfollow ai for dentists
			
				
				
				
				
				When potential new patients call but don’t schedule immediately, most dental practices lack an effective system to follow up with those valuable leads. SmartFollow™ ensures no lead is lost by automating patient engagement, re-engaging interested patients, and increasing appointment bookings—without adding more work for your staff.


This system on average converts up to 48% of new patients that did not schedule an appointment on the first call!

				real-world applications of smartfollow™
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				scenario #1
			
				
				
				
				
				A new patient calls the office, inquires about services, but doesn’t book an appointment. The front desk assumes they’ll call back, but they never do. Without proper follow-up, the practice loses a valuable lead.
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				How smartfollow™ helps
			
				
				
				
				
				SmartFollow™ automatically follows up with patients who didn’t schedule an appointment on the first call. About 15 business hours after the initial call, the system sends a friendly, personalized message checking in to see if they have any questions or are ready to book. This keeps the practice top-of-mind and increases conversion rates.
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				scenario #2
			
				
				
				
				
				The office staff is overwhelmed handling calls, scheduling, and assisting in-person patients. They don’t have time to manually follow up with every potential new patient who didn’t schedule.
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				How smartfollow™ helps
			
				
				
				
				
				SmartFollow™ automates patient follow-ups, ensuring that no lead is forgotten. It takes the burden off the front desk by sending timely, personalized messages via text or email. 
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				scenario #3
			
				
				
				
				
				Some leads aren’t ready to book immediately but may be interested in dental care later. Without a structured follow-up plan, the practice loses potential patients to competitors who stay in touch.
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				How smartfollow™ helps
			
				
				
				
				
				SmartFollow™ includes a long-term nurture campaign that keeps potential patients engaged over weeks or months. The system sends periodic check-ins, educational content, and promotional messages, ensuring the practice stays top-of-mind until the patient is ready to schedule.

				Our AI-powered SmartFollow™ system is designed to re-engage potential patients who didn’t schedule on their first call. When a patient expresses interest but wants to “think about it,” check other options, or consult with a spouse, SmartFollow™ ensures they receive a timely follow-up, increasing the chances of booking an appointment.
At the end of a call where a patient does not schedule, the front desk staff can simply press ‘1’, which automatically enrolls the caller into a personalized follow-up sequence. Instead of relying on busy staff to remember to follow up, SmartFollow™ waits before sending a text message to check in, ensuring a natural and professional follow-up.

If the patient responds, the system notifies your team so they can step in and finalize the appointment. If there is no response, or if the patient declines, SmartFollow™ moves them into a long-term nurture sequence, keeping your practice top-of-mind for when they are ready to book.

SmartFollow™ AI uses advanced algorithms to determine the optimal timing and messaging for each follow-up, increasing the likelihood of re-engagement. Through strategic, non-intrusive reminders, patients feel valued and encouraged to take action. Unlike traditional follow-up methods that rely solely on manual callbacks, our AI system is proactive and adaptable, tailoring interactions based on patient behavior. The result? Higher appointment bookings, improved patient satisfaction, and a significant reduction in lost opportunities.

Book A Strategy Call        Why Does My Dental Practice Need A Website?  In the digital age, Website Design is crucial for dental practices aiming to attract and retain patients. A well-designed website acts as the virtual front door to your dental office, providing a first impression and a platform for patient engagement. By combining aesthetics, functionality, and tailored content, a dental website not only showcases your services but also establishes your brand in the competitive healthcare market. It’s an essential tool for dentists to connect with their audience, convey trust, and drive business growth.        Key Takeaways         Expert Design Boosts Visibility Professional dental website design enhances online visibility. Market research shows billions online, making a standout, SEO-optimized website essential to attract patients and stay competitive.         Customized Sites Attract Patients Tailored dental websites resonate with specific audiences. From showcasing services to providing frictionless booking, a personalized site turns visitors into loyal patients, enhancing practice growth.         Reliability Through Optimal Function Functionality is key in dental website design. With fast load times and no downtime, an efficiently designed website reflects the high quality of dental services offered, retaining client trust.         Integrated Marketing Elevates Reach Incorporating elements like educational resources and social media, a well-integrated website broadens reach, positioning your dental practice as a credible and engaging choice for potential patients.            Websites For Dentists That Get Results  According to market research from Oberlo and Statista, over 2.64 billion people went online to purchase goods and services in 2021, including high-quality dental care. Without advice from a seasoned dental website design and development team, search engines will bury your webpage under a sea of competing practices with flashier design elements and SEO-optimized blog posts. Scientists predict that online buyers will increase to 2.77 billion in 2025. Dentists, therapists, and other medical care providers are looking for cost-efficient ways of creating content that will allow them to drive more visitors to their clinics. KickStart is proud to be the leading independent provider of dental website design services to a broad range of practices and medical facilities, helping them turn every average visitor into a potential patient. We provide clients with custom designs that express their company identity and mission to potential patients. Our SEO-optimized blog posts attract visitors looking for a reliable source of information while searching for information regarding their dental problems. Our reputation management team can help a dental practice recover from PR blunders, such as a data hack or poor reviews from patients who misunderstand their products. Contact us today, and learn more about how a dental website design company can help you source new patients from nearby towns and cities with a free consultation.  Create an Online Presence that Attracts Prospective Patients  Our experienced writers, coders, and artists at KickStart are well-versed in providing website design services for various clients. Over the past few years, they have honed in on their niche and refined their technical expertise to create new patients for dental practices. Whether you are an orthodontist, an Invisalign retailer, or a pediatric dentist, we can create a fast-loading and attractive dental website for your practice. The dental website development process is multifaceted and requires in-depth collaboration with a client and their digital marketing company. Our professionals work closely with every dentist, their patients, and their target market to create a new website that drives organic traffic, achieves design goals, and surpasses marketing milestones. Here is how we do it.  Custom Dental Web Design  Dentists have different specializations and target audiences. For example, we work with hundreds of hygienists and periodontists who require a website that showcases before and after cases of patients eliminating cavities and tooth decay. We are also the premier dental website company for orthodontists who want to break down the pros and cons of clear aligners and traditional braces through digital marketing techniques so clients do not leave one-star reviews when they discover Invisalign requires multiple return trips to the clinic.  Frictionless Purchases on Your New Website  Dental websites must be informative and attractive while allowing frictionless purchases and bookings. A custom design from digital marketing professionals can help you achieve and maintain those attributes. As your new website attracts more visitors and patients, it will be more efficient at helping them find the product or service they require from your practice. A dental website design company calls this process of eliminating inconveniences to a purchase or point-of-contact frictionless shopping, which is standard practice in e-commerce. We can integrate online and offline payment options, delivery schedules, or booking capabilities into your dental website to help patients access the help they need faster.  A Dental Website with Zero Downtime and Fast Load Speeds  Your dental website helps customers create a mental image of your practice. If your dental web design is buggy, lagging, and frequently crashing, they will assume your dental services will have the same quality. Research from Infrascale reveals more than 37% of small to mid-sized businesses in the United States lost clients from poor website design services and hosting that caused downtime, and around 17% lost thousands of dollars in revenue. An independent dental website design company like KickStart relies on providing landing pages, feeds, and menus with fast-load speeds, lightning response times, and one-touch contacting capabilities to keep new patients engaged and browsing. Once a visitor clicks off your dental website, chances are slim that they will search for your dental clinic again. We are experts in creating a website design that is attractive and easy to use, with fresh and high-quality content available to patients with a broad range of dental issues. We also provide free security and optimization updates to keep your dental web design resistant to hackers, data miners, and malicious actors.  Dental Website Design with Optimized Integrations  Our range of marketing services can integrate trustworthy medical journals like JADA, JDR, and BDJ into your website design for new patients looking for reliable sources of information about their dental condition. These website elements will convince a search engine like Google and your visitors that your brand, blog page, and clinic supports authoritative sources, bumping you higher in the search queue. The best dental websites carry links to interactive and visual media, like YouTube videos and other educational tools. As a sought-after dental website design company, we take it to the next level and include social media integration, off-site review information, and practice videos in our development process. Business-minded sites can be monotonous, even if they land among the top search results on a Google page. So, our dental website designer balances colorful elements with truthful information to keep your brand engaging and separate it from a thousand other companies offering the same products.  High-Quality Reporting and Analytics to Improve Your Website  As a dental website design company, we use data from website reports and Google analytics to pitch a new blog page, websites for secondary locations, and changes to your web design that will appeal to the sensibilities of more patients.  Design companies often use statistics to accomplish the following on a website: Estimate the probability that a will repurchase a product after buying it in the past. Tailor your business websites for patients that visit repeatedly or attract new ones from different market segments. Observe nearby client bases to determine whether you need a new site for a specific geography. Monitor the spending and contact information of individual patients or customer groups. Predict which dental web products patients want from Google searches, clicks, and brand mentions on other dental websites.  Optimization is an essential component of dental website design and development. The Local Consumer Review Survey from Brightlocal reveals 91% of consumers prefer businesses with excellent web-based reviews.  What Can You Expect From a Website Design Company?  Dental websites require hundreds of hours to build for untrained coders and writers from freelance agencies. A dental website company like KickStart has a streamlined workflow and multiple teams working with dentists, customers, and site managers that will help you invent your brand and play an active role in its evolution online.
Every dentist and the stakeholders of their practice can expect the following from our web design team:   A new website with mobile integration capabilities for Android, iOS, and HarmonyOS SEO for Google, Yahoo, and other engines Authentic website content unique to your dental practice Video and animated background capabilities on your new website Website performance data from Google Analytics and other tracking software An SEO dashboard accessible 24/7 from Google and third-party entryways Class-leading hosting speeds for dentists 100% website personalization   How Design Companies Work for a Dental Practice  Your Website Launch Call  Your design process begins by calling our website design team. We will define your conversion, reach, and design goals to create site maps, milestones, and focal points.  Your Website Skeleton  We will access market data relating to patient psychology to create landing pages, educational SEO posts, and About Us stories that will appeal to your target demographic without overselling or becoming untruthful.  Website Presentation  Our photography and writing team will work with you to create image, video, and text-based SEO assets for your new website. We will walk you through the finalized version of everything before launch.  Website Launch and Fine-Tuning  We will launch your website to the buying public and collect impressions, feedback, and engagement data for further optimization. Fine-tuning will enable you to attract more visitors and convert them into patients.  Yes, you pay for results, so Google ads ensure that it positions your advertisement in an optimal spot. Achieving the same kind of positioning through on-site SEO is not only extremely challenging but also difficult to maintain. PPC for dentists offers a simpler option, but it can be challenging to manage if you run a busy dental practice. The results also depend on the quality of your landing page. With the right focus on your dental practice and dental services, however, your Google ad campaign will be successful.

 A great STRATEGy
PROVEN MARKETING GAMEPLANS FOR THE DENTAL INDUSTRY
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						GENERAL DENTISTS
						Get the demographic right and create a compelling call-to-action. Develop a unique selling proposition (USP) answering the “why you” question.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						COSMETIC DENTISTS
						Hone in on your potential patient’s emotions. You aren’t selling a product or service; you are selling a solution to a problem.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						PEDIATRIC DENTISTS
						Remember, your marketing needs to speak to parents & guardians, not children. Your marketing theme needs to be all-around trust & security.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						FEE FOR SERVICE PRACTICES
						It will be critical to get the messaging right here. There are plenty of fee for service patients out there; you just need to know how to speak to them.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						ORTHODONTISTS
						There is a substantial market for adult braces, and your marketing needs to adjust for this. Using social media to get referrals from past patients will be critical.
					
				
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					
					
						DENTAL START-UPS
						A strong start will be important. You will need to build credibility quickly, whether you are taking over an existing practice or starting from scratch. A lot of moving parts here; there is no time for mistakes or wasted money.

				real-world applications of Callguard™
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				scenario #1
			
				
				
				
				
				The practice owner wants to understand how well calls are handled but doesn’t have time to listen to recordings or read through lengthy transcripts.
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				How callguard™ helps
			
				
				
				
				
				CallGuard™ automatically generates concise call summaries, making it easy to review what happened on each call, the outcome, and any follow-up recommendations—saving time while still ensuring quality control.
			
			
				
				
				
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				scenario #2
			
				
				
				
				
				A dental practice is receiving a high volume of calls, but some potential new patients aren’t booking appointments because the front desk staff struggles to answer inquiries effectively. The practice owner has no insight into why leads aren’t converting.
			
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				How callguard™ helps

				scenario #3
			
				
				
				
				
				Every time a new receptionist is hired, there’s a learning curve. Some team members are great at converting callers into patients, while others struggle, leading to inconsistent results.

				KickStart Dental Marketing’s CallGuard™ is the ultimate AI-powered call tracking solution for dental practices, ensuring every patient inquiry is maximized for conversion.

CallGuard™ goes beyond basic call tracking—it analyzes, categorizes, and provides real-time training feedback to help your front desk team turn more calls into scheduled appointments.
With CallGuard™, you’ll know exactly where each call is coming from, whether it’s Google Ads, organic search, Facebook, or other marketing channels. This allows you to optimize your advertising spend and focus on what truly drives new patient leads. The AI system also classifies calls automatically, distinguishing between new patient inquiries, existing patients, and non-relevant calls, helping you make data-driven decisions about front desk performance and marketing ROI.

					Castle Rock Dental Health has been working with Kickstart for about a year to improve our online visibility. We’ve seen the amount of our reviews go way up and we’re getting lots of new patient leads. What I like about the Kickstart team is their responsiveness—-I can alway reach our dedicated team members by phone or email or even text almost immediately. They’ve been extremely helpful with any concerns we’ve had. It’s a good feeling to know that they acknowledge me as a person, and not just another business they’re serving.
					Dr. Linda Ludin
					Owner, Castle Rock Dental Health
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
					They are the best decision we’ve made in our practice! This team has made a huge difference for us. Our phones weren’t ringing until we called them. Can’t say enough good things about Chris, Jennifer, and the whole team! I’m glad to have them on our team!
					Dr. Reinaldo Lasanta
					Owner, H&L Dentistry
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
					KickStart has done a great job in dramatically increasing new patient counts in all three of our practices. Their system makes it very easy for us to see exactly how their campaign is affecting our bottom line.
					Dr. Landon Blatter
					Owner, Aspen Springs Dental & Aurora Family Dentistry
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
					I love this company. Since I hired them, they have been very supportive, even in the most difficult times during the first months of Covid when we needed help more than ever. They respond right away when you have questions or concerns. I’ve had an excellent response to my business. They are definitely making my business grow. I would recommend Kickstart to anyone who wants to have a reliable marketing agency.
					Dr. Maricela Murillo
					Owner, M&M Dental 
				
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
					Finally, a dental marketing group that doesn’t spin hype and promises only to underperform with results. After being with the “big boys” I was fed up with large fees and lackluster returns and decided to try Kickstart Dental Marketing. What a difference Kickstart is… the Best of the Best. You really do get individualized care with a team that takes personal pride in building a partnership and getting you results. They are innovative and always looking for new tools or ideas to help you grow your practice. I noticed a difference even in the first month but the ROI and solid performance speak for themselves.

for Dentists  Are you struggling with social media marketing for dentists? Contact KickStart Dental Marketing to cut through the confusion and see real results from your social media marketing efforts.  Book A Strategy Call        What Is Social Media Marketing?  Social Media Marketing is an essential tool for dental practices aiming to enhance their online presence and attract new patients. In today’s digital landscape, where consumers increasingly turn to social media for information and recommendations, having a dynamic and engaging presence on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter is vital. For dental practices, social media marketing isn’t just about advertising services; it’s about establishing trust, showcasing expertise, and building relationships with both existing and potential patients. This approach not only enhances brand awareness but also fosters a community around your practice, ultimately leading to increased patient engagement and growth.          Key Takeaways         Engaging Content Strategies Craft targeted, engaging content to establish your dental practice as a trusted authority online. This approach boosts visibility, showcases services, and fosters patient trust.       Optimized Multi-Platform Use Utilize various social media platforms strategically to maximize your reach and engagement. Each platform serves a unique purpose in connecting with different patient demographics.         Trust-Building Online Interaction Foster trust and rapport through active social media engagement. Respond to queries, share patient stories, and build a community around your practice to deepen patient relationships.       Expert Social Media Management Professional management of your social media ensures consistency, quality, and strategic content delivery. This enhances your online presence and attracts the right patient audience.          Social Media Marketing for Dentists That Achieves Results  Managing a social media platform may not seem important to dental professionals because it can quickly become time-consuming. However, you can’t deny the benefits of a consistent social media strategy. KickStart Dental Marketing helps you entice new dental patients while promoting better engagement with existing patients across several social media channels. Harness the power of these outstanding tools in the most effortless way possible.  Why Choose at Least One Social Media Channel?  In the digital world, the lines blur constantly. Consumers today rely far more on social media platforms than ever before. They use them as a source of news, information, entertainment, and even as a shopping channel. With this increased focus, you would think digital marketing would be easier than ever. However, you’d be wrong. Today’s consumers continuously look for fresh content ideas that show that your brand is sincerely trying to engage with them. Ten years ago, not having a website was a severe hit for your brand image. Today a dental practice’s business page on social media platforms is equally important. How well you manage your Facebook page or other social media channels today determines how easily you can attract patients.  Social Media Management  Does that mean you need to try and crown a tooth with one hand while tweeting about it with the other? Of course not, and at some level, people understand that it’s not realistic to manage social media accounts 24/7. However, we live in a society that prioritizes instant gratification. If your dental office cannot answer questions on your social media page immediately, it may negatively impact your brand image. You also need to be ready to deal with negative fallout. Let us assist you with assessing and managing your client’s journey with you. Our team will create a winning social media management and marketing plan to deal with the following:   Useful Trends Reputation Management Campaign Creation and Monitoring Content Marketing   Social Media Marketing Strategy  Establishing your dental office as a valuable member of the community involves more than just placing ads. We create a holistic dental social media marketing plan incorporating several elements to help you reach your goals. We may use ads to drive qualified leads, trend-driven marketing campaigns, and useful content strategies to keep you in the public eye. We may also recommend using retargeting strategies to hook clients who leave your site. We create quality content that your followers will want to share, organically increasing your reach. Our process is simple. We:   Speak to you about your objectives for your practice Identify your ideal target market Optimize your ad campaigns Monitor your social media for dentists carefully and enhance the results   Social Media Posts  How often you need to post depends on your followers and your goals. Many companies now post several times a day to stay current in the feeds and engage with followers. Coming up with that many ideas can prove challenging. Fortunately, we have a team of content specialists who focus on social media for dentists. They will create engaging, useful posts that improve your image and promote your website.  Influencer Marketing  Love them or hate them, influencers are here to stay. Getting the right one on board with social media posts and videos can significantly boost patient numbers. We can assist in finding the right influencer for your business and negotiating a fair deal with them.  Gaining Engagement on Social Media Platforms  Trying to reach patients on social platforms can prove challenging. If you put in too many patient testimonials, you come across as selling your service, which can become off-putting. Creating compelling dental social media content provides a far more effective way of promoting your dental practice.  A New Patient Appointment for Your Dental Practice  Why do dental practices bother with a dental social media marketing strategy? Facebook and other channels do little to boost your website ranking with search engines. Where these channels are useful concerns establishing your expertise in the market and keeping your practice visible. At the end of the day, dental social media marketing is all about converting more patients. So, much like building a website, it makes sense to hand the task to professionals. It does this in three ways:   Engagement: By building an image of trustworthiness and caring, you engender loyalty in your followers. They will willingly help you spread the word. Brand Awareness: The more recognizable your clinic, the easier you can attract new patients. Seeing occasional patient testimonials can reinforce this opinion. Relationships: Patients may complain, compliment, or ask questions on social media. How you respond tells them and other potential patients how much you value your clients.   Dental Social Media Branding  Maintaining a consistent brand across social media proves critical to success. Considering how many social media platforms exist, however, this can be challenging. Working with a professional team ensures that you always project professional branding.  Content Writing  Social media users will share outstanding content. By doing so, they market your practice for you and also reinforce your dentists’ expertise. Use this opportunity to truly connect with users by providing valuable information through social media marketing for dentists.  Bringing It All Together for Dental Practices  We have covered much ground about social media sites and social media posts. However, we’ve also barely scratched the surface. Do you require one of the above for your social media pages or a combination? If you want your social media marketing to reel in as many new patients for your dental practice as possible, you need a carefully coordinated strategy. We assist by choosing optimal keywords and content to make your dental practice a valuable source of information on social media. Over time, your reach expands, and your practice grows at a reasonable pace.  The Best Social Media Sites for Your Dental Practice  Social media for dentists centers on optimizing your presence on these channels. It is, therefore, counterproductive to try and manage pages across all the channels. The following sites make the most valuable options for your practice.  Facebook  Let us assist you with reasonably priced Facebook marketing to drive qualified leads to your practice. We also develop a content calendar to create useful Facebook posts, provide advice, and direct traffic to interesting blog posts. By doing so, we establish your practice as a subject matter expert and improve visibility.  Instagram  Instagram remains very popular due to the highly visual nature of the content. This is the place to promote those pearly white veneers and the results of using Invisalign. You can use video content to create helpful tutorials while you subtly promote yourself as a subject matter expert. Instagram provides several opportunities to engage with your followers in a meaningful manner.  YouTube  YouTube comes second only to Google as a search engine. This video platform offers the ideal place to post evergreen social media content to which you wish to refer again and again. You may even use it as a repository for your short Facebook posts about your dental services.  X (Formerly Twitter)  X is short and sweet for patients and dentists on the move. Unlike Facebook, tweets have a limited length. This means that you must keep your social media marketing message on point. X makes an excellent platform for answering questions and dealing with concerns.  LinkedIn  LinkedIn is a site for professionals to connect with one another. With more of a focus on business, it provides a great opportunity for thought leadership posts and making meaningful connections. You can pick up new patients for your dental practice on this social media platform as well.  Need Help?

Book A Strategy Call        FAQ   How does social media marketing benefit dental practices? Social media marketing for dental practices enhances brand awareness, builds trust with patients, and facilitates a deeper connection with the community. It allows practices to showcase their services, share valuable dental health tips, and engage directly with both existing and potential patients.  What social media platforms are most effective for dentists? The most effective platforms for dentists are Facebook, for its wide reach and community features; Instagram, for showcasing visual content like smile transformations; YouTube, for detailed dental procedure videos; X (Twitter), for quick updates and engagements; and LinkedIn, for professional networking.   How often should dental practices post on social media? The frequency of posts depends on the specific platform and the practice’s goals. However, a consistent posting schedule is crucial. Many practices find success with multiple posts per week, ensuring they remain active and visible in their followers’ feeds.  Is it important to have a professional manage my practice’s social media? Yes, professional management is key to maintaining a consistent, high-quality online presence. Experts in social media marketing can strategically create and curate content, engage with the audience, and effectively manage your practice’s reputation online.  Can social media marketing help in attracting new patients? Absolutely. Social media marketing can significantly increase a dental practice’s visibility and reach. By showcasing services, sharing patient testimonials, and engaging with the community, social media can attract new patients and grow the practice.

				Studies show that nearly 80% of callers who reach voicemail won’t leave a message—instead, they’ll call another provider. In a busy dental office, it’s impossible for staff to answer every call, and relying on voicemail alone is no longer enough. Patients expect instant responses, and if they don’t get one, they’ll often move on to a competitor.
PatientLine AI™ is the smartest, simplest way to ensure every patient call is answered promptly, personally, and professionally—even when your front desk is busy or your practice is closed.

				Google Ads for Dentists That Get Results
			
				
				
				
				
				Digital marketing is more complex than it appears initially. Without professional assistance, it can become a frustrating trial-and-error process with a steep learning curve. Cut to the head of the class by partnering with Kickstart Dental Marketing.
Our experienced team will help you create winning Google ads campaigns that drive qualified leads to your site.
			
				
				
				
				
				Why Choose a Google Ads Campaign?
			
				
				
				
				
				Google ranks as the world’s largest search engine, blowing the competition out of the water. The phrase “google it” gives clear evidence of the search engine’s popularity. If you choose to advertise with the site, you become part of a machine that drives almost seven billion searches every day.
You don’t, however, need that search volume to be successful, and this is where Google search ups the ante for your dental PPC campaign. You can create online marketing campaigns tailored to every new patient in your target audience.
By targeting the correct search term, creating an enticing ad, and ensuring landing page relevance, you can create a winning PPC advertising campaign. Best of all, you pay for results—but only if someone clicks on your ad through to your business profile.
			
				
				
				
				
				How Google Search Ads Work
			
				
				
				
				
				With Google AdWords for dentists, you target specific search terms or keywords. You then bid on how much you will pay when someone takes action on your ad. You can opt to pay for:

Views of your Google ads campaign
Click through rate
Clickthroughs to your dental clinic landing pages

Sounds simple, doesn’t it? In reality, however, you must compete with every other dentist in the area using the same technique. If they word their ads better or pay more per bid, their ads will appear more often.
It’s here that experience becomes invaluable in optimizing your ad campaign without blowing your budget. To better understand this, it helps to know how Google determines the best answer for a search query. The algorithm considers the searcher’s:

Location
Browsing history
Intent

Google will then display the ads for dental patients above the search results. This shows how search engines can drive more traffic to your site. You can, therefore, improve the advertising of your dentistry practice with keyword research.
			
				
				
				
				
				Starting Your First Google Campaign
			
				
				
				
				
				You can easily create a Google ad with the instructions on-site. The downside, however, is that finding the best keywords to target for ads may prove difficult. You can use the Google Keyword Tool to get ideas of search terms and volumes, but this can be tricky.
Ideally, you want a low-competition keyword with enough search volume to make it worthwhile. In such cases, it pays to be specific with Google ads. Try something like “endodontist in Windemere, Orlando,” rather than “dental practices in Orlando, Florida.”
Why?
The goal here aims to create ads to entice new patients. While many more searches occur for a dentist than an endodontist, broad targeting ads may be a waste of money if you have a specialist practice.
Our team works with Google every day and knows how to get results with every ad. Don’t waste time trying to figure it out for yourself when you can better spend that time treating your patients.
Examples of keywords we might target in your ad include the following:

Local Dentist
Dental Practices
Family Dentist
Orthodontist
Dental Treatment
Emergency Dentist
Dental Implants

We can narrow it down further by explaining the type of dentist, for example, cosmetic dentist. Then we can take your ad a step further by adding the area you serve to ensure the ad brings feet through the door.
			
				
				
				
				
				Should You Target More Than One Area in Your Ads?
			
				
				
				
				
				This depends on which areas of your community you serve. See where most of your customers or ideal customers live and target those areas. You can encompass other areas in your ad if you believe that clients will drive to your clinic.
The concept here is to improve your pool of potential leads but still be realistic. If your office is located in Orlando, showing up in an ad at the top of a Google page in Brisbane, Australia, will not offer any useful leads for you. You need clients within driving distance. You can select cities, neighborhoods, regions, or zip codes.
			
				
				
				
				
				Set Your Budget for Google Ads
			
				
				
				
				
				Another useful feature of Google Ads includes making it difficult to overspend. You select your bid and your maximum budget. You can either choose to spend a set amount daily or opt for a certain number of clicks. When you reach either limit, your ads stop for the day.
A good rule of thumb involves aiming for about five to ten clicks daily. We recommend running your campaign for at least three to four weeks.
			
				
				
				
				
				Is That All You Need To Do for Dental Practice Google Ads?
			
				
				
				
				
				Creating an ad for your dental office gives you a good start, but is it the best way to attract attention to your business profile? The answer is that the only way to know for sure may require tweaking the ad.
You will now run split ad tests in which you change one thing in the ad. You can, for example, vary the call to action slightly or change where you place the keywords. You’ll run both Google ads simultaneously to see which performs better with your target audience.
			
				
				
				
				
				Does This Strategy Work for Any Dental Practice Landing Page?
			
				
				
				
				
				Yes, you pay for results, so Google ads ensure that it positions your advertisement in an optimal spot. Achieving the same kind of positioning through on-site SEO is not only extremely challenging but also difficult to maintain.
PPC for dentists offers a simpler option, but it can be challenging to manage if you run a busy dental practice. The results also depend on the quality of your landing page. With the right focus on your dental practice and dental services, however, your Google ad campaign will be successful.
			
				
				
				
				
				How We Advertise You as a Dentist Using Google Ads
			
				
				
				
				
				Setting up a simple campaign is easy enough, and it will generate some results. However, if you want to optimize those results with a minimal budget, you need to use the “Expert Mode.” This unlocks several valuable features, which require some expertise to use.
Our team uses these features every day, so we ask you to create a list of your unique value propositions. We will use these as the basis on which to create a high-converting campaign. We then use expert features to run diverse campaigns like:

Video
Search Network
Shopping
Apps

We then set up your campaign according to three categories:

Campaigns
Account
Ad Groups

			
				
				
				
				
				Google Advanced Keyword Research and Search Ads
			
				
				
				
				
				We shine in identifying the right balance of keywords to attract the patients who need and can afford your services. Some dentists start by trying to outbid other users. While this broad targeting strategy will boost traffic, it becomes expensive very quickly.
Our team identifies the best value-for-money keywords and phrases, and then we take them to the next level. We look for high-value, low-volume key phrases to minimize your expenses.
For example, instead of targeting “dentists in Orlando, FL,” we might target “dental implants in Orlando, FL.” We use tools such as the Google Ads Keyword Planner Tool to correctly identify the right phrases and predict search volumes.
			
				
				
				
				
				Negative Keywords and Your Google Ads Campaign
			
				
				
				
				
				While key phrases are important, you will find it just as critical to avoid negative keywords. For example, if you want to advertise that you offer braces. Using the term braces might, however, also bring up back braces. That result won’t be useful at all, so you can use the term “back” as a negative keyword.

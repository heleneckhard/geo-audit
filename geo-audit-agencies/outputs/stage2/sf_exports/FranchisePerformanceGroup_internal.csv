FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetype, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.The challenges we solve
Finding experienced franchise recruiters. FPG provides outsourced recruiters on a full-time or part-time basis depending on the needs of your brand. Our recruiters have strong conversation, presentation and problem-solving skills, but what truly sets our team apart is that they are also well-versed in modern sales techniques such as CRM management, pipeline reporting, and digital marketing. With franchise buyers increasingly using self-directed online research to learn about business opportunities, much of the communication that used to happen over the phone is now happening online. We have the skills to maximize your sales opportunities.Improving the ROI of your franchise development efforts
By effectively managing your sales pipeline, FPG’s recruiters can help you close more deals and book more revenue, improving the ROI of your franchise recruitment efforts.
By understanding how various marketing efforts are translating into deals, we can lower the cost-per-acquisition of your franchise development advertising and direct dollars to the most effective marketing channels.
We can also save brands money. Many emerging and mid-sized franchise brands do not need a full-time senior-level franchise development director. We provide incremental staffing solutions to help brands access expert talent that fits their needs and budgets.Simplified oversight
FPG’s team operates at an executive level and can manage all aspects of your franchise development. That includes managing and coaching junior recruiters (yours or ours), providing board-ready reports, and handling franchise marketing efforts. That includes managing relationships with franchise portals, brokers, and third-party advertising partners. Instead of managing a dozen vendors, you only need to keep track of one — us.For more information on Franchise Sales, check out these posts.

FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetype, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.Case Studies:Marco’s PizzaSportclipsChristian Brothers AutomotiveCollege Hunksi9 SportsCASE STUDY
Marco's Pizza
Marco’s Pizza was founded by Italian immigrant Pasquale “Pat” Giammarco in 1978. Restaurant industry luminary Jack Butorac assumed leadership of the company in January 2004 with his acquisition of the brand.Jack Butorac, CEO of Marco’s Pizza, stated that, “In 2010 Marco’s had grown to 375 locations. We contracted with FPG to leverage their franchising domain area expertise. FPG worked with Marco’s MET (Marco’s Executive Team) and Marco’s ARLC (Area Representative Leadership Council.) FPG then was asked to assist Marco’s in increasing franchise sales by improving their recruitment process and franchise sales support program for our nationwide network of Area Representatives. FPG offered Area Representatives lead screen and franchisee recruitment services. Additionally, FPG’s digital marketing team designed and implemented Marco’s lead generation and lead nurturing content strategy.”
Marco’s was a 37-year-old brand under new ownership but was plateauing as franchisee relationships became strained and existing franchisees were not opening new stores as planned. FPG initially focused on helping to improve franchisee-franchisor relations as part of Marco’s MET and ARLC committees, and after 12 months, those franchisee-franchisor relationships improved.Additionally, FPG provided core functional expertise and resources including: digital marketing services, strategic advisory services, strategic bank relationships for all franchisee lending types, outsourced franchisee recruitment services, and provided strategic advice to executive management. 
As of mid-2020, there are almost 1000 franchised Marco’s Pizza locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and India. Most recently, it was announced that Marco’s Pizza has doubled its size and expects to open its 1,000th store by the end of 2018.
Marco's Pizza is America's Most Loved and Most Trusted Pizza Brand, according to the 2019 Harris Poll EquiTrend® Study. Marco's was also ranked No. 2 in the Pizza category on Entrepreneur Magazine's 2020 ""Franchise 500"" ranking, No. 6 in the Largest Pizza Chain category on Restaurant Business' 2020 ""Top 500 Chains"" ranking, and made QSR's prestigious 2020 ""Top 50 Chains"" list. They also ranked No. 4 in Forbes 2019 ""Best Franchises to Buy"" Small/Medium Investment and ranking five consecutive years on Nation's Restaurant News' prestigious ""Top 200"" ranking.Marco’s has since become one of the fastest growing pizza chains in the highly competitive $40 billion pizza category. During that time, Marco’s grew from 375 locations to over 900 locations in 3 countries. System sales grew from $221 million to over $700 million. Royalty revenue increased from $10 million to about $27 Million. Marco’s is now the 6th largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Little Caesar’s, Papa John’s, and Papa Murphy’s. Marco’s recommends FPG as a strategic partner.Jack Butorac, CEO of Marco’s Pizza, 4/15/2019CASE STUDY
Sport Clips
FPG helped grow Sport Clips from 350 units to more than 1,500, providing strategic advice to the Vice President of Development, designing the franchisee recruitment process, and writing training materials and providing support for area developers. FPG also provided franchisee recruitment services for turnaround markets.CASE STUDY
Christian Brothers Automotive
Christian Brothers Automotive grew from 80 to 190 units while working with FPG from 2012 to 2019.

i9 Sports
Born out of a desire to break free from the constraints of corporate America, founder Frank Fiume launched i9 Sports in 2003.Fiume created i9 Sports out of a passionate drive to create youth sports experiences in well-organized and high-quality sports leagues alongside developmentally appropriate instruction for all age groups. i9 Sports has created a business opportunity that franchise owners can feel passionate about running, while also offering work-life balance and continual franchisor support.
With over 2 million registrations in over 130 communities across the country, i9 Sports offers youth sports leagues, camps, and clinics for boys and girls ages 3 and up in today’s most popular sports such as flag football, soccer, basketball, baseball, and ZIP Lacrosse™.
Fiume, founder of i9 Sports Corporation, had this to say about his experience with FPG recently:
“In September 2005, out of desperation to turn things around quickly, I attended a franchisor conference in Hollywood, FL, to learning everything I could to get us back on track. FPG was moderating that session. Our company was in dire financial straits, only six months from extinction. Worse yet, I had an erratic management team and dozens of failing franchisees that had not amassed enough critical mass for us to survive on royalties. FPG’s opinion was that our business model was strong, but we were deficient in basic fundamentals. We hired FPG to revamp our operations model, retrain staff, tighten support, and fine-tune every aspect of our operation, 'blocking and tackling' as they described it. At the time we completed the basic consulting project with FPG, we were down to our last $15,000 in the business.
""First, FPG recommend we clean house, removing unproductive employees and leaders who lacked the capacity to help us turn around. Next, we revamped our operating system, making it more of an easy-to-follow cookbook for success.""FPG and i9 Sports worked together to revamp our ramp-up strategy, increasing first-year registrations by 300% out of the gate, making the franchisees time to breakeven much shorter. FPG went into their network of executives to bring on a marketing expert to crystallize our consumer value proposition and to recreate our customer experience, which we now call 'the i9 Sports Experience,' which also includes the parents’ experience. Based on recommendations, we raised prices, driving revenue and cash flow.
""If I had not taken the risk of swiftly bringing in FPG, we would have failed.
In 2017 we hired FPG again to reinvent our struggling franchise sales program. We had only recruited 1 new franchisee over the previous 9 months prior to FPG. FPG saw we had gotten off message and were not communicating our value correctly to our target franchisee. They reinvented our franchisee recruitment program, staffed the department with two FPG recruiters, and developed and implemented national resales to help franchisees exit. FPG designed a new franchise opportunity content strategy, digital marketing lead generation program, sales presentation, lead nurturing content, and recruitment process. Within 90 days, i9 Sports was onboarding over 1 franchisee per month and kept that pace for almost two years.
""We highly recommend FPG as a strategic growth partner and franchising domain experts.”
With FPG’s involvement as a strategic partner between 2005 and 2018, i9 Sports grew from 25 to over 130 territories, systemwide sales grew from $5 million to $70 million, and EBITDA grew from under $100,000 to $2.8 million. Currently, i9 Sports has more than 130 franchise locations across 28 states.

Marco's Pizza
Marco’s Pizza was founded by Italian immigrant Pasquale “Pat” Giammarco in 1978. Restaurant industry luminary Jack Butorac assumed leadership of the company in January 2004 with his acquisition of the brand.Jack Butorac, CEO of Marco’s Pizza, stated that, “In 2010 Marco’s had grown to 375 locations. We contracted with FPG to leverage their franchising domain area expertise. FPG worked with Marco’s MET (Marco’s Executive Team) and Marco’s ARLC (Area Representative Leadership Council.) FPG then was asked to assist Marco’s in increasing franchise sales by improving their recruitment process and franchise sales support program for our nationwide network of Area Representatives. FPG offered Area Representatives lead screen and franchisee recruitment services. Additionally, FPG’s digital marketing team designed and implemented Marco’s lead generation and lead nurturing content strategy.”
Marco’s was a 37-year-old brand under new ownership but was plateauing as franchisee relationships became strained and existing franchisees were not opening new stores as planned. FPG initially focused on helping to improve franchisee-franchisor relations as part of Marco’s MET and ARLC committees, and after 12 months, those franchisee-franchisor relationships improved.Additionally, FPG provided core functional expertise and resources including: digital marketing services, strategic advisory services, strategic bank relationships for all franchisee lending types, outsourced franchisee recruitment services, and provided strategic advice to executive management. 
As of mid-2020, there are almost 1000 franchised Marco’s Pizza locations in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and India. Most recently, it was announced that Marco’s Pizza has doubled its size and expects to open its 1,000th store by the end of 2018.
Marco's Pizza is America's Most Loved and Most Trusted Pizza Brand, according to the 2019 Harris Poll EquiTrend® Study. Marco's was also ranked No. 2 in the Pizza category on Entrepreneur Magazine's 2020 ""Franchise 500"" ranking, No. 6 in the Largest Pizza Chain category on Restaurant Business' 2020 ""Top 500 Chains"" ranking, and made QSR's prestigious 2020 ""Top 50 Chains"" list. They also ranked No. 4 in Forbes 2019 ""Best Franchises to Buy"" Small/Medium Investment and ranking five consecutive years on Nation's Restaurant News' prestigious ""Top 200"" ranking.Marco’s has since become one of the fastest growing pizza chains in the highly competitive $40 billion pizza category. During that time, Marco’s grew from 375 locations to over 900 locations in 3 countries. System sales grew from $221 million to over $700 million. Royalty revenue increased from $10 million to about $27 Million. Marco’s is now the 6th largest pizza chain in the United States, behind Pizza Hut, Domino’s, Little Caesar’s, Papa John’s, and Papa Murphy’s. Marco’s recommends FPG as a strategic partner.Jack Butorac, CEO of Marco’s Pizza, 4/15/2019CASE STUDY

  Your franchise information website should be the cornerstone of your franchise recruitment efforts
Millions of people research franchise opportunities each year
When franchise candidates research potential investments, they spend two-thirds of their research journey online — before they ever talk to a recruiter.Buyers conduct extensive research before investing in a brand
When FPG studied user behavior on our clients’ websites in 2019, we found that the average lead spends about 20 minutes on a site while the average buyer spends about 3 hours reading the franchise information site.Based on the content they consumed, revisited, and pored over, we can say with confidence that franchise buyers want to have a strong understanding of both the business model and the culture of your brand. They want to see the numbers. But they also want to see the humanity within the business. They want stories.
Here’s the core of what our franchise information websites deliver:

An explanation of your business model
Details about the support you offer franchisees
An examination of costs and potential ROI
A sense of your brand’s culture
Storytelling that focuses on your franchisees and leadership, particularly in ways that illustrate the points listed above
SEO so your site is likely to rank high in search results
Research pages that examine core questions people ask when buying franchises
A News & Blog section that can be used to provide frequent updates
Clear calls-to-action that boost the percentage of visitors who become leads
Mobile- and desktop-friendly designs that are based on user behavior
FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetypes, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.FPG includes a full digital marketing agency

FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetype, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.Our websites are designed specifically for your best buyers
Who are your top-performing franchisees and what do they have in common?What are their backgrounds? What are their personalities? What dreams and pain points motivate them to take action? What do they hope to accomplish, and why is your brand a strong choice for helping them reach their goals?
These are the questions FPG investigates before we create the content for a website. Franchisees tend to fall into one of 10 broad categories of buyers, and each group evaluates brands a little bit differently. We develop your website’s content with buyer personas in mind, emphasizing different messages and using different communication styles to match the preferences of your best prospects.TIPS

 	If you’re not converting at least 2% of your visitors into leads, you probably need a new website.
 	Franchise buyers look for robust content. Short-form copywriting is important, but you need to provide much more info than you typically would for consumer marketing.
 	Your site should inform and engage. Facts, not puffery.
 	The content should be designed for the concerns and communication style of your target buyer.

When FPG studied user behavior on our clients’ websites in 2019, we found that the average lead spends about 20 minutes on a site while the average buyer spends about 3 hours reading the franchise information site.Based on the content they consumed, revisited, and pored over, we can say with confidence that franchise buyers want to have a strong understanding of both the business model and the culture of your brand. They want to see the numbers. But they also want to see the humanity within the business. They want stories.
Here’s the core of what our franchise information websites deliver:

An explanation of your business model
Details about the support you offer franchisees
An examination of costs and potential ROI
A sense of your brand’s culture
Storytelling that focuses on your franchisees and leadership, particularly in ways that illustrate the points listed above
SEO so your site is likely to rank high in search results
Research pages that examine core questions people ask when buying franchises
A News & Blog section that can be used to provide frequent updates
Clear calls-to-action that boost the percentage of visitors who become leads
Mobile- and desktop-friendly designs that are based on user behavior
FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetypes, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.FPG includes a full digital marketing agency
that specializes in franchise recruitment, and uses modern marketing tools to help brands reach more buyers — not just leads. Our toolkit includes:

FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetype, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.Our websites are designed specifically for your best buyers
Who are your top-performing franchisees and what do they have in common?What are their backgrounds? What are their personalities? What dreams and pain points motivate them to take action? What do they hope to accomplish, and why is your brand a strong choice for helping them reach their goals?
These are the questions FPG investigates before we create the content for a website. Franchisees tend to fall into one of 10 broad categories of buyers, and each group evaluates brands a little bit differently. We develop your website’s content with buyer personas in mind, emphasizing different messages and using different communication styles to match the preferences of your best prospects.TIPS

 	If you’re not converting at least 2% of your visitors into leads, you probably need a new website.
 	Franchise buyers look for robust content. Short-form copywriting is important, but you need to provide much more info than you typically would for consumer marketing.
 	Your site should inform and engage. Facts, not puffery.
 	The content should be designed for the concerns and communication style of your target buyer.

One of the biggest keys to successful franchise lead generation is driving as much traffic as you can to your franchise information site. Broadly speaking, there are two ways to drive traffic to your site:Inbound marketing
These are tactics like SEO, Google Search Ads, and status updates on social media sites — all of which ensure that your brand is easy to find when people are looking for information about you.Outbound marketing
These are tactics like email, social media, video/display advertising, and sponsored content ads that are shown to specific audiences you want to reach.Between your inbound and outbound efforts, you should have strategies in place to reach candidates at each stage of their research journey. The graphic above breaks down this journey into 12 steps — from the moment the candidate first starts dreaming of owning a business to the moment they sign a deal.

To maximize your results, you also need regular communications between your lead generation team and your sales team. FPG’s digital marketing team meets regularly with recruiters to:

Discuss the candidates in the pipeline
Discuss the conversations that are happening with leads and identify opportunities to develop more content to assist in the sales process
Trace the behavior of the best candidates and tie them back to the marketing efforts that helped them become leads

Franchise Lead Generation: Google Ads Best Practices & How to Maximize ROI
November 21, 2024
Back to BlogAt Franchise Performance Group (FPG), we’ve helped over 150 franchisors grow their brands through expert franchise lead generation. 
FPG defines lead generation as “intersecting a qualified franchise candidate who is looking for a business opportunity like yours at their point of interest.” Therefore, one of the most powerful tools in our arsenal is Google Ads. Here are our best practices for maximizing your ROI on Google franchise lead generation.
Focus on High-Intent Keywords
When it comes to franchise lead generation, not all keywords are created equal. We prioritize:

Hyper-focused category and industry-related franchise searches (e.g., “pizza franchise”, “QSR for sale”). Many agencies focus on broader terms and therefore waste your budget on consumer-focused traffic.  
Competitive traffic, both direct and indirect. Frankly, we steal franchise candidates from other brands and engage them with our advertising and content.
Brand-specific searches (especially important for high-profile brands). We protect our clients traffic from other brands.

Remember to use negative keywords to eliminate consumer-related traffic and focus on those truly interested in franchise opportunities. Negative keywords are words and phrases, that if a candidate uses these in a search, your ads do not show up which is critical so you don’t waste your budget. Have you ever called leads only to find they are looking for jobs or making consumer complaints?  This is because your agency doesn’t do an effective job eliminating consumer traffic through negative keywords such as “customer complaint” or “help wanted” in your franchise opportunity campaigns.   
Implement Value-Based Bidding
Our strategy at FPG is to maximize conversions to a target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA). Our target is to maintain a CPA under $200, but we commonly see that fluctuate between $100-$150 depending on the brands momentum, market conditions, and website experience. This approach ensures you’re not just getting leads, but leads that are likely to convert into franchisees. We are often asked “How many leads does it take to recruit a franchisee?”  The answer is 1. The right lead. The right lead is a byproduct of generating high quality traffic, which is an exercise in focus.
Create Dynamic Search Ads
We recommend creating 3-5 dynamic search ads per ad group. Include 5-10 headlines and 3-5 descriptions to give Google’s AI more options to match user intent. Always preview both mobile and desktop versions before going live. Avoid cliches that might work in consumer ads but turn off investors, like “Sink your teeth into this restaurant opportunity” or “Make dough with pizza.”
Use Ad Extensions Effectively
Leverage ad extensions to drive traffic to specific sections of your franchise development site. Include links to “About Us,” “FAQ,” and “Request More Information” pages. Your call-to-action should encourage users to learn more or download information.  Not only does this take up more ‘real estate’ on the search results page, but it also gives franchise candidates multiple points of entry to your website creating a better user experience.
Target the Right Demographics
Based on our experience with 150+ franchisors, we typically target:

Ages 24-64 (consider excluding 55-64 for some concepts)
Top 40% household income brackets. According to Forbes, about 25% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.   
Both parents and non-parents
Target geography where franchise validation is strong and your are most likely to close a deal
Consider creating specific time-windows for your ads to serve to avoid blowing budget on international traffic and spam. For example, you can setup your ads to only serve between 6am-11pm.

Lead with Your Numbers 
Feature content in your Item 19 or your FDD. Remember, this is an investment opportunity. At FPG, we specialize in blending beautiful ads while reinforcing that this is an investment opportunity. Below are a few examples of the creatives we’ve created for our clients.
       
Optimize for Mobile
With 96% of Facebook users accessing the platform via mobile devices, it’s crucial to ensure your ads and landing pages are mobile-optimized. However, with experience working across 150 brands, we’ve found that franchise candidates (the real in-market buyers) typically go on desktop to perform their own personal research.
Monitor and Adjust Regularly
At FPG, we examine lead counts daily and review budgets and cost per lead weekly. We make modifications based on trendline data to ensure continual improvement. An important note: if you make changes to campaigns too frequently, it’s common for campaigns to go back into ‘learning mode’ which delays the campaigns to gain efficiency. With efficiency comes more predictability.
Set Realistic Benchmarks and Measure the Right Things
Based on our experience, successful Google Ads campaigns for franchise lead generation typically see:

Cost Per Lead (CPL) under $200, and under $100 in some advertising vehicles.
Deal flow of .5-1% or more (leads to closed deals).
5% of leads to qualified applicants
20-25% or more of applications sign franchise agreements
Cost per acquisition of a franchisee: $8,000-$15,000 in ad spend

By following these best practices, we’ve helped numerous franchisors achieve impressive ROI on their Google lead generation efforts. Remember, the key is to continually test, learn, and optimize your approach.
At FPG, we’re committed to making it easy for skilled entrepreneurs and worthy brands to find each other. If you’re looking to supercharge your franchise lead generation efforts, we’re here to help.
Demand transparency
Know where your advertising dollars are going.  Measure only the statistics that matter most.  Agencies have ways of puffing up their numbers to make their statistics look good while at the same time your pipeline remains anemic.  Statistics like “Number of Impressions” may look impressive, but who cares.  Impression share is more important than number of impressions. 100,000 impressions might sound impressive, but if 10% or more of that traffic didn’t click on the ad to learn more, who cares?  And if 100,000 impressions led to an impression share under 10% that means your ad could have been shown 3-4X  more if your campaigns were designed properly and you achieved an impression share of 30%-40%.

Top 3 Ways for Franchisors to Generate Leads & Build a Robust Pipeline
December 16, 2024
Back to BlogAt Franchise Performance Group (FPG), we’ve helped over 150 franchisors grow their brands through effective franchise lead generation strategies. Based on our extensive experience, here are the top three ways for franchisors to generate leads and build a robust pipeline.
1. Optimize Your Digital Advertising Strategy
Digital advertising, particularly through Google Ads and Meta (Facebook/Instagram), remains one of the most cost effective ways to generate high-quality franchise leads and fill your pipeline with qualified and closable franchise candidates.
Google Ads Best Practices for Franchisors

Prioritize your budget on hyper-focused keywords and phrases with high intention and predisposition to your franchise category. 

Ex: “How do I start a children’s tutoring business” and not “best franchise to start”


Focus on “phrase match” bidding strategy and not “broad match.” Broad match might get you more form fills and the appearance of more leads, phrase match will earn you less form fills but more qualified candidates.
Create dynamic search ads with multiple headlines and descriptions. Avoid unsubstantiated superlatives like “hottest new franchise” and lead with your numbers, such as average unit sales. You have limited space to answer the following questions:

“What business are you in?”
“What is your value as a franchise?” 
“How much money can I make?” 


Use ad extensions to drive traffic to specific parts of your franchise development site.  Give yourself multiple entry points and calls to action. This is a fantastic use of real estate to answer the questions above.

Meta Advertising Tips

Design scroll-stopping ads that quickly communicate your value proposition
Leverage Meta’s Advantage+ placement for optimal ad distribution leading to more impressions and conversions.
Navigate special ad category restrictions by focusing on compelling messaging and creative. 

Key Metrics to Aim For:

Google Ads: CPL under $200, 1% or higher lead-to-close rate. Keep in mind a large percentage of your leads will go to the franchise opportunity website directly and not click the Google ad call to action, especially if they search for your brand name directly. To get a true cost per lead, you must monitor the increase in organic lead activity and assign some contribution to Google.

Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram): CPL under $100, 0.5% or higher lead-to-close rate.  Again, many leads will go to your website directly without clicking the ads’ call to action. Therefore, these leads may be tracked as organic when the true source is advertising. Ensure that you monitor the increase in organic lead activity and assign some value to Meta advertising. When designing display ads, lead with your numbers, not catchy but meaningless phrases like “Make real dough with pizza.”  
  
2. Implement a Comprehensive Lead Nurturing Strategy
Generating leads is only the first step. A robust nurturing strategy is crucial for moving prospects through your pipeline.
Key Components:

Create a robust franchise opportunity website that converts over 2% of unique visitors to form fills.
Initial 10-14 day nurture sequence (5 emails and 3 texts). If you need
12-month “life support” plan for longer-term nurturing
Multi-channel approach combining email, SMS, and retargeting ads
Personalized communication based on prospect behavior and preferences

Content Ideas:

Franchisee testimonials and success stories
Customer testimonials
Brand leadership interviews
Industry insights and trend reports
Behind-the-scenes looks at your franchise operations
Educational content about franchising and your specific opportunity

Remember to implement lead scoring to identify your most engaged prospects and focus your efforts effectively.
3. Leverage Content Marketing and SEO
While paid advertising can deliver quick results, a strong content marketing and SEO strategy provides long-term, sustainable lead generation. FPG measured the average franchise buyer goes to a website 18 visits and reads over 3 hours worth of content. Your franchise opportunity website is your hub for most lead nurturing content.

FPG measured the average franchise buyer goes to a website 18 visits and reads over 3 hours worth of content. Your franchise opportunity website is your hub for most lead nurturing content.  
Key Strategies:

Develop a content-rich franchise opportunity website
Create a downloadable franchise information ebook (aim for 15-30 pages)
Regularly publish blog posts, articles, and videos addressing common franchise questions
Optimize your content for both traditional and voice search
Guest post on reputable industry websites to build authority and backlinks

Focus Areas:

Educational content about franchising
Industry-specific insights and trends
Success stories and case studies
Transparency about your franchise opportunity (including financial performance)

To maximize the impact of your content:

Ensure all content is mobile-optimized
Use a mix of formats (text, video, infographics) to cater to different preferences
Promote your content through your social media channels and email lists
Continuously analyze performance and refine your strategy based on data

By implementing these three strategies – optimized digital advertising, comprehensive lead nurturing, and robust content marketing – franchisors can generate a steady stream of high-quality leads and build a robust pipeline.
At FPG, we’ve seen these strategies drive significant results for franchisors across various industries. Remember, the key to success is continuous optimization based on data and a commitment to providing value to your prospects throughout their journey.
Our mission at FPG is to make it easy for skilled entrepreneurs and worthy brands to find each other. By focusing on these top lead generation strategies, you’ll be well on your way to connecting with the right franchisees to grow your brand.

  We focus on attracting top-performing franchisee talent
OUR APPROACH
Our franchise development professionals see themselves as protectors of the integrity of the brand and corporate culture. They're not just looking to sell franchises — they are looking to recruit top-performing people to the organization, set them up to achieve their goals, and make the brand stronger as a result.A franchisor's success is directly linked to the quality and performance of the franchisees the brand attracts. Top-performing franchisees pay the most royalties while consuming the least amount time, money, and energy in franchise support. Conversely, underperforming franchisees contribute the least revenue, yet consume much more time, money, and energy.Top-performing franchisees are also happier.
By using digital lead generation tactics to attract strong candidates, and then qualifying those candidates to make sure they are well-positioned for success, and recruiting top quality franchisee talent, FPG helps franchisors and franchisees succeed together. Over time, this helps boost average sales volumes. It also increases the odds that when new candidates talk to your existing franchisees, they'll be talking to a happy and successful owner.FPG includes a full digital marketing agency
that specializes in franchise recruitment, and uses modern marketing tools to help brands reach more buyers — not just leads. Our toolkit includes:


 	Google advertising (display, CPC and retargeting)
 	Bing advertising (CPC and retargeting)
 	Facebook advertising (display and retargeting)
 	LinkedIn advertising (sponsored content, InMail, and conversation-based ads)
 	Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
 	YouTube advertising Streaming Channel ads (Hulu, Pluto, Tubi, etc.)
 	Programmatic advertising Geo-targeting
 	
Geo-targeting
 	
Geo-fencing
 	
Geo-framing
 	
Copywriting
 	
Video production
 	
Lead nurture emails and texts 
 	
E-blasts
FPG will analyze your brand, buyer archetype, goals and budget to determine what platforms from this listing should be used and how.Lead generation is easy
One of our core services is franchise lead generation, so you may be surprised that we say lead generation is easy. That's because it is. Deal generation, however, is where the real art form lies. There are many franchise industry vendors who can shovel leads at you all day long. Generating qualified leads is harder. That's what we specialize in. We take the time to learn your brand's culture and business model to understand your top-performing franchisees. From there, we build a profile of the people you want to attract to your brand.
Our entire process is designed to bring in top-performers. There are about 2 million franchise leads generated each year, but only 13,000-20,000 buyers. Our goal, from a franchise lead generation perspective, is to help brands increase the number of qualified candidates turning in franchise applications. We combine content strategy with data tracking to understand which leads are most likely to become deals and which marketing channels are most likely to generate valuable leads — and which marketing channels are just spending money with little-to-no bottom line return.
It's easy to get a ton of leads if quality doesn't matter. But of course it does. That's why we focus on applications.Franchise recruiting rather than franchise sales
According to FranConnect's Franchise Sales Index report for 2020, the average franchisor converts less than 2% of their leads into franchise applications.For FPG, it's about 10%. Part of our success is due to smarter lead generation. Part is due to our consultative approach with franchise candidates.
Here's a secret: Nobody in the history of the franchise industry has ever sold a franchise. Great franchise ""sales"" people simply find people who have a dream and point them toward a predictable way to make that dream a reality.
We work with candidates to determine if their dreams are aligned with what your brand can predictably deliver. If there's a match, we help them understand what it takes to win within your brand and help them ensure they are properly resourced to achieve their goals.We take a data-driven approach to managing recruitment pipelines, using consistent processes and marketing automation at each stage of the journey. This helps us spot opportunities to refine our tactics, create additional resources, and improve performance.
For a brand with a lot of first-time business owners, this might mean creating an eBook specifically catering to their concerns.
For a brand focused on converting existing business owners or attracting multi-unit franchisees, this could mean setting up a Q&A with the president or CEO so high-value franchisees can access the leadership team earlier in the sales process.

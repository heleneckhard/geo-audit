Lessons in Client Loyalty at Q2 CampEver notice how great comedians don't just make you laugh once—they keep you coming back show after show? There's something about perfect delivery and genuine connections that transforms a casual viewer into a devoted fan. At Wonderist's Q2 Camp, we explored this same magic, but with a twist: how to apply it to our client relationships.
 
Back to BlogNo items found.X min readWith our office transformed into a comedy club and our minds open to new possibilities, we discovered the striking parallels between stand-up success and client loyalty. Armed with punchlines, prop comedy, and perfectly-timed pauses, we transformed our quarterly meeting into a masterclass on the art of turning satisfied clients into total super fans. This wasn't just another day at the office; it was a front-row seat to valuable lessons that highlight the key elements that great comedy and client relationships share: timing, authenticity, and the courage to go beyond the expected.Setting the StageWalking into Wonderist for Q2 Camp, we entered a world of comedy and theater. Microphones were scattered throughout the space, mock Academy Awards gleamed from shelves, and our Office Culture Manager Sarah fully committed to the theme, appearing as Megan from ""Bridesmaids""—neck pillow and all.As Buds grabbed coffee and breakfast, the buzz of conversation mingled with laughter. The stage wasn't just set metaphorically—our training room had been transformed into a proper theater, complete with a spotlight and comedy club atmosphere.Act I: Recapping the FoundationBefore diving into new material, our trusted professional development facilitators, the Ketterblairs, helped us refresh our memory of Module 1's key skills that we've been implementing since our last Camp:Demonstrating trust-building strategies with clientsEncouraging healthy debate (safe conflict)Establishing and revisiting commitmentsMaintaining high levels of accountabilityKeeping focus on resultsThese five principles have transformed how we interact with clients over the past few quarters. But just like in comedy, once you've nailed your first big performance, the audience expects even more from your follow-up act.Act II: The Loyalty Equation""Who likes Starbucks?"" was the seemingly simple question that kicked off our deep dive into client loyalty. Hands shot up around the room as Buds shared what keeps them coming back: the consistent taste whether you're in San Diego or Seattle, the familiar ambience with comfortable seating and soft background music, and the reliability of finding one on nearly every corner. The Ketterblairs nodded knowingly, using this familiar example to introduce us to the Loyalty Equation:Consistent Positive Experiences + Emotional Engagement - Cost = LoyaltyBreaking into small groups, we spent 30 minutes analyzing various client scenarios and applying the Loyalty Equation to each situation. We discovered that consistency alone isn't enough—clients need to feel emotionally connected to our brand to move from being occasional audience members to becoming devoted fans of the Wonderist show.Act III: Interpersonal Skill WorkshopArmed with new understanding of the loyalty concept, we broke into groups to practice specific skills that build emotional engagement with clients:Recognizing clients as individualsSharing opinions effectivelyUnderstanding others' goalsThe Ketterblairs introduced five simple strategies to implement these skills, which we immediately put into practice through drills—quick role-playing exercises that simulated real client interactions. These drills were both enlightening and entertaining, creating plenty of laughs as we worked to refine our approaches.The Grand Finale: Recognizing & Exceeding ExpectationsFor the final act of our day, we worked in medium-sized groups and were handed sealed envelopes containing brief client situations. Each group was challenged to identify specific ways we could showcase improvements for these clients—moving beyond meeting expectations to exceeding them.As we tore open the envelopes, we found scenarios ranging from a dental practice seeing slow website traffic growth to a client frustrated with their social media engagement. Rather than simply addressing the stated concerns, we dug deeper to find opportunities to go above and beyond.Through these exercises, we developed concrete strategies for:Making the first 90 days with a new client exceptional""Over-delivering"" in meaningful ways that build loyaltyTransforming satisfied clients into passionate Wonderist brand championsThe After-Party: National Comedy TheatreIn the spirit of our theme, we concluded our day with a trip to the National Comedy Theatre, where a group of sketch comedians had us in stitches. The evening took an unexpected turn when several Buds were invited to participate in the sketches!‍From team members spontaneously dancing when certain trigger words were spoken to others creating freeze-frame human sculptures and providing hilarious sound effects for scenes, our team showed that we don't just talk about engagement—we live it.Takeaways from the TeamAs we left the theatre, the connections between comedy and client relations became clear. Both require:Perfect timingReading the roomMaking authentic connectionsGoing beyond the expectedCreating memorable momentsJust as masterful comedians build a dedicated following that eagerly awaits their next performance, we at Wonderist are focusing on building deeper connections with our clients. We want to move beyond simply delivering good service to creating relationships where clients genuinely look forward to working with us and enthusiastically recommend us to others. By implementing the Loyalty Equation in our daily interactions and consistently exceeding expectations, we're setting the stage for even stronger client relationships in Q3.After all, in both comedy and client relations, it's not just about getting a polite nod—it's about creating enthusiastic advocates who can't wait to tell others about their experience. And that's no joke!‍

Her life’s a blend of strategy and sun salutations, with a side of wagging tails and beach vibes!Client Success ManagerShelby WagnerOriginally from the stunning mountains of Colorado, Shelby moved to sunny San Diego during COVID and never looked back. A true marketing aficionado, she combines her extensive experience in SaaS sales and digital marketing with a passion for crafting compelling campaigns. Excited to bring her creative sparkle to Wanderist, Shelby thrives on new adventures. When she's not innovating marketing strategies, she’s living it up at concerts, floating in the bay, exploring trendy restaurants, and soaking up beach vibes with her husky, Malo. Balancing hard work with fun, Shelby is all about making life and work fabulous!Senior Social Media ManagerBrynn BurninghamBrynn was raised in San Diego and recently returned after spending the past few years in Los Angeles. With experience across industries including dentistry, health and wellness, fashion, and tech, she loves helping businesses build real, lasting connections with their communities through thoughtful social media strategy and content creation. Outside of work, you can find Brynn at a concert, trying new restaurants with friends, or at a workout class. Senior Project ManagerElla MurrayAdding another Midwesterner to the roster, Ella is originally from Michigan and now calls San Diego home. With a passion for exploring new restaurants—from dive bar to five-star—she’s always up for a culinary adventure. Ella enjoys hosting parties where you’ll find her behind the bar or DJ booth. She has a friendly competitive nature and loves a challenge in anything from golf to ping pong to arcade basketball. Outside of work, Ella walks dogs for a side hustle and is a proud plant mom.Graphic DesignerGrace LindemannA Tahoe native, Grace moved to Bozeman, MT, to attend Montana State University where she graduated with a major in Fine Arts and a minor in powder skiing. Post-college, she worked as an in-house designer for a Tahoe-based marketing agency until the magnetic pull toward the ocean became unbearable. Now she’s happily settled in San Diego where she tidepools, surfs, rides her bike on the beach, and boasts of never missing a killer sunset. Grace loves graphic design and, though a self-proclaimed introvert, will gladly discuss Gestalt principles or color theory for as long as you care to listen.Senior Client Success ManagerMarc CoppolaMarc was born and raised in Buffalo, NY (Go Bills!), where he still resides with his wife, daughter, dog and two cats. Marc has a history of client facing roles, including Project Manager, Platform Success, Support Management and Sr. Leadership. He loves problem solving and stretching the idea of what is possible. When he’s not working and chasing around his household, you can usually find him with his guitar or camera in his hands.Photo/Video SpecialistTatiana SukhorukovaTatiana has been telling stories through a lens since childhood — creating simple animations at 9, getting her first camera at 12, and by 14 earning her first paycheck as a school photographer and videographer. She graduated with highest honors in Arts & Cultural Management, a program that blended marketing, business organization, event planning, and stage directing. Over the years, Tatiana has created content for small businesses, exhibitions, and events. Outside of work, she’s an animal lover, a fitness enthusiast who finds inspiration in solo workouts by the ocean, and a music fan with a playlist that ranges from classical to rock to pop. Client Success ManagerLauren RossiLauren was born and raised in Northern California and slowly made her way down the California coast after high school. She graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a BA in Advertising and a minor in Graphic Design. Upon graduation, Lauren relocated to San Diego, where she planted deep roots. Outside of work, Lauren teaches hot yoga and you can catch her snowboarding Mammoth on the weekends. Her golden retriever, Cooper, is the light of her life, and he goes everywhere with his mom. Lauren is a huge SF GIants fan and she loves when they come to town so she can watch them beat the Padres. Fun fact: Lauren packed up her car and road tripped to Austin, TX, and she ended up staying for over 2 years. As much as she loved the queso, she’s happy to be back in San Diego. Project ManagerTaylor GornishBorn and raised in Encinitas, CA, Taylor is a true West Coast girl through and through. After earning her degree in Psychology from Chico State and diving into a Master’s program in Integrative Nutrition, she explored a variety of industries - from wellness and mental health to retail advertising - before landing as a Project Manager at Wonderist. Outside the office, you’ll find her reading, checking out new restaurants, flowing through a hot yoga class, or soaking up the sun on long walks with her dog Gus.Marketing Funnel SpecialistMarisa RomeroMarisa grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, while spending summers with her grandparents in New York. In 2021, she moved to San Diego for the perfect weather while finishing her degree at UNM, and balancing a full-time job. After graduating, she dove into marketing, building email, social, and affiliate programs, among others. At Wonderist, she’s hit the ground running, optimizing & turning strategy into measurable results. Off the clock, Marisa spends time with her girlfriend and their Goldendoodle, Hazel. You’ll find her scouting for the best iced matcha, wandering farmers' markets, hitting hot pilates, and curating a capsule wardrobe. Her glass skin speaks for itself, and yes, she’ll share her routine.CopywriterFianna AttishaAs a native San Diegan and USD alumna, Fianna is of course a die-hard Padres and SDFC fangirl. With a blended background spanning tech and women’s health, Fianna has worked as a copywriter and ghostwriter with brands and C-suite leaders featured in outlets such as Forbes and Time Magazine. She now brings that unique perspective to her work as a Wonderist copywriter – when she’s not [slowly] running or baking up some [delicious] cinnamon rolls.Client Success ManagerBrad RodmanBrad, a Northern California native, brings a unique perspective shaped by early exposure to the dental industry. His mom was a dental assistant, and his first job was writing reminder cards for the entire practice (a 6th grade summer to remember!). He earned a degree from Santa Clara, focusing on behavioral finance, which sparked his love for marketing. With a background in Marketing and Social Media SaaS, Brad is dedicated to helping clients achieve their desired outcomes. A San Diego resident since 2018, you'll find him chasing birdies at Torrey Pines or playing fetch with his dog Pip at the beach.Client Success ManagerAlex CondosAlex is a San Diego native and graduated from the University of Colorado Denver, where she established a strong foundation for her career in marketing. She launched her Marketing career in the real estate sector with Compass before transitioning into agency work as an Account Manager, where she partnered with clients across diverse industries. Over the course of her career, Alex has developed expertise in client management and SEO, leveraging both analytical precision and creative strategy to deliver measurable results. In her current role as Client Success Manager at Wonderist, she is dedicated to building lasting client relationships, aligning strategies with business objectives, and driving success through innovative marketing solutions. Beyond her professional pursuits, Alex maintains an active lifestyle, with a lifelong passion for sports including soccer, tennis and weight lifting. Client Success ManagerMichelle ""MC"" ChukwujekwuOriginally from Texas, Michelle left everything she knew and moved to sunny San Diego for the sake of adventure. With experience as an entrepreneur in the health and wellness space and a background in advertising, she knows what it takes to grow a business. Now at Wonderist, she brings that same energy, empathy, and hustle to help her clients shine. In her free time, you’ll find her traveling, hitting the gym, playing pickleball, or on a never-ending quest to taste the world’s best cinnamon roll!‍Marketing Funnel SpecialistBen WieboldtOriginally from Dallas, Ben moved to San Diego to earn his Marketing degree at SDSU and quickly embraced the city’s coastal lifestyle. After building experience in real estate marketing, he joined Wonderist, where he brings both creativity and strategy to help clients connect with new patients. When he’s not working, Ben is making the most of the San Diego lifestyle - golfing, surfing, hiking, or catching a Padres game. A lifelong sports fan and coffee enthusiast, he’s always up for exploring something new in his adopted hometown.‍Senior Social Media ManagerKelly HolmstromMeet Kelly, the social media strategist who believes great marketing, like great service, is all about the experience. Her background in hospitality marketing taught her the fine art of connecting with people, and now she uses that superpower at Wonderist Agency to craft patient-winning social media campaigns. Based in Seattle, Kelly is constantly tracking trends to make sure our clients always look fresh, eye-catching, and completely authentic online. When she's not driving engagement, Kelly is likely out exploring Seattle's restaurant scene, hitting the gym, or compiling the next perfect playlist. The best part of her day? Coming home to two very loved (and very spoiled) cats who consider the couch their kingdom.Client Success ManagerMitchell PowersA San Diego native with a passion for digital marketing, Mitchell has been consulting dental practices on their online marketing strategies since he graduated from San Diego State University with a B.S. in Business Management. After a brief stint in Seattle, Mitchell is excited to return to his hometown. When he’s not helping dental practices succeed online, Mitchell can be found exploring new restaurants, gaming, or trying a new recipe.WonderpupsKaylee's pupMaxMadison's pupSukiAmandine's pupMiloLauren's pupPalomaSarah's pupPaceKarisa's pupArchieLucy's pupEvieJenn's pupReggieRyan's pupDexterEmma's pupBrodyLaura & Michael's pupGidgetGarrett's pupFinnWant to be the next Wonder Bud?Join Our TeamWhat are we buzzing about?

What’s a New Dental Patient Really Worth? (It’s More Than You Think)By Michael Anderson, Co-Founder at Wonderist Agency
 
Back to BlogNo items found.X min readIf you asked 100 dentists what a new patient is worth, most would rattle off a number based on that first cleaning and maybe a few x-rays. At best, they might think in terms of first-year revenue. But what if I told you the real value of that patient — could be $10,000, $20,000, or even more?At Wonderist, we’ve helped over 1,000 dental practices grow, and I can tell you with confidence: a new patient isn’t just a one-time transaction — they’re a long-term relationship that can be very valubale. Especially when you factor in referrals.Let’s break that down.‍📈 Understanding Lifetime Value (LTV)At its most basic, Lifetime Value (LTV) measures how much collections a patient brings in over the full length of their relationship with your practice. For a general patient who visits twice a year and stays for 7–8 years, that’s around $4,000.If they accept a few elective treatments — say, whitening or aligners — it climbs to $7,000 or more. And if they come to you for implants or cosmetic work? Now you’re talking $20,000 to $30,000+ in lifetime value.Here’s a breakdown by patient type:‍💰 Direct Lifetime Value by Patient Type (8-Year Avg)
  
    
      
        
          Patient Type
          Annual Revenue
          Upsell Potential
          Direct LTV (No Referrals)
        
      
      
        
          Baseline
          $500
          None
          $4,000
        
        
          Engaged General
          $650
          $1,800 (e.g. whitening, ortho)
          $7,000
        
        
          Cosmetic/Implant
          $1,000+
          $10K–$25K (e.g. implants)
          $18,000–$33,000
        
      
    
  ‍🔁 Don’t Forget Referrals (That’s Where It Gets Interesting)Most dentists underestimate the ripple effect of a great patient experience. When you wow someone — with your care, your communication, your office environment — they talk. And more importantly, they refer.Here’s what the data shows:A happy patient refers 1–2 people on averageMany referrals are family-based, not just individualsThese referrals often bring just as much value over time
‍We updated our model to reflect this, using a weighted average of 1.6 patients per referral.‍🔁 Referral-Adjusted Patient Value (Household Impact)

          $4,000
          $640
          $6,400
          $10,400
        
        
          Engaged General
          $7,000
          $1,560
          $8,000
          $15,000
        
        
          Cosmetic/Implant
          $25,000
          $4,800
          $12,800
          $37,800
        
      
    
  ‍💡 So What Do You Do With This?Here’s what this should shift for you:Raise your bar on the first visit. Every new patient could be worth $30K. Treat them accordingly.‍Invest in experience, not just marketing. Marketing gets them in the door. Experience makes them stay — and refer.Track referrals, not just leads. A Google Ads lead might cost you $150. But if that lead brings in a family of four, your true cost per acquisition is a fraction of that.
Final ThoughtAt Wonderist, we believe growth isn’t just about filling chairs — it’s about building momentum. That starts by understanding the true value of every new patient. Not just what they spend — but who they bring with them.If you’re ready to rethink what marketing success looks like in your practice, we’d love to talk.– Michael Anderson

Frequently Asked QuestionsHave More Questions?Reach Out For PricingWhy 60 minutes?60 minutes is enough time for our team to capture content that covers 4 months of your campaigns and deliverables. Your first interview will be 90 minutes so we can help you with technical set up and troubleshooting, answer any questions you may have about the process, and coach you to feel comfortable in front of the camera. Once you're a pro, we'll reduce interview time for recurring sessions.How long will it take for my videos to go live in my marketing channels?Typically, it will take 4 weeks post Service Kickoff Call for your video content to go live in your deliverables and marketing campaigns. This time frame aligns with the build phase of our marketing services that we outline with you during the kickoff call. Can I reschedule my interview?We understand that things come up. Urgent matters, emergencies, and illness can and should be priorities. We want you feeling your best and to be in the best head space when we conduct your interview. Good moods lead to good content! We simply ask that you be communicative and proactive when requesting to reschedule. Our time is just as valuable as yours and no-showing will not be acceptable.What if I don't like my videos?We make every effort to make you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and will instruct you to do more takes until you sound natural. But sometimes clients need to see themselves before they can apply the feedback. That’s why each client is given ONE free pass to redo their first interview if they don’t like their content. Keep in mind, scheduling an additional interview will result in delays to your video content going live and ultimately moving the needle on your campaigns.Wonderist Agency has helped countless practices increase their new patient numbers and thrive with cohesive dental marketing strategies.Delivering the best dental marketing, with a smile.NavigateAbout UsDental Marketing ServicesOur TeamCareersSuccess StoriesBlogContact UsPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell or Share My Personal InformationContactcontact@wonderistagency.com(619) 291-70733015 St. Charles St. Suite B

The result is a one-of-a-kind brand that looks inviting and chic — a perfect match for Dr. Ullery’s culture and personality!Dr. Sahar UlleryCenterville, OHbranding, IRLRed Rock DentalDid you know that there are rare red rock formations in Medicine Hat, Canada? Neither did the Wonderist team, until we got to know Dr. Gibb and Dr. Kay over the course of their practice naming and branding package. Both doctors share a deep love for the natural beauty in their backyard and the people they plan to serve for decades to come. By fusing earth tones and national park aesthetics into their new brand, “Red Rock Dental” sends a nod to the outdoors while “Modern Care | Local Roots” touches on their commitment to quality community care.Dr. Gibb & Dr. KayMedicine Hat, Albertabranding, IRLSky Pediatric DentistryLetting healthy habits take flight and soar is the mission for the Sky Pediatric Dentistry team!

She came to Wonderist looking for a brand that would reflect her warm yet elevated practice culture.

Wait, what are paid ads for dentists?At Wonderist, we focus on two types of paid ads for dental practices: Google Ads and Social Ads. These powerful tools target potential patients at the point of decision.Dental Google Ads (PPC)Also known as ""pay per click"" or ""PPC"", Google Ads put your dental practice in front of the right patients on search engines. Our team analyzes data from each online dental ad campaign to maximize your overall ROI and get the best bang for your buck.Social Ads for DentistsSocial Ads appear on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. We build targeted audiences and A/B test ads to reach the best demographic with the strongest message. Results are tracked in an easy-to-read reporting dashboard.Businesses make an average of $2 in revenue for every $1 spent on paid adsWhy are Google Ads important for my dental practice?Google Ads and Social Ads gives you the microphone to speak to people who are actively looking for you and your service. Think of it this way: SEO is like going to a bar, hoping that you’ll stand out among the crowd and find a fellow single friend. Paid ads is like paying for a dating app. Everyone is single and they are looking to connect! Leveraging both Google Ads and Social Ads boosts your chance of getting in front of the patients you’re looking for.  Our strategy for dental PPC successOur team focuses on two different types of Google Ads for dentists: Search Ads and Display Ads. Check out how we make the most of your Social Ads, too.Search AdsDisplay AdsSocial AdsSearch AdsWe buy ad space at the top of Google’s search results by bidding on targeted keywords that are likely to attract new patients. Most people never scroll past the first page of search engines, which means showing up at the top of search results is key.Boosts your visibilityTargets the exact patients you wantCost-effective way to reach potential patientsDisplay AdsThese are shown on websites that “rent out” space to Google to show affiliated ads. Our team most commonly uses display ads to remarket your website. For example, after a patient visits your website, they will be shown banner ads to remind them to return and make an appointment.Gently remind interested patients to book appointmentsIncrease awareness of your practiceSocial AdsThe power of social media ads lies in their ability to target specific audiences and build brand awareness, which increases the chances of converting them into new patients. These ads show up on Facebook and Instagram through a variety of formats, such as:ImageVideoCarouselWant to know what your dental ad words budget should be?We have a tool that uses census information and 10 years of historical ad words data to help you find the perfect budget for your dental practice.Check It OutWant to know what your ad words budget should be?We have a tool that uses census information and 10 years of historical ad words data to help you find the perfect budget for your practice.Google & Social Ads for DentistsHere’s what you can expectKeyword ResearchWe’ll identify the most relevant and high-performing keywords so we can target the patients that are already seeking a dentist like you.Landing Page DesignWe’ll craft beautiful landing pages that are designed to engage and convert interested users.Facebook Page SetupNo need to get in the weeds on Facebook — if you don’t have a practice page already, our team will build one out for you.Ad Account & Audience CreationOur team will build your Google and Social Ads accounts, curating specific audiences to set your campaigns up for success.OptimizationTo ensure the success of your campaigns, your Paid Ads Specialist will monitor their performance and make necessary adjustments along the way.The Wonderist Dental Ad Words ProcessStarter Google AdsGrowth Google AdsPremium Google Ads01Step OneKickoff CallYour Paid Ads Specialist will give suggestions for your 2 campaigns and propose an ad schedule and budget.

With paid ads, you can have patients already scheduled for appointments before you even open your doors.Practices Looking To Go Fee For ServiceGoing primarily fee for service means it’s time to market your practice to patients that are willing and interested to pay for care out of pocket.Practices Looking For New PatientsWhether you’re starting from scratch or are already an established practice, paid ads can help you get in front of patients actively looking for a new dentist in your area.Practices Focused On Emergency CarePatients struggling with dental trauma need to find care soon. Paid ads help you show up right away when they’re searching for a nearby emergency dentist.Established Practices Looking to Attract Speciality ProceduresWhen patients are searching for specific treatments and procedures such as All-on-X, dental implants, and clear aligners, paid ads help your practice show up for those keywords.Wonderist Ad Words PackagesA startup practice typically has different needs than an established practice, so we’ve created a variety of packages to best suit your specific goals.Google AdsSocial AdsService IncludedStarter AdsGrowth AdsPremium AdsManaged BudgetFrom $500 - $1,000 a monthFrom $1,000 - $3,000 a monthFrom $3,000+ a monthAd Campaigns2UP TO 10UNLIMITEDLanding Pages11324/7 Online DashboardIncluding full data visibilityPricingBilled MonthlyInterested?Get Pricing InfoService IncludedGrowth AdsPremium AdsAd CampaignsUP TO 3Social RemarketingDedicated Ad SpecialistPricingBilled MonthlyInterested?Get Pricing InfoDon’t take our word for it…“As a start-up I was very scared and worried if I made the right choice picking Wonderist as my marketing company.

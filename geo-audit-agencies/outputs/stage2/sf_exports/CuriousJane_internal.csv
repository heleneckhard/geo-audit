                The Challenge
                This quick-service dining brand, based in Kansas City, was known for their high-quality fresh subs and meals in the Midwest, but not elsewhere. They wanted to expand into new markets, but franchise development was difficult because of low brand awareness. They turned to Curious Jane to help them spread the word about the business opportunity they were offering.

Approach & insight



We knew that national PR could make new markets aware of Goodcents and generate interest in franchising. They were performing well in their existing markets, so we knew it was a great time to capitalize on their success and create stories that would drive visibility and inquiries. 











Strategy & Execution



We targeted thought leadership opportunities and created content or blogs, organic social media posts, news releases and placements on podcasts. We maintained a steady stream of good news about Goodcents nationwide that would be seen and heard by good franchisee candidates. 











The Results



Within the first year, we secured 46 placements with more than 42 million potential reach. We generated plenty of coverage in the Midwest, including several full articles in the Kansas City Business Journal. More importantly, we were able to secure placements in national restaurant trade publications and franchise publications, as well as a story in Inc. We positioned the Goodcents CEO as a thought leader, resulting in the CEO being quoted in a national restaurant management outlet, Modern Restaurant Management, and later doing a podcast interview with the editor of that magazine.   The coverage we generated led to a wave of interest. Within three years, Goodcents expanded into several new markets and two new states, Pennsylvania and Texas.

            Email Automation Turns Leads Into Long-Term Customers

        
                    
                            
        
        
            
                The Challenge
                Kumon needed an automated lead-nurturing strategy that would attract parents to their website, stay in touch with them and ultimately convince them to enroll their children in the Kumon Math and Reading Program. Once parents signed up, Kumon needed to ensure that they felt welcome, well informed and equipped to set their children up for success.

The Results
96.9%delivery rate



71%average open rate



12.68%click-through rate





All of our emails achieved (and exceeded!) the desired results. The commercial email sequence was particularly successful.











Approach & Insight



Curious Jane learned the many pain points of Kumon’s target parents. We discovered all the reasons they might hesitate to convert — the cost, unfamiliarity with the program, scheduling issues and so on. We also knew that these parents were extremely busy and needed to be able to quickly and easily access and review all the facts about Kumon. 



Strategy & Execution



We developed a series of informative emails for parents that focused on the value of Kumon. One email at a time, we answered parents’ most pressing questions: What is Kumon?

            The Beauty of Public Relations 
            A Scalable Approach Fuels Franchise Growth in Beauty and Wellness

        
                    
                            
        
        
            
                The Challenge
                WellBiz Brands has a portfolio of category-leading brands in the beauty and wellness sector: Drybar®, Amazing Lash Studio®, Elements Massage® and Radiant Waxing®. The sub-brands were all performing well, but WellBiz Brands wanted to take their franchise development efforts to the next level. They needed to increase awareness of the franchising opportunity they offered and turned to Curious Jane for help with marketing and PR.

Approach & Insight



People don’t search for franchise opportunities with brands they don’t know or when they’re unaware that a business is a franchise. Curious Jane set out to build awareness of and credibility for all the sub-brands in WellBiz Brands’ portfolio and fuel interest in the franchise model. We focused our efforts on public relations, and we targeted franchise, business and industry-specific publications, as well as other media outlets that would reach potential franchisees. 











Strategy & Execution



We created monthly blogs to add fresh and relevant content to the website. We wrote press releases and articles that piqued interest and conveyed the WellBiz Brands opportunity. And we made organic social media posts that clearly communicated the benefits of the WellBiz Brands business model: predictable growth, recurring revenue, a scalable platform, thriving markets and an experienced leadership team.  















The Results



Within one year of launching our PR campaign, we had 62 placements with a potential reach of more than 102 million through our organic and earned content alone. Our placements included a piece about how WellBiz Brands recruits service providers that ran in the International Franchise Association’s magazine, Franchising World; local publications reporting Drybar multi-unit deals in New Jersey and Atlanta; franchisee profiles in Franchising Magazine USA; national rankings in Entrepreneur and reports on the surge in the self-care industry in trade outlets such as Beauty Industry Report and Massage Magazine.

Approach & Insight



The pandemic had made thorough sanitation and frequent cleaning more important to businesses than ever. We had an opportunity to highlight that priority — along with Office Pride’s commitment to delivering the highest-quality commercial cleaning.



Strategy & Execution



We put our public relations team of experienced former journalists on the Office Pride beat. They wrote and placed articles in B2B publications that would reach both potential customers and potential franchisees. We highlighted Office Pride’s long track record, solid reputation and excellent rankings and awards from organizations like Entrepreneur and Franchise Business Review.”

Approach & Insight



Curious Jane recognized a number of factors that we could use to Kumon’s advantage. They had not been doing much recruitment advertising, so we knew public relations could go a long way in raising awareness. Third-party stories about the Kumon brand and its franchising opportunities would be seen as newsworthy, trustworthy and compelling to potential franchisees.



We had plenty of positive news to share: A Kumon franchise offers its owner-operators personal fulfillment, freedom and flexibility. Kumon has the lowest franchise fee in their category and generous incentives. They’re the oldest company in their industry and the largest in the U.S., with 25,000 locations worldwide. Entrepreneur magazine has awarded Kumon several impressive rankings — including being a top low-cost franchise and a top global franchise.











Strategy



From our 20 years of franchise development experience, Curious Jane knew how important it is to demonstrate to prospects what their life could be like as a franchisee. So we decided to highlight real-life, passionate Kumon instructors and tell their stories, making the experience of owning a Kumon franchise feel relatable and appealing.



We made a plan: The experienced journalists on Curious Jane’s PR team would write and distribute articles to highlight Kumon’s strong reputation, ongoing accomplishments and excellent franchise opportunity. We would publish and push out monthly blogs. We committed to distributing news about all of Kumon’s awards, events and announcements to local, regional and national media sources. We would use native articles and organic content on LinkedIn to ensure that Kumon news always felt natural — never salesy.











Execution



We carried out our PR plan and kept the steady stream of good news about Kumon and its franchise opportunities flowing. As with all our public relations endeavors, we reported on every one of our tactics. And through this reporting, it was easy to see that every time one of our stories went live, it resulted in an immediate increase in inquiries and traffic to Kumon’s franchise development website.

            Rebranding a Legacy Ice Cream Franchise

        
                    
                            
        
        
            
                The Challenge
                Cream offers a variety of ice cream and fresh-baked sweet treats. Brothers Jimmy and Gus Shamieh opened their first store in Berkeley, California, centered on their mother’s scratch-made ice cream sandwiches. But once Cream grew and advanced to a franchise model, they turned to Curious Jane for strategic rebranding and a new website. They needed a well-functioning site that would convey a strong, distinctive brand and help their stores succeed in every market.

Approach & Insight



Everyone loves ice cream. It’s a classic indulgence that carries a strong nostalgia factor, since most of us started enjoying it as small children. Curious Jane wanted to tap into this universal, deep-seated fondness and make sure that when visitors landed on the Cream website, they would immediately be intrigued and tempted. We wanted to convey Cream’s playful, enthusiastic vibe as well as their super premium quality and delicious taste.



We knew that the Cream website experience had to be simple, straightforward and full of appetite appeal. We wanted to make it as enticing and delightful as a Cream treat.



Strategy & Execution



We chose an exciting, fresh brand palette for Cream centered on vibrant hues of raspberry, periwinkle and lemon. Friendly sans serif fonts helped convey a sense of simplicity and ease. And beautifully lit and styled product photography and video did the important work of whetting visitors’ appetites. We wrote copy to elicit the joy of choosing and indulging in a Cream creation, and we constructed the site to make it intuitive, quick and easy to access all the important information: menu items, flavors and store locations.

















The Results



Curious Jane met Cream’s need for a unique, user-friendly website to showcase and reinforce the new brand look we’d created. Through this inviting, dynamic, attractive site, visitors could quickly get a sense of everything Cream has to offer and find what they need to enjoy Cream offline.

                The Challenge
                Kumon sought us out to help them breathe new life into their brand at a critical time in the growth of the company. Competition with other education offerings was high, and they didn’t feel like their existing “Where smart kids get smarter” advertising resonated with parents. They wanted a more powerful, effective branding campaign.

The Results
46%Increase in Website Traffic



28%Increase in Parent Orientations



7%Increase in Enrollments





Approach & Insight



Our research revealed the main issue was lack of brand awareness. Kumon ads were difficult to distinguish from competitors’ ads, and even though the Kumon program was unique, the value proposition wasn’t clear. While competitors focus on short-term tutoring, Kumon is the opposite of a quick fix. Kumon builds mastery of skills through daily practice, and these skills translate into long-term life success. We arrived at a big insight: Moms and Kumon together can expand the possibilities for children.











Strategy



We looked closely at Kumon’s target audience (moms seeking a proven partner to help their children succeed) and identified two distinct customer personas we wanted to reach. We highlighted Kumon’s differentiator — their emphasis on practice — with a new, proprietary theme line: practice makes possibilities. We knew parents would understand this concept, kids would be inspired by it and franchisees would embrace it.

                The Challenge
                Office Pride wanted a more efficient and effective website approach. Each of their franchises was maintaining its own microsite, and because Office Pride doesn’t have exclusive territories, these microsites — more than 140 of them — were often trying to compete for local clients. Franchisees had to pay for SEO to try to boost their traffic.

+36%increase in average time spent on the page



+61.3%increase in page load time











Approach & Insight



Curious Jane knew we could help all Office Pride franchisees — as well as the overall Office Pride brand — by changing this setup. We proposed bringing all of the microsites under the corporate umbrella of officepride.com and converting each microsite to a location page.



Every franchise would be able to share customized content on their designated location page: a short bio of the owner, details on communities they served and a list of their service offerings. The blogs and other content that used to be replicated on microsites would now live on the central website, and corporate would pay for all SEO services.



These changes would not only increase overall traffic, but they would level the playing field for franchises located near one another. Franchisees would now be able to spend their ad budget on pay-per-click ads to direct leads to their franchise.











Strategy & Execution



Because we knew that users most frequently visited the Office Pride site from their phones, we designed a new mobile-first website streamlined to load quickly and improve the user experience.



We added location-based services that would promptly determine the three closest franchises to the user. The user would be prompted to choose one and then go straight to the customized location page.

WellBiz Brands saw a significant increase in their lead volume and quality. 











WellBiz Brands — the umbrella brand — and its range of franchising opportunities weren’t well known. Curious Jane set out to remedy that.



We wanted to promote WellBiz Brands as a parent brand and raise its visibility. This would enable us to build awareness and credibility for the four sub-brands and even cross-sell among them. And because all the brands live within the same beauty and wellness space, we could multiply the impact of our advertising, marketing and PR efforts.











Strategy & Execution



We created a brand strategy that led with WellBiz Brands, the umbrella brand and established its credibility at the top of the sales funnel. We used the better-known Drybar brand to elevate the other sub-brands. And we found out where WellBiz Brands’ ideal franchisee spends her time and planned out ads for Google and Meta to reach her.

Our comprehensive strategy for Kumon has yielded impressive results, enabling us to effectively reach and engage with the persona. We homed our creative content, optimized our paid media presence and built a strong reputation through PR efforts. By maintaining a consistent and compelling brand narrative, we captured the attention of our target audience, resulting in higher quality, ready-to-convert leads. As we move forward, our commitment to innovation and excellence remains steadfast, ensuring Kumon’s continued success in making a positive impact on children’s lives and communities.



Approach & Insight



After a thorough analysis of 1,600 franchisees, we found a common thread: passion. Kumon Instructors’ primary motive is to help the children in their communities succeed in math and reading. These instructors have experienced the Kumon Method firsthand and understand what a difference it can make for a child. Most instructors were either students themselves, had a child in Kumon or knew someone who used Kumon. We wanted to leverage their knowledge of and trust in the brand as we presented the opportunity for a fulfilling career.



In addition to its dedicated customer base, Kumon boasted a well-established history of success. With over six decades of implementing the Kumon Method, more than 26,000 centers worldwide and consistently ranking as a leading franchisor for over 20 years, Kumon has the experience and resources needed to increase their sales pipeline.











Strategy & Execution



After establishing a tailored persona for Kumon, we were able to determine what paid media platforms she uses, her key values, and what type of messaging and creative could resonate with her the most. While our approach for Kumon encompassed a wide variety of services, our primary emphasis revolved around creative content, paid media strategies and public relations efforts.



Creative Content



Our research unveiled a common trend among competitor brands and other franchisors in the children’s education industry – their design elements all bore striking similarities. This not only made it difficult to distinguish one brand from another but also led some to appear more as consumer-focused ads rather than franchise development. We saw this as an opportunity to redefine Kumon’s creative approach. Our aim was not only to convey sophistication and underscore the gravity of the opportunity but also to distinguish ourselves from the competition.



To achieve this, we implemented quarterly refreshes, meticulously analyzing elements such as color schemes, models, fonts, CTAs (Calls to Action), headlines and post copy to identify what generated the highest click-through rates. These refreshes served a dual purpose – they prevented Kumon’s persona from growing weary of seeing the same advertisements while ensuring that Kumon remained at the forefront of its audience’s mind.



As our competitors started to emulate our approach, we viewed it as a flattering acknowledgment of our success, but it also motivated us to continually innovate and devise fresh ideas to maintain our distinct position in the market. By observing a 10% rise in the click rates of our ads, we obtained confirmation that the content we were producing had become more compelling.



















Paid Media



The first step was to establish Kumon’s brand presence on paid media platforms; this allows the brand to stay credible and at the top of people’s minds. Through the content presented on the platforms, we wanted to convey Kumon’s key messages:




Kumon is the No. 1 education franchise in North America.  



The persistent education gap means more families need supplemental education and tutoring services than ever before.  



Kumon is a low-cost franchise opportunity whose proven program and strong reputation allow instructors to build a profitable business that makes a difference in the lives of children and in communities. 



Teachers who are passionate about education but tired of the bureaucracy in schools are well equipped to become Kumon Instructors, and Kumon will train them on the aspects of business ownership that they don’t already know. 




We meticulously tracked leads at every stage of the sales funnel to assess the effectiveness of various creative elements, messaging, platforms and campaign types to identify which combination produced overall the highest volume of qualified leads. Through testing and optimizations, we refined our strategy to find the best balance that caters to the preferences of the persona and the needs of Kumon.











Public Relations



Investing in a franchise is a significant decision that demands careful consideration. While we recognized the credibility of the Kumon business, our challenge was effectively conveying this to individuals who were just getting acquainted with the brand. To bridge this gap, we embarked on an extensive PR campaign to ensure that as Kumon’s persona conducted research, she could establish a stronger connection with the Kumon brand and develop a sense of trust in it.



Our PR team worked closely with Kumon to develop click-worthy content year-round. Through strong relationships with well-known publishers, we were able to get the Kumon brand on established media platforms such as Entrepreneur, FranchiseWire and MSNMoney.



By being able to control the narrative through PR efforts, Kumon was able to shape their own reputation, highlighting the mission they are on to help change the lives of children and positively impact communities. By creating a buzz and maintaining a consistent presence, Kumon established a strong awareness in the minds of their target audience. This resulted in higher quality and more buy-ready leads.

Approach & Insight



Curious Jane began by focusing on Kumon’s target persona — a busy mom needing a reliable partner to help her improve her children’s abilities and get them on the road to academic success. This mom is concerned, discerning and committed to doing right by her kids. 



After building the ideal persona, we conducted extensive research to refine her advertising journey through awareness, consideration and decision. We met her where she lived and wherever she sought parenting and education solutions. 

































Strategy & Execution



Curious Jane completely revamped Kumon’s media strategy. We targeted the ideal Kumon customer across multiple platforms in all stages of her buying journey. We crafted a holistic strategy to make the most of Kumon’s advertising budget and drive the best response. We used radio, TV and display advertising to build awareness and social media and search advertising to encourage moms to book a free assessment. Through retargeting ads, we transformed the brand familiarity and interest we’d built into actual conversions.

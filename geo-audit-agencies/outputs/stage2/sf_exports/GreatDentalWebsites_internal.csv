      Dental Websites That Actually Work
Built for Practice Growth. Run by People Who Care.
    
    
  
















  
    
      GDW started in 2007 when our founder, Jeff, built a website for his dad’s dental practice. He wasn't trying to launch a software company;  he was just helping out. It worked so well that 900 additional dentists have asked for the same thing. 
We specialize in dental websites that deliver results, and back them up with fast, personal support—no outsourced call centers—just real people who know your practice and want to see it grow.

When new dental website templates launch, you can switch anytime, without starting from scratch and spending thousands on a redesign. 
You're in control of your site, your content, and your design. We don't require a contract because we believe in earning your loyalty. You won't find hidden fees—just a smarter, more affordable way to keep your website working for you.

        In dentistry we often run into the “dental tax,” where the cost of a good or service seems to be magnified due just to our profession. Thankfully, my experience with GDW goes entirely counter to this.  The team at GDW, especially Scott Yoder, have given me sound advice always and after getting to know my style, have tailored my experience with them even when it did not help their bottom line.

        We have had an absolutely fantastic experience working with Great Dental Websites.  After both interviewing and working exclusively with other companies, I can safely say Great Dental Websites approaches everything they do with a positivity and professionalism that is unmatched.

        I have been working with the team at Great Dental Websites for over 10 yrs. I have been very happy with all the help they have provided for setting up my website for my dental office and maintaining it too. For the past few years I have worked with both Chaz and Kayt and they have provided the guidance that I have needed to keep my website at the top in my area.

              More Patients. Fewer Surprises
When patients search online, SEO determines who shows up. We make sure it's you. We don't assign your SEO and GEO to one person and hope for the best. If your rankings or traffic drop, the entire team works on a solution. We have technical specialists who fine-tune your site, content experts who study what drives patient inquiries, and strategists who stay on top of how AI is changing search, keeping your practice ahead. We meet weekly to share what's working and apply it across our campaigns. We work with dentists in busy cities and small towns, so we know what works for each market. We stay on top of every change in SEO and GEO so you don't have to. We build our strategy around one goal: getting you more patients.

              Compelling Copy to Attract Patients
We have real writers, not bots. Our copywriters don't just research dental topics; they are complete dental nerds who enjoy crafting content that speaks your patients’ language while hitting the SEO mark. Our writers collaborate with designers and strategists to keep your messaging consistent. Years of dental marketing experience plus relentless learning keep our writing team ahead of what's next, including smart AI integration to support the writing process rather than replace it.

              Whether you're new to town, adding an associate, or just want to bring in more high-value cases, a direct mail campaign can help drive the right patients through your doors. Direct mailers are built to be effective—targeting specific zip codes or neighborhoods near your practice.

          Reach Local Patients Directly
Not every potential patient is Googling “dentist near me.” Some may be new to the area, while others may be unhappy with their current provider, or they may simply prefer communicating the old-fashioned way. A well-designed mailer delivered right to their door can catch their eye at the right time—and make it easy to take action.

          Expand Beyond Your Online Visibility
Even with a strong website, great SEO, and a competitive Google Ads strategy, there are always parts of town where your practice might not rank well, or at all.
Want to target higher-income neighborhoods? Focus on families? Promote a specific offer in one part of town? With zip code and mail route targeting, we can help you hone in on the areas that matter most to your growth, even if you’re not yet visible online in those locations.
        
        
      
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        

  
  


        
      
    
  



















Dental Mailers—Done for You
GDW’s goal with this new service is to eliminate the guesswork from dental direct mail. Just pick a template, choose a neighborhood, and select your patient special; we’ll handle the rest (yes, even licking the envelopes).
Here’s how it works:





















    

  
    
    
      
        
          
          
            
              Pick Your Campaign
Choose from a semi-custom or fully custom mailer design. We’ll help you select the right option based on your goals, budget, and timeline. You’ll also choose the neighborhoods or zip codes you want to target.
            
            
          
        

        
          
        
      
    
      
        
          
          
            
              Design, Approve & Print
We’ll design your postcard—either using a template or creating a custom layout and message from scratch. You’ll review and approve the final version before we send it to print.
            
            
          
        

        
          
        
      
    
      
        
          
          
            
              Deliver & Track Results
Your mailers are printed and sent directly to your target zip code through our mailing partners. As your campaign runs, every call and online lead is tracked using custom phone numbers, QR Codes, or landing page analytics.

          Our Words Are Worth Smiling About
At GDW, we believe that your practice's story is as unique as the smiles you create. Our approach is personal. We assign a writer who will interview you and ask specific questions about your practice style, philosophy, messaging, and specifics about your services. Your writer becomes your voice, weaving your practice’s values, ethos, and expertise into a compelling narrative. This personal touch means content that truly resonates with your patients, telling them that you are more than just a tooth scrubber—you are a part of their healthcare and wellness journey.

              Why are there so many words on my website?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Creating quality, original content is integral to search engine optimization – ranking higher for your area in specific searches. By providing a large amount of custom content, we are actually giving you an edge against your competitors. Many marketing companies recycle used content instead of creating new content, but Google and other search engines know the difference. We run all of our content through a plagiarism checker to ensure that your content is 100% original – every time. 

Once your site goes live, you own your content and can alter or add to it anytime. Our copywriters write specifically for you. Not only will your content help you rank higher in searches, but it will also provide helpful information for your patients. Your new website will reflect your personal voice and practice philosophy and help people gain trust in you before you even meet! Our professional writers are trained to deliver dental copy with professionalism and accuracy, and you will have a chance to review all of it before your site goes live.
          
        
          
            
              
              If I decide to write my own content at first, can I change my mind halfway through?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Absolutely! No one will FORCE you to write your own copy, even if it sounded like a great idea in the beginning! This happens all the time. Dentists want to give it a shot and write their own content. And it makes sense. After all, you know your practice better than anyone, right? But when your schedule starts to overflow with heavy production, and you can’t scrape together five minutes just to fill out lab slips and shove some lunch into your face, writing 10,000+ words of website content can start to feel pretty overwhelming. We are still here for you. 

Our writers can pick up where you left off. Additionally, we will write to match your voice so that your site sounds seamless. At Great Dental Websites, we work with dentists to achieve your goals. Because we intimately understand the challenges dental practices face, we remain flexible, making your needs our top priority. After we begin the process of creating your new website, we will be in constant contact with you, asking for feedback and checking in. Because your online marketing is a reflection of you, your input is essential. You can add services once you see the smooth, swift, streamlined services we provide! We know you will be impressed with the final product.
          
        
          
            
              
              Do I have to pay monthly, or can I just pay for an occasional blog when I need it?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Whatever works best for you! Some of our clients write most of their blogs but need us to help them out from time to time. Others prefer that we maintain a consistent flow on their blogs and they write their own as time allows. Most clients find they don't have the time for consistent writing and ask us to maintain a steady flow of SEO-rich content month after month.
          
        
          
            
              
              Do patients actually read blogs?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            If you lead them to it. You can tag the blogs to the corresponding service or post them on social media for people to see them. Most patients will just skim them, but if it's something interesting, they may spend more time on them. And even if the patients aren't reading the more service-related blogs, search engines sure are. So whether patients read your blogs or not, they contribute to driving patients to your site and hopefully) into your treatment rooms.

              We identify and expertly use dental SEO strategies that empower your dental website and practice to rise to the top of the search results page when potential patients use Google and other search engines to find a new dentist. We focus on ethical dental Search Engine Optimization techniques that give you long-term results instead of so-called “black hat” techniques that can cause short-term gain but have potential long-term consequences.

Our skilled team will use their knowledge combined with the most up-to-date search engine information and algorithms to provide you with the highest level of initial success possible. Proper SEO takes time. As you have probably noticed, the internet changes constantly. New sites are added and optimized, and new dentists move into your area. They are all vying for the coveted number one search slot for the most popular searches in your area. How will you monitor and keep up with these changes?

By collecting data for your area, evaluating your options, and making regular adjustments, we can keep you climbing the search engine ladder and on top of the requirements of Google and other search engines so that your SEO never becomes obsolete. When you opt for ongoing SEO services, you have a dedicated team of experts working on your side to ensure that your ideal patient is able to find you in the complex web of internet searches.
          
        
          
            
              
              Can you give me an ""SEO Guarantee""?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            No, and to be perfectly frank, any ethical online marketing firm should be telling you the same thing. Google is a third party that no one, including us, has direct control over, and thus a guarantee is impossible. Some companies will make the guarantee another way. They’ll let you off the hook for payment unless they “get you on the first page.” Some SEO companies will technically win their part of the deal by getting on the first page for non-competitive terms with little visitor traffic instead of the higher traffic search terms that would actually lead to you getting lots of new patients
We believe in aligning your economic interests with ours. We have a long track record and as many referrals as you’d like to call, so you can be sure we will do the work the way we describe. And we have no contracts, so if we don’t perform, you can dump us. But beware of companies offering you “guarantees.” Chances are that you’re either being overcharged to account for this, or what they are willing to guarantee may not get you many new patients – which is the whole point of your website and SEO, right?

      Websites Made Specifically for Dentists
    
    
    
      
        Most practices re-do their websites every few years. The process is long and expensive, from choosing a new company to going through the website buildout process.

But it doesn't have to be. GDW built software that is updated on a regular basis so your website never becomes outdated. If Google announces a major change to its requirements, we will adjust our software and push it out to all sites at no additional cost.

                Sometimes, you need something that was created just for you. With a custom design, you can have just that. You’ll be able to give feedback and combine or eliminate certain elements to create the website you’re looking for.

                When opting for a semi-custom design, you gain the flexibility to select a pre-existing template and tailor it to suit your specific needs. Semi-custom designs are ideal for practices who are operating within limited budgets, but still want a custom look to match their branding.

            A lot of thought goes into each change. Some are required to stay up to date with changes in websites or dentistry, while others are more open to ideas and input. We take suggestions from our team and clients to make changes that benefit all of our clients. You can learn more about the process by watching our video about platform development.



          
        
          
            
              
              Can I easily update my website myself?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Yes! Our software is easy for anyone to update, even if you’ve never created or updated a website before. In fact, most of our customers have never touched a website before working with us. Every one of our customers receives:

Our “Crash Course Training” – We’ll share our screen with you and show you how to make changes to the site and add content.
Free unlimited training – Stuck? Call us, and we’ll share our screen and walk you through the problem until you feel confident.
Free unlimited support – Completely stuck?! Contact us, and we’ll take care of it for you!

Additionally, our clients commonly suggest new features. We usually add the feature to our platform, which means you get it, too—for free!

          A Flexible and Collaborative Agency
From our early days, we’ve worked hard to build a team of creative, hard-working, and intelligent professionals to help grow our clients’ practices. Some of our team started right out of college (or even as interns while still in college) and others joined us further along in their careers, giving us a mix of fresh points of views and perspectives as well as a wealth of experience and knowledge.

          Dental Marketing That Actually Works
We get it — you didn’t get into dentistry to spend your precious free time marketing your practice and attracting new patients. That’s not what you do best, and frankly, your time is better spent providing excellent dental care to your community. 

But that doesn’t make your practice’s marketing any less important! If you want to get in front of your community and turn website visitors into patients, it’s time for a strategic, holistic approach to dental marketing.

          It Matters How You Market Your Practice
You're likely not the only dental practice in your market. In most cases, you’re probably one of many, sometimes one of dozens of practices. How you market yourself can be the difference between surviving and thriving.
Great dental marketing differs from practice to practice, but at its core, it’s all about making your practice visible and creating genuine relationships with your community. Your ability to relate to people in your community directly impacts whether or not your practice will compete with others in the area.

              Reviews influence how patients choose a provider, how Google ranks your practice, and even whether someone clicks on your website or keeps scrolling. But staying on top of every review across every platform can quickly become a full-time job. That’s where our reputation management service comes in.

          Review Collection, Made Easy
We’ll automatically ask your patients for reviews using a custom post-appointment follow-up sequence via text and email. Whether they had a cleaning, a crown, or a consult, they’ll receive a message inviting them to leave feedback on Google, Facebook, or wherever matters most. 
Prefer to encourage reviews in person? We’ll help you create in-office QR codes to keep things simple for your team and your patients.

          Show Off Your Hard Work
Once the reviews start rolling in, we’ll put them to good use. Our review widgets make it easy to proudly display your best reviews right on your website. You can even filter them by keyword to highlight specific services, such as Invisalign, implants, or cosmetic dentistry, on your service pages. 
Want to use your reviews elsewhere? No problem. You can install as many widgets as you'd like across your site to match your marketing goals.

You get the benefits of responsiveness and engagement, without the extra work.

              What happens in the first call with my Marketing Coach?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            In your first meeting with your marketing coach, you will dive into your practice goals and current business and marketing baselines (be prepared to access your patient management software (PMS) for accurate numbers). We consider this meeting a ""discovery"" meeting to really understand you and your practice. From this meeting, we will develop a ""Practice Playbook"" unique to your business and goals to use as a basis for planning throughout the year. You will also be graded with a marketing baseline to see where we're starting from and to identify areas for improvement.
          
        
          
            
              
              What else is involved in these monthly or quarterly calls?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Our coaches don’t just provide advice but also assist you with uploading relevant, helpful content that supports your marketing mission. We help you keep on top of your content and make decisions about it. Will you gain the greatest benefit from adding testimonials, reviews, videos, service pages, Frequently Asked Questions, and blog posts, or should you focus on boosting your social media presence? Our team can review your performance and provide answers. 

Marketing coaching also allows us to keep you informed about changes in Google requirements that help you achieve higher rankings. Marketing coaching with Great Dental Websites will give you guidance, a strategy, and meaningful direction for keeping your site climbing the search engine ranks. 

Your feature video will last 2-3 minutes and will focus on what sets you apart and anything you feel your patients and potential patients should know about your dental office. Think about why people keep coming back to you year after year and why you decided to get into dentistry – let your personal story drive the direction of the video. We’ll add the intro, outro, music, and branding in post-production to make your video stand out.
          
        
          
            
              
              Why would I want quarterly calls instead of monthly calls?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            While monthly meetings may feel good, they do not always lead to the changes you wish to see in your practice. When times get busy, it’s easy to punt something to the following month. With 90-day meetings, you will have quarterly goals and executable action items that will help you make actual progress to grow your business. They also allow us to see trends clearly and pivot as necessary during each meeting. 

Some managed campaigns involve many more moving parts and may require monthly calls, but many practices will be best served with quarterly calls.

          Our Story
In 1999, my father, Dr. Mark Gladnick, asked me whether he needed to put his practice on “The Internet.” We launched his first dental website a month or two later, and it worked well for a long time. By late 2007, my dad’s website looked outdated. Since I had moved on with my career, my dad began reaching out to some for bids on what it would cost to update his website. 

It seemed outrageous to receive quotes approaching $35k for just a website – and this wasn’t even taking SEO or PPC marketing into account! I decided to rebuild his website for free. Almost immediately after starting development on my father’s new dental website, two of my uncles (also dentists) got wind of this and asked if I could make them websites, too.
        
        
      
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
                 
        
          
            


          
        
        
      
    
  






















An Idea Was Born: One Platform for All



Applying some of the techniques I had learned in Silicon Valley working on enterprise web applications, I came up with an idea: write one piece of software that would work for all three dental websites. We could customize each dental website with unique text, pictures, and so forth, but under the surface, everything would run on the same code.

At this point, a few of my uncles’ friends, who were also dentists, began approaching me, asking me if I could help them, too. It seemed like I had a budding business on my hands. A handful of dentists wasn’t enough to make me quit my day job, but it certainly made me think about it.

One day my phone rang 4 times at work. A few days later, I surprised my boss by telling him I was quitting my job to “make dental websites.” A few months later I moved the company to Denver.

I’m proud to say that we’ve worked with over 900 dentists in 7 countries to help them market their practices online, and we consistently add to our client base. We’re looking forward to the future and helping all of our customers continue to grow and expand their practices.

      Attract More New Patients
Dental PPC is a targeted online marketing service that displays ads at the top of search results when a new patient searches for a specific keyword like “Dentist near me” or “Invisalign Denver.” You only pay for the advertisement when someone interacts with your ads, either by clicking through to your site or calling from the ad. This makes it easy for your practice to control costs. Organic SEO is the cheapest way to get noticed, but achieving the maximum benefits can take a while. Pay-per-click ads allow your practice to hit the front page of search engines, like Google, right away.
 
    
    
  


























  
    
      
        
          Fast Results with Real-Time Feedback
One of the benefits of dental PPC is that you know, to the penny, how much it costs to bring in that new patient. Our team will review calls to ensure that the callers are relevant, and you'll also be able to access the calls for training purposes. Each month, you'll receive a report that allows you to review the cost of each campaign and the results achieved. We'll make recommendations or offer insights in your marketing coaching calls so you know what else we can do to improve your new patient numbers.

Are you looking to increase the number of implant cases in your dental practice?

              How do I know if my campaign is working?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            One of the benefits of dental PPC is that you know, to the penny, how much it costs to bring in that new patient. Our team will review calls to ensure that the callers are relevant, and you'll also be able to access the calls for training purposes. Each month, you'll receive a report that allows you to review the cost of each campaign and the results achieved. We'll make recommendations or offer insights in your marketing coaching calls so you know what else we can do to improve your new patient numbers.
          
        
          
            
              
              How do we determine which keywords to target?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Keyword selection is a critical aspect of PPC campaigns. Our team conducts comprehensive keyword research based on your services, patient demographics, and local competition. We target relevant, high-search-volume keywords that align with your practice's goals.
          
        
          
            
              
              Can we adjust our PPC campaign once it's live?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Yes! One major benefit of PPC advertising is its flexibility. We can make changes at any time based on performance data, market trends, or changes in your practice's services or goals. This might include adjusting bids, adding or removing keywords, or changing ad copy.



          
        
          
            
              
              Can we target specific geographic areas with our ads?
                
              
              
                
                  
                    
                  
                
                
                  
                    
                  
                
              
            
            Absolutely. Google Search Ads allow you to target by location. You can specify certain cities, ZIP codes, or a radius around your practice. This way, your ads will only appear to people who are located within your service area.

              Is Showing Up on Google Enough Anymore?
The goal of SEO has traditionally been simple: rank high, get traffic, book more appointments. But with the rise of artificial intelligence, the way patients search and the way we optimize for online visibility is changing fast. Our SEO team’s job is to help patients find your practice wherever they are looking for care today, including in AI-generated search results or directly within tools like ChatGPT.

Our team also uses AI behind the scenes to support this shift. It helps us spot patterns, move faster, and refine our strategies with more precision. These tools do not replace SEO strategy or experience. They make our SEO process more efficient and help keep your business visible in more places than ever before.
Showing Up Where Patients Are Searching
SEO is no longer just about appearing on page one of Google for “dentist near me”. Patients are now searching in new ways, including AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews. These tools often bypass traditional search results and present answers directly to the searcher:




This shift has introduced a new layer to what we do: GEO, or Generative Engine Optimization. While SEO focuses on helping your website rank in traditional search engines, GEO is about helping your practice show up in AI-generated responses. At Great Dental Websites, we now think of our SEO team as both an SEO and a GEO team. We have invested heavily in research and strategy to ensure your practice stays visible, whether patients are using traditional search engines, local map results, or AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews.

This matters because your patients are relying on these tools to find trusted information and make decisions. If your content does not show up in these places, your practice might be overlooked.
To stay visible, we create and refine content that appears in both search results and AI-generated answers. The suggestions we make are based on real keywords and search queries your patients are actively using. We help your practice show up across:

Google Maps
Organic search listings
Featured snippets
AI Overviews
ChatGPT responses

Local SEO is still the core of our strategy. But the way patients search locally has expanded. It now includes not just Google Maps or organic listings, but also AI-generated responses. We are focused on helping your practice appear in all of these places, so you stay visible wherever patients are looking.

We’re Using AI to Improve SEO Results
Our SEO team also uses AI to enhance our existing work. This includes all the foundational SEO strategies you’d expect, local targeting, content optimization, on-page improvements, and technical audits, combined with new ways to analyze data and uncover opportunities more efficiently. AI helps us move faster and find things that might otherwise get missed, but the core of our strategy still relies on the experience, creativity, and problem-solving our team brings to the table. You still get hands-on work every single month. 


Here Are a Few Ways We Use AI Each Month to Support and Strengthen Your SEO:
 
Competitor Analysis
AI helps us quickly learn what other dental practices in your area are doing online. We look at their content, site structure, and visibility in search results to find opportunities for your business to stand out.


Content Strategy and Optimization
We use AI to generate blog ideas, suggest updates to existing pages, and develop FAQs, all with one goal in mind: helping your website get more visibility. These suggestions are based on real keywords and questions your potential patients are searching for. AI helps us follow content that performs well, identify gaps, and make targeted changes that boost impressions and clicks across Google, Maps, and platforms like ChatGPT.


Spotting Trends and Insights
AI allows us to identify meaningful trends in your data, such as shifts in search behavior, seasonal patterns, or performance drops. These insights help us make timely, informed updates to your SEO strategy.


Technical SEO Support
We use AI-powered tools to help monitor the health of your website. That includes identifying slow-loading pages, broken links, or crawl issues before they affect visibility. This keeps your site running smoothly and ranking well.
Final Thoughts

AI helps us strengthen the SEO foundations we already rely on: giving your strategy an extra layer of insight, speed, and adaptability without losing the human perspective that makes it work.

AI is changing how patients search, and we’re making sure our clients stay visible through it all. At Great Dental Websites, we use AI to support smarter SEO, while keeping strategy grounded in real experience. Your patients are searching in new ways, and we’re here to help you show up wherever they look, even if that means keeping up with AI, algorithms, and whatever Google implements next week.

              Is Showing Up on Google Enough Anymore?
The goal of SEO has traditionally been simple: rank high, get traffic, book more appointments. But with the rise of artificial intelligence, the way patients search and the way we optimize for online visibility is changing fast. Our SEO team’s job is to help patients find your practice wherever they are looking for care today, including in AI-generated search results or directly within tools like ChatGPT.

Our team also uses AI behind the scenes to support this shift. It helps us spot patterns, move faster, and refine our strategies with more precision. These tools do not replace SEO strategy or experience. They make our SEO process more efficient and help keep your business visible in more places than ever before.
Showing Up Where Patients Are Searching
SEO is no longer just about appearing on page one of Google for “dentist near me”. Patients are now searching in new ways, including AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews. These tools often bypass traditional search results and present answers directly to the searcher:




This shift has introduced a new layer to what we do: GEO, or Generative Engine Optimization. While SEO focuses on helping your website rank in traditional search engines, GEO is about helping your practice show up in AI-generated responses. At Great Dental Websites, we now think of our SEO team as both an SEO and a GEO team. We have invested heavily in research and strategy to ensure your practice stays visible, whether patients are using traditional search engines, local map results, or AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews.

This matters because your patients are relying on these tools to find trusted information and make decisions. If your content does not show up in these places, your practice might be overlooked.
To stay visible, we create and refine content that appears in both search results and AI-generated answers. The suggestions we make are based on real keywords and search queries your patients are actively using. We help your practice show up across:

Google Maps
Organic search listings
Featured snippets
AI Overviews
ChatGPT responses

Local SEO is still the core of our strategy. But the way patients search locally has expanded. It now includes not just Google Maps or organic listings, but also AI-generated responses. We are focused on helping your practice appear in all of these places, so you stay visible wherever patients are looking.

We’re Using AI to Improve SEO Results
Our SEO team also uses AI to enhance our existing work. This includes all the foundational SEO strategies you’d expect, local targeting, content optimization, on-page improvements, and technical audits, combined with new ways to analyze data and uncover opportunities more efficiently. AI helps us move faster and find things that might otherwise get missed, but the core of our strategy still relies on the experience, creativity, and problem-solving our team brings to the table. You still get hands-on work every single month. 


Here Are a Few Ways We Use AI Each Month to Support and Strengthen Your SEO:
 
Competitor Analysis
AI helps us quickly learn what other dental practices in your area are doing online. We look at their content, site structure, and visibility in search results to find opportunities for your business to stand out.


Content Strategy and Optimization
We use AI to generate blog ideas, suggest updates to existing pages, and develop FAQs, all with one goal in mind: helping your website get more visibility. These suggestions are based on real keywords and questions your potential patients are searching for. AI helps us follow content that performs well, identify gaps, and make targeted changes that boost impressions and clicks across Google, Maps, and platforms like ChatGPT.


Spotting Trends and Insights
AI allows us to identify meaningful trends in your data, such as shifts in search behavior, seasonal patterns, or performance drops. These insights help us make timely, informed updates to your SEO strategy.


Technical SEO Support
We use AI-powered tools to help monitor the health of your website. That includes identifying slow-loading pages, broken links, or crawl issues before they affect visibility. This keeps your site running smoothly and ranking well.
Final Thoughts

AI helps us strengthen the SEO foundations we already rely on: giving your strategy an extra layer of insight, speed, and adaptability without losing the human perspective that makes it work.

AI is changing how patients search, and we’re making sure our clients stay visible through it all. At Great Dental Websites, we use AI to support smarter SEO, while keeping strategy grounded in real experience. Your patients are searching in new ways, and we’re here to help you show up wherever they look, even if that means keeping up with AI, algorithms, and whatever Google implements next week.

            Local Services Ads

          
          
            Are Google Local Services Ads Viable for Dentists at This Early Stage?
          

          Practices have many marketing options to find new patients, but in early 2023 Google introduced Google Local Services Ads (LSAs) as a new option for the dental industry. LSAs are a “pay-per-lead” model instead of “pay-per-click”, and GDW wanted to test Google Local Services Ads (LSAs) for dentists as a viable lead generation source for our clients.

            How Google PPC Ads Transformed This Dental Practice’s Patient Numbers
          

          In an increasingly competitive market, it is vital for dental practices to adapt their marketing strategies to stay ahead. One such client and practice we work with, located in Fort Collins, CO (population 170,000), embraced our suggestion to use Google Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising and witnessed a substantial positive impact on its patient acquisition and practice growth.

            How PPC Ads Boosted Monthly Conversions for a Multi-Location Practice in a Large, Metro Market
          

          Our esteemed client owns and operates a group of three well-established, full-service dental practices in the greater Toronto, Canada area. However, they soon encountered a challenge in effectively filling their schedules for high-value services. Seeking to address this issue, they sought the expertise of our marketing team to implement a paid search advertising campaign for each location.

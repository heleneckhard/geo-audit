		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	After seeing strong performance in our previously executed UFC GYM direct response campaigns, the UFC GYM team wanted to take a step further and drive awareness to keep filling the top of the funnel. UFC GYM had previously dedicated a large portion of their budget to direct mail and wanted to move more of those awareness dollars into digital, with a focus on leveraging digital video and CTV.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	We implemented localized Connected TV (CTV) campaigns for a subset of Southern California UFC GYM locations with a variety of targeting tactics, including Demographic, Behavioral, and Addressable targeting. A month prior to launch, we set up geo-fences around the selected gym locations so we could filter out employees and current gym members from the campaigns. We also incorporated a list of current member data so that we could identify the lift driven from this campaign. Each location had a dedicated budget and started with an 8-mile radius. Our primary goal was to increase brand awareness, and the primary KPI was unique reach. Secondary metrics included gym visits. We also provided a keyword list for Keyword Search Targeting to capture in-market audiences based on a user’s search terms. We also implemented data that allowed us to target users that frequented related businesses within the same key audience, such as health food stores and competitor gyms.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	The campaign reached 201,219 unique users in the Southern California target markets and drove 910,063 total impressions and 389 tracked gym visits. Corona and Rosemead were the most successful markets with the most people reached, driving over 100 gym visits each at $41.31 and $48.24 cost per visit respectively. Feedback was positive from the UFC GYM team and they are interested in continuing CTV for struggling, Pre-Sale, or locations in dense areas.

						Customer Persona Investigation					
	
	


	
		
	With exhaustive market research, we establish an accurate target audience. By homing in on their unique character, the information they seek, and the delivery they best respond to, our brand-discovery process determines the niche that you – and you alone – can most effectively dominate.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Content Gap Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	Our content team uses this thorough process to document how well your existing content is meeting the needs of your customers. We then compare existing content to ideal production, identifying the gaps that must be filled in order to achieve maximum impact.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Content Calendar & Topic Research					
	
	


	
		
	After analyzing your existing content and your customers' needs, we identify the topics needed to fill the gaps between them. These findings direct the foundations of a new content calendar, where content assets are strategically mapped and sequenced.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Keyword Research & SERP Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	We cast a wide net of keyword research using a combination of web analytics, search trend data, keyword research tools, and more. We then take keyword research to the next level by analyzing the Search Engine Results Pages to discover the type of content needed to be successful in your niche.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Content Briefing & Post Outlines					
	
	


	
		
	Founded on results-driven data and well-crafted storytelling, we create an outline of the content portfolio that will best cater to the personal identities shared by your real-life customer base. Each new piece provides context for future development as we interlink content for a cohesive and self-reinforcing internal-linking structure that ensures optimal SEO ranking.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Copywriting					
	
	


	
		
	Having formulated your marketing plan, our experienced writers produce motivating stories, articles, blogs, product descriptions, infographics, images, and (much) more to deeply resonate with your audience for maximum engagement. The exact wording aligns with the findings of our SEO experts, which ensures that exceptional, polished content appears right where you need it to be.

		Franchising
	
	


	
		
	Brands that make up the franchising community face additional challenges beyond those multi-unit brands that are traditionally corporate-owned. As a dedicated member of the International Franchise Association since 2008, Location3 remains committed to the growth and success of franchising as we've been helping franchise systems grow their customer base and bottom-line revenue for nearly two decades. 
We understand the nuances that come with operating as a franchisor, and how to create cohesive strategies that also support franchisees in marketing their respective local businesses. We help both parties turn data into actionable business decisions, optimize media planning and buying, and increase ROI. Our team includes multiple Certified Franchise Executives and IFA Committee Members, and we actively provide support to a variety of ongoing initiatives with the Franchise Action Network.
By understanding the unique operational needs and complex marketing challenges that arise in franchising, Location3 can help your franchise brand align marketing strategies with business goals, driving growth and increasing customer action.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	During the winter months, while consumer attention may shift away from enjoying the outdoors and backyards, it’s still a vitally essential time for the 350+ retail stores that make up the Wild Birds Unlimited brand to capture consumer spend and drive bottom-line revenue. Beyond this key peak season, many retail locations were feeling the impact of supply chain and lingering issues related to post-pandemic operations that necessitated a need to expand their target audiences and reach new customers.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	To reach new customers around Wild Birds Unlimited locations with precision and deliver measurable performance results, we executed hyper-local Connected TV campaigns with concurrent, retargeted programmatic display media. With the sudden, effective return of QR codes in the marketplace, we intentionally implemented a QR code on our CTV video spots, generating clicks on ads that typically only provide view-through performance metrics. From an audience reach and engagement perspective, we supplemented our geotargeting with contextual and behavioral targeting, custom site lists (for display campaigns), retargeting, and private marketplace (PMP). PMP offered a real-time bidding environment for key ad inventory on the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet channels. We also leveraged algorithmic machine-learning budget and bid optimizations to optimize toward our desired cost-per-completed view (CPCV) for CTV and cost-per-click (CPC) for display. This allowed us to have granular control over the campaign budget for the campaign duration, maximizing efficiency in both reach and spend.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	The cross-channel local media campaign implemented by Location3 generated a significant lift in eCommerce purchases, account registrations, and loyalty program sign-ups. Driving more than 9.3MM CTV spot views, the digital campaign accounted for 4,747 scans of the QR code and 289 conversions directly on-site. The campaign also received top honors at the 2022 Franchise Innovation Awards, including Best Overall Campaign, Best Digital Campaign, and Best Campaign Under $1MM.

	This campaign provided a major impact in increasing brand awareness during the busy holiday shopping season. Without any additional effort on their part, our franchisees gained increases in web traffic, in-store visits and online sales.

		Google Is Retiring the Google Guarantee for LSA
	
	


	
		September 4, 2025 | Tom Lynch | Franchise Digital Marketing | Local Search | Paid Search Marketing	


	
		On October 20, 2025, Google will officially launch the Google Verified badge for all eligible Local Services Ads (LSA) advertisers. This update marks a significant shift in how Google communicates trust and verification to consumers, and it comes with the retirement of the Google Guarantee, along with the Google Screened and License Verified by Google badges. If you’re running LSAs, here’s what you need to know, and what it might mean for your performance.


What’s Changing?

To simplify the badging system and improve consistency across surfaces, Google is consolidating its three existing LSA trust badges into a single, unified badge, Google Verified.
What’s Going Away…

Google Guaranteed (and its money-back guarantee)
Google Screened
License Verified by Google

What’s Coming…

A Google Verified badge that reflects completed verification checks, such as background checks, license verification, and insurance
A consistent badge experience across LSA profiles and other Google surfaces where it may influence consumer decisions

Beyond theses badge changes and implications, there are a few additional considerations we anticipate as we go forward with Google Local Service Ads, including:
Consumer Trust Likely Unaffected

While the Google Guarantee may have served as a psychological safety net, the reality is that most consumers weren’t even aware that Google offered a money-back guarantee for services booked through LSAs. Because of this low awareness, and the rarity of actual refund claims, its removal is unlikely to significantly impact consumer confidence. The new Google Verified badge still communicates that a business has passed Google’s vetting process, including background checks and license verification, which remains a strong trust signal for users evaluating service providers.
Reviews Will Matter More Than Ever

With the Guarantee gone, reviews and ratings become the primary trust signal. Businesses with strong reputations will likely maintain performance, while those with weaker profiles may see a drop in conversions.
Ad Performance May Stay Stable

If the Guarantee was rarely used, its removal may not significantly impact click-through rates or lead volume. But advertisers should monitor performance closely in Q4 to spot any shifts.
No Action Required

All eligible advertisers who have completed the LSA verification requirements for their selected business category and location will automatically receive the new Google Verified badge. For new advertisers, the badge will be issued once all verification steps are completed.


So What Should LSA Advertisers Do Now?

Even though no action is required as we mentioned previously, here are a few proactive steps we recommend considering as a result of this change:
Audit Your Reviews

Encourage happy customers to leave reviews. They’re now your most powerful trust signal.
Update Your Messaging & Monitor Performance Trends

If your website or sales materials reference the Google Guarantee, update them to reflect the new badge. Be sure to watch for changes in click-through rate, cost per lead, and conversion rates post-October 20.  It’s also important to ensure that your customer service and sales teams understand the change so they can confidently address any questions that may arise from potential leads or customers.
Lean Into AI Visibility Strategies

Brand references in LLM’s such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google AI Mode, are becoming the new trust validation sources. As Google continues to expand AI Overviews and large language model-powered search experiences, it’s critical to ensure your brand is cited and surfaced in these results. We’ve outlined actionable strategies in our latest white paper,

Download: Adapting to Google AI Overviews
In Summary

The move to a single Google Verified badge simplifies the LSA ecosystem and may reduce confusion for consumers. While the removal of the money-back guarantee is notable, it’s unlikely to cause major disruption, especially for advertisers who’ve built strong reputations and deliver consistently great service. At Location3, we’ll be watching this rollout closely and helping our partners adapt. If you’d like a personalized audit of your LSA strategy or help optimizing your review generation and AI visibility, we’re here to help.

		Case Study: How We Maximized Google LSA for Service Brands
	
	


	
		December 3, 2025 | Tom Lynch | Franchise Digital Marketing | Google | Local Search	


	
		Google Local Services Ads continue to be one of the highest-intent, highest-conversion channels for service-based franchise brands. By validating business trust signals and surfacing providers directly to ready-to-book customers, LSAs consistently drive efficient lead volume at scale. July through September remains the most active season for service brands leveraging Google Local Services Ads (LSA), and Q3-2025 delivered record-breaking growth for Location3 clients. Here are our peak season results and insights from this year across our portfolio of franchisors and franchisees actively advertising with Google Local Service Ads.
Year-over-Year Performance Highlights

Booked Revenue: Tripled year-over-year, surging 201% signaling higher value per account and stronger ROI.
Adjusted Growth: Removing the ad spend increases from more franchise locations launching campaigns, and increased budgets from preexisting accounts, local businesses saw a 53.6% revenue increase YOY.
Click-Through Rate (CTR): Improved 34%, climbing from 8% to 11.65%, validating the impact of systemwide data sharing across franchise systems, and agile bid management changes at the location level.

Verification Challenges & Franchise Advantage
Local businesses continue to face hurdles in Google’s verification process, where background checks, licensure, and insurance verifications often slow down onboarding. However, franchise brands working with Location3 to implement Google’s Equivalency program for Franchise Systems experience a much smoother path. This program streamlines compliance for franchise networks, enabling local franchisees to go live faster and start generating leads without the typical location level approval delays. Strategic alignment within a broader media mix for our franchise owners also allowed us to shift between LSAs and other local ad tactics based on performance. This flexibility ensures that budgets are allocated where they drive the most impact. That strategic portfolio management perspective, combined with systemwide trend learnings and evolving consumer behaviors, positions our customers to adapt quickly and maintain competitive advantage in a dynamic search environment.
Optimization Drivers

Responsiveness Matters: Accounts with 80-90%+ responsiveness consistently achieved better visibility and lead generation, and 220% more revenue generated. than accounts with 65% or less responsiveness status.
Message Leads: Enabling message leads nearly tripled booked revenue per account, adding an average of $1,800 more compared to accounts without this feature.
Visual Impact: Accounts with 4+ high-quality photos generated 529% higher booked revenue than locations with <4 photos.

Budget Utilization & Growth Opportunities

Constrained Accounts: Franchise accounts with budget constraints on LSAs have inconsistent performance results due to the weekly budget constructs of LSAs versus daily budget pacing of PPC. This underscores untapped potential for expansion for many franchise locations to grow revenue more consistently through prioritizing LSA ads.
Challenges: Fully utilizing allocated budgets can be impacted for enterprise clients with carved-out local territories. Expanding service areas is the most effective strategy but often faces operational hurdles since minimizing overlap is a priority.
Corporate Barriers: Reluctance to enable message leads, limits revenue growth for some local franchise owners.
Lead scoring is being built into our LOCALACT platform API, frequent feedback loops from our local customers will help to further train machine learning models effectively.

The Bigger Picture
Over the past 12 months, SERPs have undergone significant changes, with the advancement of Google’s AI Mode, AIO results, and rising Zero-Click search behavior reshaping customer journeys. Yet, for service brands investing in LSA, performance has not only held strong but improved dramatically. This underscores the resilience and ROI potential of Local Services Ads in an evolving search landscape. Key takeaways for Q4 and Beyond

Invest in Message Leads: Lower cost per lead and higher conversion potential make this feature a must-have.
Prioritize Responsiveness: Aim for 80%+ to maximize ranking and lead flow.
Expand Service Areas Where Possible: Especially for accounts consistently hitting budget caps.
Leverage Visuals: Maintain at least four high-quality photos to boost consumer trust and engagement.
Assess as a Portfolio: Asses LSA performance in comparison with your local media mix of digital ad campaign tactics. Allocate sufficient budgets when Cost Per Results are strong in your vertical for your location.

As we move closer to the end of Q4 and prepare for 2026, we expect continued emphasis on AI-driven automation, budget efficiency, and cross-channel synergy. With Google’s evolving LSA ecosystem and consumer expectations rising, our proactive campaign optimization driven by our LOCALACT platform will remain a cornerstone of continued success.

		Everything is Local
	
	


	
		
	In today's digital age, determining what it means to be ""local"" requires the understanding that your customers live in both the real and digital worlds simultaneously - using their computers, televisions, gaming, and mobile technology to capture experiences, and most importantly, to make decisions in real time.

	


	
			
		
			 Franchise marketing in the digital age requires a cohesive approach across brand and local marketing.		
	
		
		
			 Location3 offers custom local marketing programs to meet the needs of your franchisees. 		
	
		
		
			 Our local marketing platform, LOCALACT, provides transparent reporting and account support for your local business owners.

		Data Science & Web Analytics Capabilities 
	
	


	
		
	Business intelligence through web analytics is crucial to the success of your digital marketing campaigns. Your achievements hinge on four essential elements:

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Data Audit & Tracking Implementation					
	
	


	
		
	The beginning of business intelligence: Connecting your data and identifying the most important data points. The data audit allows us to analyze your data collection strategy and make improvements where needed. We ensure that all of your tracking tags are implemented correctly for the accurate transfer of information.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Customer Journey & UX Consulting					
	
	


	
		
	Understanding the path users take from initial interaction to conversion is important to help you understand what pieces for your digital strategy are working and which ones aren’t. Our team uses this information to help you shift budgets and align your omni-channel strategy closer to what your audience wants.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Conversion Rate Optimization					
	
	


	
		
	Our data-driven testing approach to conversion rate optimization (CRO) ensures that the tests you run are justified and balanced by the way customers are realistically engaging with your brand. This limits your testing scope to practical ranges and can provide new and important directions for testing to ensure all customer journeys and experiences are well-optimized for conversion.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						UX Personalization					
	
	


	
		
	We use data to personalize user interfaces for your brand and customers. We provide data-driven recommendations to improve user experience and reduce friction for your customers when engaging with your digital assets.

		Retail
	
	


	
		
	Retail customers' interests and motivations can vary widely depending on the product category. Some may be motivated by price and are always looking for the best deal. Others may value quality and are willing to pay more for premium products. Some customers may be trend-driven, always on the lookout for the latest styles and products. In the retail sector, Location3 has been helping brands succeed in the digital age since 1999. 
We understand the diverse needs and wants of retail customers and have helped retail brands leverage this understanding to turn data into actionable business decisions, optimize their media planning and buying, and increase ROI. We've been the trusted partner for retail brands, helping them connect with their customers and provide them with the products they love. 
By understanding the unique needs and motivations of retail customers, Location3 can help retail brands align their marketing strategies with their business goals, driving growth and increasing customer engagement.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	With so many franchise owners featuring different product availability, advertising budgets and marketing ROI targets, Ace Hardware worked with Location3 and Google to create a scalable, owner-led Local Inventory Ads (LIA) + Store Pickup strategy for revenue growth for each retailer within the Ace Hardware community.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Ace teamed up with Location3 to engage individual store owners across the country and develop Local Invetory Ad (LIA) ""sub-regions"" for their Google Ads campaigns, allowing participating stores to pool LIA budgets and maximize store visits in their local communities. The LIAs combined targeted local media placements with an innovative use of Ace local product feeds to display real-time inventory for items related to user search and shopping results. This strategy focused on connecting potential customers with their nearest Ace location to make a purchase or a pickup in-store, knowing their product of choice was in stock. Ace used their LIA campaigns to further scale this program to more than 2,000 retail locations in less than a year.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	By leveraging Local Inventory Ads, Ace Hardware has seen a significant lift in store visits and Omnichannel ROAS across participating retail locations. With LIAs, Ace now showcases its Store Pickup and Curbside Pickup options to meet the local consumer when they are searching for products that offer convenient and safe pickup. Key performance results from the campaign include a +1,542% increase in Store Visits, a +23% increase in Store Visit Rate and a +133% increase in Omni ROAS across retail locations.

	Our performance with Local Inventory Ads and ‘Store Pickup’ has been amazing - our local business has grown substantially thanks to the high volume of store visits these ads deliver.

		Retail
	
	


	
		
	Retail customers' interests and motivations can vary widely depending on the product category. Some may be motivated by price and are always looking for the best deal. Others may value quality and are willing to pay more for premium products. Some customers may be trend-driven, always on the lookout for the latest styles and products. In the retail sector, Location3 has been helping brands succeed in the digital age since 1999. 
We understand the diverse needs and wants of retail customers and have helped retail brands leverage this understanding to turn data into actionable business decisions, optimize their media planning and buying, and increase ROI. We've been the trusted partner for retail brands, helping them connect with their customers and provide them with the products they love. 
By understanding the unique needs and motivations of retail customers, Location3 can help retail brands align their marketing strategies with their business goals, driving growth and increasing customer engagement.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	With so many franchise owners featuring different product availability, advertising budgets and marketing ROI targets, Ace Hardware worked with Location3 and Google to create a scalable, owner-led Local Inventory Ads (LIA) + Store Pickup strategy for revenue growth for each retailer within the Ace Hardware community.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Ace teamed up with Location3 to engage individual store owners across the country and develop Local Invetory Ad (LIA) ""sub-regions"" for their Google Ads campaigns, allowing participating stores to pool LIA budgets and maximize store visits in their local communities. The LIAs combined targeted local media placements with an innovative use of Ace local product feeds to display real-time inventory for items related to user search and shopping results. This strategy focused on connecting potential customers with their nearest Ace location to make a purchase or a pickup in-store, knowing their product of choice was in stock. Ace used their LIA campaigns to further scale this program to more than 2,000 retail locations in less than a year.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	By leveraging Local Inventory Ads, Ace Hardware has seen a significant lift in store visits and Omnichannel ROAS across participating retail locations. With LIAs, Ace now showcases its Store Pickup and Curbside Pickup options to meet the local consumer when they are searching for products that offer convenient and safe pickup. Key performance results from the campaign include a +1,542% increase in Store Visits, a +23% increase in Store Visit Rate and a +133% increase in Omni ROAS across retail locations.

	Our performance with Local Inventory Ads and ‘Store Pickup’ has been amazing - our local business has grown substantially thanks to the high volume of store visits these ads deliver.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	Breaking through the noise of the competitive market and reaching customers in local areas to drive impactful actions such as online purchases, phone calls and store visits was a major challenge. In addition, measuring the true results being driven by digital media in each market had become elusive due to tracking complexities and the need for a more localized program structure. 

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Introduce an integrated, full-funnel program across both paid and organic digital presence. Location3 and LOCALACT developed a locally structured digital program across Paid Search and Paid Social for the retail line of business allowing franchise owners to contribute incremental budgets. We also launched upper funnel activations on Display and YouTube to round out the full-funnel strategy on both retail and commercial lines of business.

	Over 6 months, the volume of store visits almost doubled and the Cost Per Result was reduced by 29%. With enhanced reporting, we were able to show the positive impact that the incremental media spend of individual franchise owners was having on performance and create incentive for more local investments.

		Automotive

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	Breaking through the noise of the competitive market and reaching customers in local areas to drive impactful actions such as online purchases, phone calls and store visits was a major challenge. In addition, measuring the true results being driven by digital media in each market had become elusive due to tracking complexities and the need for a more localized program structure. 

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Introduce an integrated, full-funnel program across both paid and organic digital presence. Location3 and LOCALACT developed a locally structured digital program across Paid Search and Paid Social for the retail line of business allowing franchise owners to contribute incremental budgets. We also launched upper funnel activations on Display and YouTube to round out the full-funnel strategy on both retail and commercial lines of business. Supporting paid efforts with owned media, we took over the management of local business listings and optimized them for higher SERP visibility to drive store visits.

        	Whether corporate-wide or that one store, restaurant, gym, or local service provider down the street, there are two elements to marketing franchises and multi-unit brands that always need to be measured. First is the numbers and data that offer insight into how customers find local businesses online and how they decide where to spend their hard-earned dollars.
Then there is the human element, the story behind each business location. The market they serve, the goals they have and the work that goes on day in and day out to create success.
Since our journey began in 1999, Location3 has taken the approach that even the world's most recognized multi-location brands need to support their business locations and franchise owners on a local level, using data-driven strategies and proven tactical executions that help owners and managers overcome challenges, while recognizing and acting on the opportunities to grow from one market to the next and one quarter to the next.

        	Whether corporate-wide or that one store, restaurant, gym, or local service provider down the street, there are two elements to marketing franchises and multi-unit brands that always need to be measured. First is the numbers and data that offer insight into how customers find local businesses online and how they decide where to spend their hard-earned dollars.
Then there is the human element, the story behind each business location. The market they serve, the goals they have and the work that goes on day in and day out to create success.
Since our journey began in 1999, Location3 has taken the approach that even the world's most recognized multi-location brands need to support their business locations and franchise owners on a local level, using data-driven strategies and proven tactical executions that help owners and managers overcome challenges, while recognizing and acting on the opportunities to grow from one market to the next and one quarter to the next.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	JAN-PRO aimed to expand its franchise systems, particularly in Chicago and Cincinnati. To address the need for increased Unit Acquisition in these markets, a comprehensive pre-test was designed. This involved extensive market analysis and the development of a digital marketing program. The objective was to uncover opportunities for Unit Acquisition and establish a sustainable, diverse marketing program specifically geared towards new Unit Acquisition prior to a larger 8-10 location market test rollout.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Location3 and LOCALACT devised a media strategy blending paid search and social ads with optimized landing pages to boost JAN-PRO's unit acquisition. They used precise targeting for those interested in cleaning or job opportunities. Local landing pages were tailored for various markets with city-specific URLs, user-friendly forms, local call tracking, and region-specific content. The goal was to make it effortless for visitors to express interest or connect by phone for lead nurturing and qualification.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	The campaigns were highly successful, necessitating a reduction in investment to manage the influx of leads for the Master Franchisor. A 90-day paid search test pilot was executed, resulting in new franchisees expected to generate substantial revenue in their local markets. These franchisees now have a chance to own their own businesses, becoming part of the broader JAN-PRO network. Due to its remarkable success, the test pilot has been extended to the entire JAN-PRO system.

		Education
	
	


	
		
	Every parent faces the challenge of helping their child achieve academic success and for many, the idea of finding the right school or tutoring partner to support their efforts can be daunting. Every student seeking to advance their education faces the challenge of evaluating in-person versus virtual learning, rising education costs, the growing need for vocational skills, and more. These issues are undoubtedly reshaping education, prompting innovation and transformation throughout both early childhood education and higher education sectors. At Location3, we understand that both parents and students spend a significant amount of time and energy finding their best-fit school, tutoring progam, college or university. With so many options available, education providers need to transform how they engage with both parents and prospective students alike, and inspire them to take action.  It’s our role as a strategic partner to understand the nuances of this decision-making process so that we can connect your brand in a meaningful way with the right audiences at all stages of their journey as they seek to find the best education options avaiable. We offer omni-channel digital marketing strategies, powered by data, to help you find and qualify potential families needing your services, generate leads, and assist throughout the enrollment process.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	Covid created a shift in parents’ roles and responsibilities toward their children’s education and in doing so, created ripple effects in early childhood education and tutoring that will likely be felt for years. Lead volume and program enrollments were declining. The goal was to generate high-quality leads across several tutoring categories – with the goal to increase program enrollment across their 200+ locations.  

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Location3 and LOCALACT developed a strategic media mix focused on bottom-funnel tactics proven to drive more cost-effective lead volume. A mix of paid search, paid social, and retargeting was used to target high-income households with children within a certain distance of a physical location. Caregivers (could be a parent, grandparent, foster parent, etc) would complete an online assessment on the location landing page or call the center to get more information. 

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	Leveraging a combination of machine learning and strategic account management across paid search, paid social, and retargeting tactics, Location3 increased total lead volume 16% year-over-year with only a 2% increase in budget! Our comprehensive approach reduced cost per lead 12% year-over-year and improved the conversion rate more than 20%.

	Healthcare customers are diverse, but their primary motivation is often health and well-being. They may be individuals seeking immediate care for an illness, families looking for a long-term healthcare provider, or patients managing chronic conditions. In the healthcare sector, Location3 has been instrumental in helping brands navigate the complex digital landscape. 
Our data-driven strategies have helped healthcare organizations turn insights into actionable business decisions, optimize their media planning and buying, and increase ROI.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	Keplr Vision, a leading provider of business services for optometry practices, faced the dual challenge of generating immediate appointments for individual eye care offices and effectively managing the dynamic needs of their diverse partner practices. These challenges prompted the development of a multifaceted strategy to enhance brand awareness for some Keplr locations through paid social ads, generate valuable Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs), and optimize the performance of paid search (PPC) advertising across a network of 276 locations.  

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	To address immediate appointment needs and enhance lead generation, Keplr Vision and Location3 executed a dynamic brand awareness strategy through social ads that were also successful in driving business results. Identifying key locations, the company maintained a continuous social media presence to keep their brands top of mind, highlighting adaptability by pausing and un-pausing campaigns based on demand for appointments. This agile approach not only increased brand awareness but also facilitated efficient lead generation.  
 Simultaneously, Keplr Vision and Location3 addressed the complexities of tracking paid search business outcomes across 162 practice websites (276 locations). Implementing a third-party appointment scheduler, and collaborating with Location3's data analytics team, the company has continued to streamline its conversion tracking process, location by location, while integrating its scheduling software with the ad platforms so that more downstream performance insights are gained after form submissions and phone calls are captured.  

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
	
				
					
	
	



			
	
	
		
		The Results
	
	


	
		
	The combined efforts of the brand awareness social ads strategy and the optimized paid search advertising approach resulted in significant improvements for Keplr Vision. The team achieved not only cost efficiencies but also increased brand visibility and a substantial rise in the number of appointments generated.  
 Overall, Keplr Vision's initiatives led to a 32% YoY reduction in CPM, a 40% decrease in CPC (Cost Per Click), and an impressive 59% lower CPR (Cost Per Result) on paid social for driving MQLs. Simultaneously, the implementation of standardized tracking for paid search advertising facilitated a 48% increase in new locations launched, demonstrating the effectiveness of the comprehensive approach in achieving the company's goals.  
 In conclusion, the cohesive strategy implemented by Location3 successfully addressed the challenges of immediate appointment generation and diverse tracking needs, resulting in a holistic improvement in brand performance, and lead generation for Keplr Vision.

						Location Data Optimization & Management					
	
	


	
		
	Accurate location data is essential for local listings management. Not only do you want people to become aware of your business, you also want them to be able to find you. We will make sure every local listing has your entire set of location data, optimize your data for accuracy and performance, and manage that data to ensure every platform is updated and accurate.

	Local listings management involves a wide selection of platforms and listings, and all must be kept up-to-date and accurate. We handle the data updates and distribution any time your listings, promotions, or details need to change – even by individual location.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Bulk Profile Accounts for Google Business Profiles					
	
	


	
		
	If you have several business locations, we can handle bulk profile accounts when working with your Google Business Profile. This will ensure your brand remains consistent in your listings from one location to the next.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Parent/Child Setup for Facebook					
	
	


	
		
	On Facebook, establishing a connection between your brand’s local business profiles and the brand’s corporate profile is an important step to managing location listings on the platform. We help your business properly configure Facebook profiles, to guarantee brand consistency and for more efficient profile management.

		The Challenge
	
	


	
		
	The consumer demand for HoneyBaked Ham’s products is highly seasonal with ~60% of expected annual revenue being generated during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. This makes it crucial to create brand awareness and location awareness during these high-impact seasonal periods in order to drive and convert more consumers as they plan for the holidays.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		The Strategy
	
	


	
		
	Given that HoneyBaked Ham is a franchise system, national and local efforts require a balancing act that ensures marketing dollars are properly allocated in order to effectively promote brand and e-commerce awareness, while simultaneously supporting hyper-localized campaigns that drive customers to local HoneyBaked Ham stores across the United States. Location3 developed an integrated digital strategy for the Thanksgiving holiday season that included a mix of national paid media, hyper-local paid search, and holiday content on local business listings to drive increases in awareness, customer acquisition, and total revenue

		Amazon’s Exit from Google Shopping Ads: What It Means for Retail Advertisers
	
	


	
		August 1, 2025 | Tom Lynch | General | Marketing Strategy | Paid Search Marketing | Uncategorized	


	
		
Amazon recently announced a significant move in pulling out of Google Shopping ad auctions, a decision that is already reshaping the digital retail advertising landscape. This unexpected shift has far-reaching implications for advertisers and retailers alike.
The Impact of Amazon’s Withdrawal
Amazon’s departure from Google Shopping marks a notable turning point. As one of the largest and most aggressive advertisers in Shopping campaigns, Amazon has historically driven up cost-per-click (CPC) rates and fiercely competed for top product listing visibility. With its exit, we’re already seeing signs of reduced auction pressure. This shift presents a unique opportunity for other retailers and brands:

Reduced CPCs: With less competition from a major player, advertisers may benefit from lower CPCs, improving return on ad spend (ROAS). This is especially relevant as we approach Q4, a period marked by heightened seasonality for retail. The reduced auction pressure could lead to more efficient spending during the peak shopping season, enabling brands to maximize their ROI. It will also be interesting to monitor if Amazon maintains its absence during this critical time, which could further shift the competitive dynamics.
Increased Share of Voice: Smaller and mid-sized retailers now have a chance to claim premium placements previously dominated by Amazon.
Expanded Visibility: Retailers with optimized feeds and competitive pricing may now see more consistent exposure in key search results.

Location3 POV: Monitoring, Adapting, and Activating
At Location3, we’re not just monitoring this shift, we’re helping clients proactively respond to it. Our Retail and Performance Media teams are already conducting location- and brand-level audits to identify:

Which product categories are seeing the most fluctuation in CPC and impression share.
How competitive intensity is changing across markets and devices.
What new optimization levers can be pulled to improve feed performance, campaign segmentation, and bidding efficiency.

We’re advising our partners to stay agile and take a data-driven approach to capitalize on this evolving landscape.
Recommendations for Retail Advertisers

Audit & Optimize Your Product Feed: Now is the time to ensure your product titles, descriptions, and categorization are fully optimized to win more impressions at a lower cost.
Refine Your Bidding Strategy: Test Smart Bidding and manual CPC strategies to see where reduced competition presents new efficiencies.
Monitor Auction Insights: Use Google’s Auction Insights reports to track shifts in impression share, top of page rate, and overlap with other retailers.
Test Expansion Campaigns: Explore incremental Shopping campaign structures, like Performance Max with a product feed component, to identify new pockets of opportunity.
Watch the Data Closely: Use a 30-, 60-, and 90-day window to measure changes in performance against historical benchmarks. Adjust accordingly.

What Could Happen Over the Next 6 Months
While it’s unclear whether Amazon’s absence will be permanent, there are several potential outcomes to prepare for:

Other Large Retailers May Step Up: Competitors like Walmart or Target may increase their Shopping presence to fill the void, potentially reintroducing higher CPCs in some verticals.
Increased Innovation from Google: Google may roll out updates to the Shopping platform to attract new retailers and maintain user engagement in Amazon’s absence.
Short-Term Gains, Long-Term Flux: Brands that move quickly may benefit in the short term, but staying agile will be key as the competitive dynamics settle.

Final Thoughts
Amazon’s exit from Google Shopping ads is more than just a headline, as it marks a huge industry shift and a rare moment of disruption in a highly competitive channel. At Location3, we see this as a strategic window for retailers to act boldly, optimize smarter, and gain ground while others are still reacting. We’re actively guiding our clients through this shift, using performance data, industry insight, and local market intelligence to stay one step ahead. If you’re looking to take advantage of this opportunity or want a second opinion on your Shopping strategy, our team is ready to help.

Effective Paid Search management uses a combination of tools and tactics to efficiently target potential customers in a specific location.

		Paid Social Marketing & Advertising
	
	


	
		
		
	
	



			
	
	
		
	At Location3, Paid Social marketing refers to all advertising efforts across social media channels.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		What Can Paid Social Advertising Do For You?
	
	


	
		
	At Location3, Paid Social marketing refers to all advertising efforts across social media channels. Social media is a key component of an omni-channel approach to digital marketing.

		Full-Service Paid Social Marketing Capabilities
	
	


	
		
	Location3’s Paid Social strategists and account managers craft social media campaigns that resonate with your audience and adhere to your brand standards and style. Our full-service approach includes:

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Competitor Audits					
	
	


	
		
	It is essential to understand how and where your competitors are showing up on social media. Identifying where your competition is succeeding and failing can provide insights on what social media platforms are most valuable to your business, what to avoid, and what gaps are missing that your brand can fill.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Audience Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	The ultimate objective of any marketing strategy is to both attract and seek-out the right kind of audience. We will analyze your existing audiences to determine which demographics are most likely to purchase products or services from your company. This also helps determine which social platforms will be best for your business.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Audience Overlap Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	Using a suite of marketing tools, we analyze the percentage of people who overlap among your audiences in social channels. By better understanding audience overlap, we can reduce wasted advertising spend and better target audiences that are more likely perform the desired action – book a call, visit a store, purchase a product online, etc.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Creative Performance Review					
	
	


	
		
	Humans are notoriously imperfect at choosing winning creative. We let the data be our guide to optimizing creative – imagery, video, and copy – to make more effective advertising campaigns on social platforms.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Optimization Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	Our Paid Social experts understand the varying campaign objectives and optimization opportunities available within each social media advertising platform. With our analyses, we can recommend and execute the campaign optimizations that will most impact performance and deliver more cost-effective results.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Campaign Structure Review					
	
	


	
		
	Campaign structure is one of the most overlooked aspects of running a successful campaign. Ads, ad sets, and campaigns must be thoughtfully structured and maintained to successfully execute a Paid Social strategy that works the way it is supposed to. We assess your current campaign structure and recommend changes to maximize your ROI.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Funnel Optimization					
	
	


	
		
	Based on the campaign objectives, budgets, and bid strategies best suited to your business, varying optimizations are available to improve ad performance and minimize costs. Our experts navigate the complexities of campaign set-up to ensure your campaigns are as efficient as possible.

		Paid Social Marketing & Advertising
	
	


	
		
		
	
	



			
	
	
		
	At Location3, Paid Social marketing refers to all advertising efforts across social media channels.

	



	
		
	


	
						
		

			
	
	
		
		What Can Paid Social Advertising Do For You?
	
	


	
		
	At Location3, Paid Social marketing refers to all advertising efforts across social media channels. Social media is a key component of an omni-channel approach to digital marketing. We understand which channels hold the most potential for your brand and how to optimize campaigns across those different channels.

		Full-Service Paid Social Marketing Capabilities
	
	


	
		
	Location3’s Paid Social strategists and account managers craft social media campaigns that resonate with your audience and adhere to your brand standards and style. Our full-service approach includes:

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Competitor Audits					
	
	


	
		
	It is essential to understand how and where your competitors are showing up on social media. Identifying where your competition is succeeding and failing can provide insights on what social media platforms are most valuable to your business, what to avoid, and what gaps are missing that your brand can fill.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Audience Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	The ultimate objective of any marketing strategy is to both attract and seek-out the right kind of audience. We will analyze your existing audiences to determine which demographics are most likely to purchase products or services from your company. This also helps determine which social platforms will be best for your business.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Audience Overlap Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	Using a suite of marketing tools, we analyze the percentage of people who overlap among your audiences in social channels. By better understanding audience overlap, we can reduce wasted advertising spend and better target audiences that are more likely perform the desired action – book a call, visit a store, purchase a product online, etc.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Creative Performance Review					
	
	


	
		
	Humans are notoriously imperfect at choosing winning creative. We let the data be our guide to optimizing creative – imagery, video, and copy – to make more effective advertising campaigns on social platforms.

	



			
	
	
		
	
				
					
			
						Optimization Analysis					
	
	


	
		
	Our Paid Social experts understand the varying campaign objectives and optimization opportunities available within each social media advertising platform. With our analyses, we can recommend and execute the campaign optimizations that will most impact performance and deliver more cost-effective results.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Campaign Structure Review					
	
	


	
		
	Campaign structure is one of the most overlooked aspects of running a successful campaign. Ads, ad sets, and campaigns must be thoughtfully structured and maintained to successfully execute a Paid Social strategy that works the way it is supposed to. We assess your current campaign structure and recommend changes to maximize your ROI.

	


	
		
	
				
					
			
						Funnel Optimization					
	
	


	
		
	Based on the campaign objectives, budgets, and bid strategies best suited to your business, varying optimizations are available to improve ad performance and minimize costs. Our experts navigate the complexities of campaign set-up to ensure your campaigns are as efficient as possible.

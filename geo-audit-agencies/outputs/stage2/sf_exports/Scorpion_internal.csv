				Frequently Asked Questions
			
		
		
	
	
		
			You've got questions. We have answers.
		
	
	

	

	
		
			
				

	Do I own my website?
	Yes, you own your website after the length of your contract with Scorpion is complete. While you won’t own the underlying system, in the same way you wouldn’t own WordPress (or any other content management system), when you work with Scorpion, all the assets—domains, content, and imagery—are yours. If you ever decide to part ways, we'll ensure you have everything you need. You'll have full control over your digital presence.

			
				

	If I choose to leave Scorpion, what do I have ownership over?
	Occasionally, a customer wants to part ways with Scorpion. We always aim to work closely with a customer to understand and address any potential concerns. However, if a customer still chooses to move on after fulfilling their contract, we ensure a smooth transition by transferring full ownership of key accounts such as Google Analytics/GA4, Google Local Services Ads, social media accounts, website content, and more back to you. Our team will ensure you receive your website’s static files, design assets, and content for future use. You’ll need to work with another vendor to rebuild your website on a content management system of your choosing, such as WordPress, Drupal, or something else you prefer.

			
				

	Do I have access to my Google Analytics with Scorpion?
	Yes, your business will continue to own and have access to your Google Analytics. Scorpion uses Google Analytics (GA4) and Scorpion Analytics data to analyze and interpret your website and campaign data, feeding it back into the Scorpion system constantly and in real time to optimize your campaigns. If you prefer to view website analytics through Google Analytics directly, you may do so whenever you’d like.

			
				

	How much does it cost to work with Scorpion?
	The investment you decide to make with Scorpion depends on your business goals. Our approach is to create a marketing strategy that helps you reach your growth goals. We offer several different solutions to help you maximize revenue. Our solutions include marketing technology, marketing services, and digital advertising. We work with you every step of the way to ensure you have the right level of investment and marketing strategy based on your goals.

			
				

	Does Scorpion have a contract? If so, what is the length?
	Yes, Scorpion typically requires a 12-month contract for our marketing technology and certain marketing services like search engine optimization (SEO). Digital advertising services like Google Ads, LSAs, Meta, etc. are typically month-to-month terms.

			
				

	How long will it take to launch my new website?
	When launching your new website, several factors come into play, such as content and design needs, website size, and options for video and photography. After partnering with Scorpion, a project manager will collaborate with you to guide the development process. The timeline for launching a website typically ranges from four to 10 weeks, depending on the specifics of your contract.

			
				

	What are the benefits of a website with Scorpion vs. other agencies or content management systems?
	Scorpion's websites are the only websites built specifically for the needs of service-based businesses. While we use our own proprietary CMS, it's just one piece of our full collection of digital marketing solutions.Unlike generic website solutions, we offer features like client journey tracking, true marketing attribution, and seamless integrations with industry-leading CRMs and technology solutions. Our websites create a strong first impression, and they also use data-driven insights to enhance user experience and drive higher conversions.Scorpion-built websites offer multiple ways for potential clients to contact your business which significantly increases your conversion rate. Whether visitors want to watch a video, get help 24/7, or schedule a consultation quickly, our websites provide everything they need to make your firm the obvious choice.

		We’re committed to reducing our carbon footprint in partnership with the Science Based Targets initiative, and set targets to reduce our operational and value chain emissions by 2030. Since publishing our targets in 2023, we have worked to reduce emissions by actively monitoring our environmental management solutions and transitioning our Valencia, CA flagship location to green electricity. We’ve already seen a 22% reduction in our operational emissions and aim to continue minimizing our footprint and engaging with suppliers to reach our targets.

			This Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) sets out rules applicable to your use of
				the Scorpion Enterprises, LLC. (“Scorpion”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Services and Scorpion
				Technology, including via our clients’ websites and/or platforms (the “Services”).
				The examples described in this Policy are not exhaustive.
			We may suspend, terminate, or take other interim action regarding your access to
				or use of the Services, if, in our sole judgment, we believe you, directly or indirectly,
				violated this Policy or authorize or help others to do so.
			We may modify this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our Website.
				By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. 
			
				General Policies/Requirements.
				We all expect that the messages and communications we want to send and receive will
				reach the intended recipient(s), unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important
				step you can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent unwanted communications
				by only sending messages and communications that comply with applicable laws and
				communications-industry guidelines/standards. To that end, all communications originating
				from your use of the Services (including but not limited to SMS, MMS, webchat, voice,
				and similar messaging channels available through the Services) are subject to, and
				must comply with this Policy, which sets out certain rules and/or prohibitions regarding:
				Consent (“opt-in”); Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”); Sender identification; Messaging
				Usage; Prohibited Content; Filtering Evasion; and Enforcement.
			
				
					Consent Requirements
					
						
							Standard Consent Requirements.
							Prior to sending the first message to an individual, you must obtain agreement from
							the message recipient to communicate with them -- this is referred to as ""consent.""
							You must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the
							type you're going to send.
							
								You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form
									that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed
									a sign-up flow or otherwise provided consent. This record of consent must be retained
									as set forth by local regulations or best practices after the end user opts out of
									receiving messages.
								If you do not send an initial message to that individual within a reasonable period
									after receiving consent (or as set forth by local regulations or best practices),
									then you will need to reconfirm consent in the first message you send to that recipient.
								The consent applies only to you, and to the specific use that the recipient has consented
									to. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the
									consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. You
									also can't treat it as blanket consent allowing you to send messages from other brands
									or companies you may have, or additional messages about other uses for which you
									haven’t received consent.
							
						
						
							Alternative Consent Requirements.
							While consent is always required and the consent requirements noted above are generally
							the safest path, there are two scenarios where consent can be received differently.
							
								
									Contact initiated by an individual
									
										If an individual sends a message to you, you may respond in an exchange with that
											individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your
											hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open
											hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent
											and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular
											conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are
											outside that conversation.
									
								
								
									Informational content to an individual based on a prior relationship
									
										You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided
											that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to
											trigger the potential communication, and has not opted out or otherwise expressed
											a preference to not receive messages from you.
										Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements.
											Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders,
											receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating
											pick-up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times.
											The message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something,
											or advocate for a social cause.
									
								
							
						
						
							Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent.
							
								If you intend to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, you should confirm
									the recipient’s consent by offering them a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from
									those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). You must also respect
									the message recipient’s preferences in terms of frequency of contact. You also need
									to proactively ask individuals to reconfirm their consent as set forth by local regulations
									and best practices.
							
						
					
				
				
					Identifying Yourself as the Sender
					
						Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in
							from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.
					
				
				
					Opt-out
					
						The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following
							language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out
							keyword, such as STOP, STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, and QUIT.
						Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with
							a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, you may deliver one final
							message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages
							are not allowed. An individual must once again provide consent before you can send

					unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms.
				Use of shared public URL shorteners. Where a web address (i.e., Uniform Resource

","
			This Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) sets out rules applicable to your use of
				the Scorpion Enterprises, LLC. (“Scorpion”, “we”, “us” or “our”) Services and Scorpion
				Technology, including via our clients’ websites and/or platforms (the “Services”).
				The examples described in this Policy are not exhaustive.
			We may suspend, terminate, or take other interim action regarding your access to
				or use of the Services, if, in our sole judgment, we believe you, directly or indirectly,
				violated this Policy or authorize or help others to do so.
			We may modify this Policy from time to time by posting a revised version on our Website.
				By using the Services, you agree to the latest version of this Policy. 
			
				General Policies/Requirements.
				We all expect that the messages and communications we want to send and receive will
				reach the intended recipient(s), unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important
				step you can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent unwanted communications
				by only sending messages and communications that comply with applicable laws and
				communications-industry guidelines/standards. To that end, all communications originating
				from your use of the Services (including but not limited to SMS, MMS, webchat, voice,
				and similar messaging channels available through the Services) are subject to, and
				must comply with this Policy, which sets out certain rules and/or prohibitions regarding:
				Consent (“opt-in”); Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”); Sender identification; Messaging
				Usage; Prohibited Content; Filtering Evasion; and Enforcement.
			
				
					Consent Requirements
					
						
							Standard Consent Requirements.
							Prior to sending the first message to an individual, you must obtain agreement from
							the message recipient to communicate with them -- this is referred to as ""consent.""
							You must make clear to the individual they are agreeing to receive messages of the
							type you're going to send.
							
								You need to keep a record of the consent, such as a copy of the document or form
									that the message recipient signed, or a timestamp of when the customer completed
									a sign-up flow or otherwise provided consent. This record of consent must be retained
									as set forth by local regulations or best practices after the end user opts out of
									receiving messages.
								If you do not send an initial message to that individual within a reasonable period
									after receiving consent (or as set forth by local regulations or best practices),
									then you will need to reconfirm consent in the first message you send to that recipient.
								The consent applies only to you, and to the specific use that the recipient has consented
									to. Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the
									consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. You
									also can't treat it as blanket consent allowing you to send messages from other brands
									or companies you may have, or additional messages about other uses for which you
									haven’t received consent.
							
						
						
							Alternative Consent Requirements.
							While consent is always required and the consent requirements noted above are generally
							the safest path, there are two scenarios where consent can be received differently.
							
								
									Contact initiated by an individual
									
										If an individual sends a message to you, you may respond in an exchange with that
											individual. For example, if an individual texts your phone number asking for your
											hours of operation, you can respond directly to that individual, relaying your open
											hours. In such a case, the individual’s inbound message to you constitutes both consent
											and proof of consent. Remember that the consent is limited only to that particular
											conversation. Unless you obtain additional consent, don't send messages that are
											outside that conversation.
									
								
								
									Informational content to an individual based on a prior relationship
									
										You may send a message to an individual where you have a prior relationship, provided
											that individual provided their phone number to you, and has taken some action to
											trigger the potential communication, and has not opted out or otherwise expressed
											a preference to not receive messages from you.
										Actions can include a button press, alert setup, appointments, or order placements.
											Examples of acceptable messages in these scenarios include appointment reminders,
											receipts, one-time passwords, order/shipping/reservation confirmations, drivers coordinating
											pick-up locations with riders, and repair persons confirming service call times.
											The message can't attempt to promote a product, convince someone to buy something,
											or advocate for a social cause.
									
								
							
						
						
							Periodic Messages and Ongoing Consent.
							
								If you intend to send messages to a recipient on an ongoing basis, you should confirm
									the recipient’s consent by offering them a clear reminder of how to unsubscribe from
									those messages using standard opt-out language (defined below). You must also respect
									the message recipient’s preferences in terms of frequency of contact. You also need
									to proactively ask individuals to reconfirm their consent as set forth by local regulations
									and best practices.
							
						
					
				
				
					Identifying Yourself as the Sender
					
						Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in
							from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.
					
				
				
					Opt-out
					
						The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following
							language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent using another standard opt-out
							keyword, such as STOP, STOPALL, UNSUBSCRIBE, and QUIT.
						Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with
							a standard opt-out keyword. When an individual opts out, you may deliver one final
							message to confirm that the opt-out has been processed, but any subsequent messages
							are not allowed. An individual must once again provide consent before you can send
							any additional messages.
					
				
			
			
				Prohibited Content.
				You agree that you will not use the Services, or encourage, promote, facilitate,
				or instruct others to use the Services, to send messages that contain, offer, promote,
				reference, or link to any information or content related to any of the following:
			
				
					Solicitations or Advertising.
					Any messages, communication, promotions, advertising, or solicitations (like “spam”),
					including commercial advertising and informational announcements or otherwise, that
					are unsolicited or for which you do not have the proper consent from the intended
					recipient. If you are a Customer of any Scorpion Client, this includes using the
					Services to send any such message, communication, or announcement to a Scorpion Client
					or any other person or entity.
				
					Illegal, Harmful, or Fraudulent Activities.
					Any activities that are illegal, that violate the rights of others, or that may be
					harmful to others, our operations, or reputation, including but not limited to offering,
					promoting, disseminating, or facilitating:
					
						child pornography, child sexual abuse material, or other sexually exploitative content;
							fraudulent goods, services, schemes, or promotions;
						make-money-fast or “get-rich-quick” schemes (including work-from-home programs, risk
							investment opportunities, ponzi and pyramid schemes);

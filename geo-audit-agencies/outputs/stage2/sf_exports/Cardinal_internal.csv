                        What is healthcare marketing?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The goal of healthcare marketing is to increase awareness of medical conditions and treatments, build trust with patients, and guide them through their unique journey to finding care. 
Through efficient paid search campaigns, patient-centric social strategies, and a full-funnel approach to organic search, healthcare marketing can increase engagement, build trust, and strengthen your brand.
With the healthcare industry growing more competitive by the day, healthcare marketing has become an essential tool for providers to reach potential patients!
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How do I increase patient volume?
                                            
                    
                        
                            A full-funnel digital marketing strategy is an effective way to increase patient volume. Connect with patients at every step of their healthcare journey with engaging social ads and targeted PPC campaigns. To foster organic growth, pair these strategies with a responsive, scalable website fully optimized for search.
Remember, all businesses have their own unique goals, so it’s important to take a look at your current marketing maturity and patient demographics to determine which digital marketing mix works best for you. Leveraging the right tactics and working with an experienced healthcare marketing agency will help you build a strong patient pipeline.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How do you improve the digital patient experience?
                                            
                    
                        
                            In today’s world, much of the patient experience occurs online. That’s why it’s crucial to create low-friction digital experiences. Begin by optimizing your website for mobile devices and local SEO to make it easy for patients to find and connect with your medical practice. Simplify the scheduling process with easy online booking options and automated reminders to reduce no-shows and keep patients engaged. 
Offering helpful content like health tips and educational resources can also improve patient loyalty. By prioritizing a seamless digital experience, you’ll establish your practice as a trusted source of information and care, ultimately leading to happier patients.

                            Healthcare marketing can provide numerous benefits for your brand. By engaging patients at every step of their journey, targeting the right audience, and optimizing your conversion rates, you can generate consistent leads for all your locations.

                            In today’s digital age, the top healthcare marketing strategies revolve around digital prowess and patient engagement. Modern healthcare advertising is more than just selling your medical products and services; you must find new ways to reach and connect with your patient base. Providing a high-quality digital experience through your website is crucial for attracting new patients to your practice.
Leveraging local SEO and running a proficient Google Ads campaign will increase your visibility on the web, giving your organization an edge over the competition. Additionally, having a robust reputation management strategy to establish trust and credibility, as well as developing engaging video marketing campaigns, can significantly boost your practice’s success!
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Why do doctors need SEO and digital marketing?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The healthcare market is highly competitive; therefore, having a strong online presence is essential. Let’s face it: everyone is using the internet to find providers. As patients are now more reliant on online sources rather than traditional referrals, digital marketing is crucial for doctors to attract and retain these new consumers. 
SEO is one important piece of the digital marketing puzzle. Ultimately, a robust full-funnel SEO strategy for doctors will help drive organic traffic AND highly qualified leads to all your locations. Plus, modern healthcare SEO best practices encourage marketers to adopt a patient-first approach, which will help cement your brand as a trusted provider. If you’re not sure where to start, working with an experienced healthcare marketing agency can help you avoid common mishaps. 
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How do you personalize your website to improve the patient experience?
                                            
                    
                        
                            To improve the patient experience, you can start by optimizing your website’s UX to make it intuitive and easy to navigate. Enhancing page load speeds will ensure your website is responsive and convenient while developing a mobile-friendly website ensures accessibility.
You can also provide unique, helpful content that caters to the specific needs of your patients. Creating patient personas will enable you to understand and address their needs better, and implementing patient portals will provide a personal touch, allowing them to manage their health records and appointments conveniently. 
Always remember, before you start your website personalization campaign, mind your campaign’s legal and ethical guidelines to ensure HIPAA compliance. If navigating these technical and regulatory landscapes seems daunting, consider partnering with a healthcare marketing company. They can help you build a HIPAA-compliant tech stack and guide you through the intricacies of effective, compliant digital marketing.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Why is healthcare marketing important?
                                            
                    
                        
                            In the face of growing consolidation in healthcare, practices can level the playing field through strategic healthcare marketing. By creating targeted, data-driven campaigns, they can attract new patients and keep existing ones.
With relevant, personalized content, they can build brand loyalty and encourage repeat visits. Organizations looking to drive high-quality leads, increase revenue, and maintain healthy profits need a robust multi-channel marketing strategy in place.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What is a patient journey?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The patient journey is the healthcare “customer’s” path. It’s every step a patient takes, from researching symptoms and seeking a healthcare provider online to making an appointment, receiving treatment, and post-care follow-up.
This encompasses all interactions with doctors, hospitals, clinics, and digital touchpoints like websites or emails. For healthcare marketers, understanding this journey is critical. It helps you meet the patient where they are, personalize their experience, and build long-term loyalty. Thus, a comprehensive digital marketing strategy is crucial to effectively engage with patients throughout their journey.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How can marketing be patient-centric?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Patient-centric marketing means putting your patient’s needs and experiences at the heart of your strategy. Use digital tools and personalized content to connect with your patients and build trust. Not only will this enhance patient satisfaction, but it will also foster patient loyalty and streamline your operational processes. Remember, a satisfied patient is your best advocate.

                         How do I know RevRx™ is right for me?
                                            
                    
                        
                            RevRx™ is right for you if:

You oversee full-funnel media investments for a large healthcare company in growth mode. The guessing game is getting old. 
You invest more than $70k/month in paid media
Agencies keep prescribing “data-driven insights,” but you want to see the science.
You want to increase patient acquisition and revenue.
Traditional media planning isn’t what it used to be and you’re worried that your investment recommendations will backfire.

                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How does RevRx™ work?
                                            
                    
                        
                            RevRx™ combines two critical advantages: Cardinal’s deep healthcare expertise; and an MMM that uses a full-information, Bayesian Econometric model. It helps CMOs identify optimal investment strategies by analyzing practice capacity, service line priorities, and growth goals. The models we use do well with all manner of study inputs, prior data sets, and any macro factors that you know will influence performance. The more data we can provide our models, the better they’ll be able to help lower the margin of error rates for any scenarios it forecasts. 
The model learns off 24 months of historical investment and KPI data (VOBs, new patients, new patient revenue, etc). The model can use a hold-out test to determine its level of accuracy against historical actuals (the latest 3 months of actuals are withheld) before any forecasted scenarios are relied upon for planning purposes. The model also has data sets of like clients that allow it to predict the performance of a net new channel being added into the marketing mix. 
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What kind of results can I expect from RevRx™? 
                                            
                    
                        
                            Based on MMM, propensity modeling, and rigorous testing, you’ll understand the biggest influences that lead to conversion outcomes and the associated audience segmentation, targeting, and UX/messaging changes that are needed. 
Side effects include:

Sudden clarity about your marketing budget and media investments
Significant lifts in performance, patient acquisition, and revenue generation
Rapid reduction in wasted ad dollars
Your CEO, C-Suite, and private equity people nodding their heads in agreement
The uncontrollable urge to fire your old marketing agency

                            Our team will help identify the best data sources to use for MMM. These often include:

24 months of lead and booked appointment data
24 months of media investment and media front-end data by channel and tactic
24 months of revenue data, by week or annualized
Key macro factors that did influence and may influence performance
Estimated SEO contributions

                Through our partnership, we’ve refined data integrations and passbacks to ensure we’re optimizing to the right conversion signals and business outcomes. With this foundation, we’ve been able to drive lead acquisition volume while maintaining efficiency goals.
By optimizing match types and bidding strategies, enhancing conversion opportunities, and managing overlapping geographic areas, we ensured that SVP would continue to appear prominently in local search results. 
These improvements increased visibility, boosted conversion rates, and made ad spending more efficient, leading to sustained growth for the brand.

                        In 2024, we focused on enhancing budget efficiency, expanding SVP’s presence on Google Search, and diversifying into new channels like Performance Max and Local Service Ads (LSAs). As a result, we reached new horizons in conversion volume during peak season.

                            SVP’s paid search strategy began with a highly fragmented account structure that limited optimizations. We aimed to create a system that balanced individual location goals while enabling scale and efficiency.
Refining the budgeting process, launching an online booking system, and consolidating multiple ad accounts significantly improved paid search performance.

                            We introduced Performance Max in locations with high efficiency and strong impression shares. This lowered costs, making leads more affordable than traditional Paid Search. 
Branded search volume also surged in previously underperforming areas, while cost-per-click in competitive regions fell by nearly 50%.

                            The initial Local Service Ads (LSAs) rollout delivered outstanding results, outperforming traditional search campaigns in cost-per-lead efficiency. 
This success has set the stage for further expansion. By leveraging their efficiency, the strategy aims to drive continued growth and enhanced lead quality across the entire network.

                Together with SVP, we adopted a dynamic budgeting approach to ensure resources are allocated where they can deliver the greatest impact. This methodology integrates three key data streams:

Marketing Data: Tracks ad spend, impression share, leads, and cost per lead to evaluate visibility and campaign performance.
Capacity Data: Considers lead-to-booking rates, appointment availability, visits per doctor per day, and unanswered call rates to align budgets with operational readiness.
Financial Data: Incorporates EBITDA growth, contribution profit, acquisitions, and 12-month new client revenue/ROI to drive budget decisions based on financial outcomes.

This system ensures marketing investments are strategically aligned with SVP’s operational and financial goals, maximizing ROI and supporting scalable growth.

                                                            In case you haven’t been paying attention, the healthcare sector has undergone a pivotal and rapid change driven mainly by consumerization. As more people realize they must actively take control of their healthcare journey and medical decisions, healthcare has evolved into a consumer-driven market. As such, healthcare marketers must adopt the patient-centric approach to marketing to achieve the highest level of patient satisfaction.

                    In the past, healthcare was a physician-focused market where providers can maintain profitable patient volumes just by having the ability to provide care. In addition, healthcare marketers could get away with one-size-fits-all traditional advertising methods like TV, print, referrals, etc. Stakeholders were siloed in their specific roles, which cultivated gaps in communication and care, leading to a frustrated patient population.Table of ContentsWhat is Patient-Centric Marketing?What are the Advantages of Patient-Centric Marketing?Tips and Strategies for Patient-Centric MarketingJust What the Patient Ordered
But with the newest paradigm, the focus has shifted from physicians and stakeholders to the patients themselves–right smack in the center of the care team are the patients. Modern consumers, especially younger generations, are empowered to take control of their healthcare journey. So they’re asking questions, raising concerns, researching their options, and making their own medical decisions. This evolution in healthcare is referred to as “patient centricity.”
In a market where consumers are increasingly more empowered, physicians and care providers must appropriate a wide array of patient-centric marketing strategies to stay competitive in these emerging trends.
 
What is Patient-Centric Marketing?
Patient-centered care, aka value-based care, is about transforming the patient-physician relationship from the traditional all-encompassing (same treatment for similar medical conditions) to individualized care. Patient-centricity fosters individualized healthcare based on a patient’s unique medical needs, preferences, lifestyle, and background. Improved patient outcomes and the cultivation of trust and loyalty within patient-provider relationships support this emerging trend’s popularity.
Hence, physicians and other healthcare providers that want a more patient-centric care method must also update their marketing strategies to align with this shift.
Deloitte Insights predict that by 2040, patients will have the final say regarding the who, when, and where of their healthcare journeys–not providers or health plans. It’s loud and clear; patients want to participate in healthcare decision-making.
Traditionally, care providers have increased their patient volume through referrals and marketing to those referral sources. With healthcare’s pivotal shift towards consumerization, healthcare, and life sciences organizations must focus their marketing efforts toward the patients. This requires them to know and understand the patient’s unique medical needs, preferences, motivations, challenges, etc.
In other words, your marketing strategy must include patient perspectives and address what matters to them. Thankfully, digital solutions help healthcare organizations engage with patients and provide them with actionable insights.
 
What are the Advantages of Patient-Centric Marketing?
Why should your healthcare organization adopt patient-centricity in marketing? Below are the benefits you can look forward to in patient-centric marketing.
Drives Patient Engagement
As mentioned, patients are more informed and empowered to take the reins of their healthcare journey, thanks to the internet and social media. It’s no coincidence that 90% of Americans turn to social media and other web sources for healthcare-related information and not their primary care doctor. This trend is significantly more prevalent with Millennials and Gen-Z patients. Since patients can now research their health conditions, treatments, and providers, healthcare companies must build trust and credibility toward their brands by offering valuable content.
Enter patient-centric marketing.
Patient-centricity uses marketing tactics that aim to educate patients, leading to better engagement. Instead of hard selling, like talking about general medical services or products, this type of marketing offers educational content like information about specific illnesses or ways how to manage certain conditions. As such, healthcare groups provide real-world content, while patients feel like they learned something and are satisfied with the interaction. Engaged visitors are more likely to trust your brand and convert.
Develop a Holistic Patient Profile
Understanding the patient’s needs, motivations, and challenges is one of the core pillars of patient-centric marketing. With traditional marketing strategies, medical organizations have difficulty understanding the unique patient touchpoints within the healthcare system. Meanwhile, patient-centric marketing powered by digital marketing technology gives your organization access to actionable patient and provider insights via website usage, social media, reviews, etc.
As a result, you’ll have created a holistic picture of your ideal patients, which you can incorporate with your marketing campaign to provide personalized experiences. This is relevant because with the advent of healthcare consumerization comes a massive shift in patient expectations as well. About three quarters of U.S. consumers expect their healthcare experiences to be more personalized and seamless.
With patient-centricity, you’ll have a complete picture of the patient’s health, including risk factors, medical history, etc., improving patient outcomes.
Personalization in Healthcare
Patients are frustrated with the rising cost of healthcare and out-of-pocket payments. As a result, they are more careful about how and where they spend their money in the healthcare space. Hence, the one-size-fits-all marketing approach won’t cut it anymore, especially in the increasingly saturated market. If you want to stand out from the competition, you should leverage patient-centric marketing to offer personalized experiences to patients.
Indeed, personalization has been proven to improve healthcare as we know it drastically. Thanks to technology, data, and analytics advancements, personalized experiences are now the norm with companies like Amazon, Starbucks, and Netflix.
In terms of healthcare, a personalized experience means being treated as unique individuals with unique medical histories and circumstances. With patient-centricity front and center, you can provide relevant, hassle-free patient experiences and manifest better health outcomes. When properly implemented, personalization can help you reshape every step of the healthcare journey–from choosing a physician to health plan renewal.
Increased Patient Retention
Meeting patients where they are in their journey helps build trust and confidence in your brand. Engagement and trust will keep patients in your system, and they become valuable marketing tools as they refer your practice to family and friends. The Beryl Institute finds that 70% of happy patients will share their positive experiences with others.
As mentioned, patient-centric marketing increases your chances of providing the best experiences possible–retaining existing patients and turning them into brand advocates. Keep in mind that patient retention is six or seven times more expensive than acquiring new ones. Therefore, it’s more than worth focusing on retention with customer-centric practices.

Workforce Optimization
With the demand for higher-quality and personalized care looming over their heads, healthcare professionals are reeling from severe burnout. Many healthcare systems ran on fumes during and after the pandemic, with staff shortages and decreased hiring budgets. In many ways, patient-centric marketing powered by virtual tools can optimize the workforce by streamlining working operations and eliminating inefficiencies.
For example, digital tools like patient portals and AI chatbots can significantly streamline care management and free precious time for providers and care teams. At the same time, these tools provide unique opportunities to bolster patient satisfaction by improving the communication lines between your team while minimizing phone call volumes.
Patient-centric marketing lessens the burden on your healthcare team, preventing burnout and avoiding the need to hire more employees.
 
Tips and Strategies for Patient-Centric Marketing
How do you make your marketing campaign more patient-centric? Outlined below are some tips and strategies you should know.
1. Build a User-Centric Website
Patient centricity is about offering comfortable experiences to your target audience. With that said, what’s a better way to showcase patient-centricity than your digital front door, your website? Here are several web design best practices to improve the user experience:

Straightforward and easy navigation: Your website must be easy to navigate with clear layouts, intuitive menus, and organized content. The idea is to provide a straightforward experience for visitors where they can easily find what they’re looking for, including your crucial content like blog articles and service pages.
Streamlined content: Remember that you’re catering your website to the patient population. They already find health care complex and intimidating, so streamline your messaging and avoid jargon and technical terms. Also, make your content easy to read with headers, bullet points, and images.
Professional visual design: Use professional images, graphics, and videos throughout your website. In addition, use easy-to-read fonts and colors that complement your brand. High-quality web design is one of the best ways to make a lasting first impression among visitors.
Fast-loading pages: Visitors expect your website to load quickly; otherwise, they will leave quickly. Thus, ensure your web pages are optimized for speed by using compressed images, choosing a reliable host, and minimizing the use of plugins. Use PageSpeed Insights to evaluate the speed of all your web pages.
Mobile-friendliness: More than half of all internet traffic is from mobile devices, so ensure that your website uses responsive design so it loads correctly on desktop and mobile.

2. Leverage High-Quality Content
One of the most important elements of patient-centric marketing is content. With healthcare consumerization in full swing, the importance of serving high-quality personalized content can’t be understated. Having said that, focus your efforts on crafting highly-engaging MD profiles and treatment programs.
With a website redesign, it’s a good idea to revisit your physician profiles, service pages, and treatment programs and revitalize them with more engaging content. As such, you should always provide practical, engaging information to provide real-world value to patients. More than that, high-quality, valuable content will also improve your SEO rankings–thanks to Google’s recent Helpful Content Update.
The Helpful Content Update puts more emphasis on content quality and authenticity. This can be challenging for many healthcare providers since many don’t exactly focus on content creation. However, if you want to adopt a more patient-centric approach, value-based content must be based on an intimate understanding of your target patient’s needs. At the end of the day, it’s about delivering valuable content that matters to your patients.
3. Implement Patient Portals
In order to achieve patient-centered care, you must offer patients timely, accurate, and personalized medical information. This goal can be supported by implementing patient portals in your health system. Online patient portals enable patients to access healthcare information, request prescriptions, and communicate with providers without in-office visits or phone calls. As you might expect, portals give patients easy access to electronically stored and personalized medical information, which can significantly transform health outcomes.
This relates to patient-centricity because research shows that when people can see their health information, they take ownership of their health and wellness and will be more comfortable interacting with providers.
On top of that, patient portals are an excellent channel for personalized marketing because they allow you to push only the most relevant content to individuals. Based on the data on your CRM database, you can display links to educational articles within the portal about helpful topics like “when should you get your mammogram,” “warning signs of a stroke,” or “when is the best time to get a flu shot.” More evidence shows that web-based patient-provider interactions can improve health outcomes, so ensure you have a patient portal.
There are many advantages of using patient portals.
4. Hop on to Social Media
Social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok aren’t just conduits for digital marketing anymore. Social media has transformed into a powerful tool providers can use to identify, engage, and collaborate with patients. In social media, you can listen to patients and hear about their hopes, dreams, concerns, complaints, and expectations.
When it comes to healthcare, patients and their families want authenticity. By listening to social media and gaining data insights, you’ll better understand the patient’s voice and provide personalized experiences. These tailor-made experiences will help you gain trust and form meaningful relationships with your patients.
Those who fully embrace listening to patients on social media will have clearer pathways toward patient centricity. And once again, yielding the best outcomes and solutions for patients.
5. Generate Patient Reviews and Testimonials
Patient reviews, and testimonials are some of the most valuable sources of truth that can shape your patient-centric campaign. With reviews and testimonials, people explicitly tell you what they like and don’t like about their experiences with your practice. Furthermore, 9 out of 10 patients look at online reviews when evaluating a provider. They’ll look at your practice’s star ratings, comments, and even your responses to reviews to estimate the experience they’ll receive from your organization.
Hence, ensure you have a solid reputation management system for generating patient reviews and testimonials. Train your patient-facing staff members to ask patients for reviews after appointments. Follow-up emails, patient surveys, and SMS can go a long way in collecting reviews. Alternatively, you can invest in review solicitation software like Birdeye and Weave to automate your processes.

 
Just What the Patient Ordered
Patient centricity is becoming increasingly important in the healthcare industry–it’s here to stay. Focus your marketing efforts around the needs and preferences of your patients, so you can build trust and credibility, differentiate your practice from the competition, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. With beautifully-executed patient-centric marketing, you’ll likely see increased patient volume and revenue.

                            Our primary goal is to create a mutual understanding of your campaign performance. We’re not here to make the numbers look pretty. We’re here to provide an honest assessment of how we can achieve your business goals with data-driven strategies.

                            We were serious when we said we’re all about transparency. We will never keep your Google Ads (formerly known as AdWords) account from you. You own your accounts, and should you choose to opt out of your contract after the first six months, your data goes with you.

While dashboard reports provide clients with quick insights, monthly reports provide a deeper dive, highly detailed view into key insights and analytics—as well as next steps for improving performance month over month. Monthly reports convey the top-line numbers and hone in on performance drivers like service line spend fluctuations, increase in competition, improved conversion rates from CRO tests, and more. Monthly reports are designed and delivered in presentation format to be shared across your organization and with key stakeholders.

                            We don’t just generate leads. We generate the leads most likely to convert to loyal patients—and bring you the most revenue. Our value-based tracking configurations break down conversions by type to provide you with detailed insight into how many forms, calls, and chats your campaign efforts are really driving. This is the holy grail of tracking.

                            We go above and  beyond standard pixel tracking setup by also implementing call tracking with AI-driven call analysis to determine call quality and optimize more effectively. Our call tracking insights guide campaign strategy and  help identify operational inefficiencies or conversion barriers.

For many clients, this usually includes PPC, Paid Social, and Display.

Reports, in addition to presenting data visually, include key insights, recommendations, and takeaways developed by our team of analysts and strategists.
We offer different analytics packages to best suit your analytic needs and budget.

                Embracing Digital Transformation with New Partnership & Goals

                
                
            

            
            
                One of the largest physical therapy groups in the country, ATI Physical Therapy was having a hard time recognizing the value of digital marketing in driving new business. They tried digital ventures before but found it to be a costly investment with no tangible results. 
This reinforced their reliance on traditional physician referrals, supported by their sales team, for new patient acquisition.
However, a vast number of clinics and increasing competition made it difficult to efficiently drive growth through traditional marketing and referral channels. They needed a new partner who understood how to leverage digital marketing and could accurately report its impact on new patient growth. 
That’s where Cardinal stepped in. To support their digital transformation, we collaborated with ATI Physical Therapy to drive new business, focusing on underserved locations to help meet practice capacity goals through targeted paid media. We also took on the role of strategic advisor, recommending and guiding the implementation of the marketing technology needed to identify lead attribution and measure marketing impact.

                Aligning Digital Tactics with Practice Capacity Goals

                
                
            

            
            
                Before partnering with Cardinal, ATI Physical Therapy had paused their PPC advertising for three months due to a lack of perceived value in digital strategies.
Recognizing the potential of digital outreach, Cardinal reinvigorated ATI Physical Therapy’s PPC strategy with a focus on optimizing spend based on each clinic’s capacity. Given ATI’s extensive network of locations, a dynamic approach was adopted to categorize clinics as “starved” or “stable,” allowing for a more strategic allocation of resources. 
This continuous optimization and collaboration with ATI Physical Therapy has been crucial in directing efforts and budgets toward underserved clinics, ensuring a more equitable and effective digital marketing strategy.

                            ATI Physical Therapy’s existing Google Ads account structure lacked the customization needed to address the variances between the goals and markets of different practices. Also, their monthly budget allocation was too low to support all clinics. Our strategy optimized spend based on practice goals and capacity.
To improve targeting, we calculated the median patient distance for each location (varied from 4 – 20 miles), and each month, we pulled the “starved” locations and increased spending for those to allocate resources more effectively.

                            To maximize the impact of ATI Physical Therapy’s advertising budget, our keyword strategy focused on finding healthcare consumers ready to choose a provider and book an appointment.  They typically have a referral in hand or are seeking direct access to physical therapy. 
We also targeted generic, non-branded keywords such as “physical therapist near me” and “physical therapy near me,” along with other terms used at the last step of the patient consideration journey.

                            We developed new ad messaging themes and copy to highlight ATI Physical Therapy’s unique selling points, including the group’s convenience, cost, and quality of care. As part of ongoing optimization, we are conducting value prop testing to see which messaging resonates best with their ideal patient. 
We also optimized landing pages and ATI Physical Therapy’s website appointment scheduler to identify patients with referrals or those seeking direct access. This allowed us to glean deeper insights into the patient journey and the impact of our digital efforts.

                Having been burned before, ATI Physical Therapy doubted the effectiveness of digital methods. So, they relied on us to create strong analytics and data reports to demonstrate marketing return on investment.
To do this, we built custom dashboards that integrated data from their call tracking software, Invoca, as well as Google Ads. Their dashboards detail an array of key data points, including:

New patient leads & bookings per clinic 
CPL for each location
Total calls per region

These holistic dashboards allowed us to identify optimization opportunities that have increased lead quality and new patient referrals.
To ensure compliance with HIPAA’s strict privacy standards, we transitioned the group from Google Analytics to Mixpanel, providing a secure and compliant analytics framework essential for handling sensitive healthcare data.
Having made a strong case for analytics and data reporting, we cemented our place as a strategic digital marketing advisor for ATI Physical Therapy.

                Thanks to Cardinal’s digital marketing strategy, ATI Physical Therapy has seen a significant jump in performance from February 2023 to June 2023. In just 4 months, they’ve experienced a:

54% decrease in CPL (cost-per-lead)
77% increase in CVR (conversion rate)



We’ve also helped them realize how impactful digital can be when it comes to driving new patients. 80% of new patients generated by our campaign do not have an ATI Physical Therapy-specific referral from their doctor, meaning that PPC advertising significantly drives new leads. 
            
        

        
        
        
            
                As our work with ATI Physical Therapy continues, we’re expanding on our digital strategy, to include search engine optimization (SEO). Given how important it is to educate potential patients before they make a provider choice, our SEO strategy ensures patients find answers to their questions by creating relevant, informative content that adheres to SEO best practices. 
Our partnership has helped increase ATI Physical Therapy’s visibility on search, helping patients find solutions to physical therapy questions, building awareness of ATI’s solutions, and enhancing the kind of brand trust that ultimately drives new business.

                    Consumer trends show that 77% of patients use online reviews as their first step in finding a new provider. The digital transformation that has taken the healthcare industry by storm has completely altered patient-physician discovery and interaction. Now, more than ever, healthcare organizations are taking advantage of the marketing opportunities the digital world offers. In other words, healthcare marketing plays a very big role in the decisions patients and potential patients are making, since everyone is online. Regardless of the type of healthcare practice you’re promoting, the overall objective of healthcare marketing is to connect with patients at the right stage of their journey.

An Overview of Healthcare Marketing
In a nutshell, healthcare marketing refers to the strategy and tools healthcare groups use to increase awareness of services, build patient loyalty, and attract patients. Today, hundreds of thousands of provider groups engage in digital marketing, as they find it easier—and more cost-effective—to reach a large number of patients this way.
In our 2022 Survey: The State of Healthcare Marketing, we surveyed marketers at a variety of healthcare organizations and found that SEO, digital ads, and content creation were the top 3 initiatives healthcare marketers are investing in.
There are many digital healthcare marketing tactics, some of which are:

Search engine optimization (SEO)
Paid search
Display advertising
Social media marketing
Content marketing
Email marketing
Influencer marketing
Affiliate marketing

Traditionally, provider groups reached their target audience using channels like television, radio, magazines, events, and direct mail. Now, as patients spend more time online, providers are trying to reach them through digital channels. After all, marketers need to go where the people are.
If you want to make the switch and diversify your marketing strategy, you probably want to understand the benefits of these new healthcare digital marketing tactics.
So, let’s dive into the top 9 benefits of healthcare marketing:
 
1. Increase Patient Loyalty with Frequent Communication
As you know, it costs more to attract and convert new patients than it does to retain existing ones. Patient loyalty can be difficult to establish, but it’s well worth your efforts.
A patient retained can continue services or recommend your healthcare brand to others, which helps increase buzz for your practice. To retain patients, you need to keep in contact with them and digital healthcare marketing makes that easier than ever. Some proven tactics include:

Make patient feedback your source of truth: If you want to know what’s causing your patients to churn, the best first step is to ask them. Then, focus both your in-office staff and marketing teams on capturing and analyzing patient feedback. Collect feedback through surveys, in-visit interviews, social media, review channels, etc.
Measure key performance indicators most important for retention: There are myriad ways to measure the success of digital marketing. We need KPIs to measure the rate of improvement resulting from our strategies, as well as to focus on future activities. In terms of driving better patient retention, we focus our clients on four essential metrics: retention rate, attrition rate, patient lifetime value, and time between visits. 
Use marketing automation to drive the retention engine: Use MA to your advantage. Think about how to automate touchpoints and processes to improve efficiency and put your organization top-of-mind for your patients. This might include email campaigns, ad retargeting, or CRM automation. You can also use automated notifications and reminders to keep in touch (and keep patients showing up).

 
2. Engage the Patient at Every Step of their Journey
Before healthcare marketing became an increasingly competitive industry, not many people were talking about the patient journey, mainly because it was difficult to understand and analyze. With healthcare digital marketing, we can track every step that a patient makes, often from the moment when they are triggered to search for a provider or find treatment. This journey can encompass various touchpoints, including online searches, in-person consultations, procedures, and follow-up appointments. Understanding the patient journey is crucial for healthcare marketers because it provides valuable insight into how patients interact with the healthcare system and how they make decisions about their health.
By mapping out the patient journey, healthcare marketers can identify key touchpoints where they can engage with patients and offer relevant information, resources, and support. This allows healthcare providers to build strong, long-lasting relationships with their patients, which can lead to increased patient satisfaction and loyalty.
Understanding the patient journey also helps healthcare marketers understand the pain points and challenges that patients face during their healthcare experience.
No matter which channel the patient discovers your practice: Google search, Facebook Ads, display advertisements, Instagram, etc., you can engage with them more easily now. This enables you to help the patient resolve all their questions and objections and influence their healthcare decision.
 
3. Target the Right Audience
It’s now easier than ever to segment audiences since many digital marketing platforms allow you to target a specific audience. We have access to online tools that keep track of an individual’s online activities and demographic information. Digital marketers can use this data to offer users specific products or services that they may be interested in. For instance, once a visitor clicks on a brand’s display ad, whether on social media or through a search engine, the brand can target that visitor with subsequent and related ads. If the content a visitor receives is based on their interests and online behaviors, it creates positive reinforcement and makes shopping easier and more satisfying.
You can also target your audience with content and offers based on what stage they’re at within the buying journey. For example, email marketing can be used to nurture a lead until they’re ready to make a purchase. Perhaps they subscribed to your blog and consistently opened your blog update emails. After several months, they visit your about me and service web pages. At this point, you know to send them a targeted email with an exclusive offer. They click on the offer and submit a request for a quote.
Sophisticated digital marketing tools make this possible. Let me tell you how it works: when a user fills out a form online, he or she provides personal information. Most web pages have cookies that track the user’s behavior on the page. It’s this data that companies or digital marketers analyze and devise the right strategies for different types of audiences.
 
4. Generate a Consistent Lead Pipeline for All Locations
Creating your “marketing funnel” is ultimately the main purpose of marketing. A sales funnel is basically a system for generating consistent leads and sales from traffic. In other words, turning traffic into brand enthusiasts. A sales funnel’s job is to separate the “window shoppers” from the real patients that are going to convert. It can also help improve the patient journey, based on Taboola’s study.
Use the sales funnel to generate leads online through digital marketing strategies, offer relevant and useful information,  and eventually  close a deal. 
An online marketing funnel is specifically designed to consistently generate leads. Here’s an example: before creating an marketing sales funnel, a healthcare practice relied on its billboards and location to generate walk-in leads for its services. Now, the brand is using a digital offer to build a more consistent pipeline of quality leads and meet patients where they are spending the most time.
 
5. Optimize and Obtain Better Conversion Rates
Improving conversion rates is a crucial objective for healthcare organizations as it directly impacts the bottom line. Here are some ways to achieve better conversion rates with healthcare marketing:

Segmentation: Segmenting your target audience allows you to tailor your marketing messages to the specific needs of each group. This increases the chances of attracting and converting patients who are most likely to benefit from your services.
Personalization: Personalized marketing messages are more effective in converting individuals into actual new patients. Personalizing your marketing messages by using the patient’s geographic location, and other relevant information can increase the chances of conversion.
Relevance: Relevant marketing messages are more likely to be acted upon. By providing patients with information and support that is relevant to their current stage in the customer journey, healthcare organizations can increase their chances of conversion.
Trust: Building trust with your target audience is crucial in achieving better conversion rates. Providing patients with transparent and accurate information about your services and products, and being responsive to their needs, can help to build trust and increase conversions.
Optimization: Optimizing your marketing campaigns for different channels, such as search engines, social media, and email, can increase the chances of conversion. By testing and refining your marketing messages and strategies, you can continuously improve your conversion rates.

 
6. Accurately Measure All KPIs
With digital marketing, you can measure everything worth measuring. From when the ad is clicked to when the visitor leaves the page. Everything! You are able to determine how many people saw your ad, how many sales resulted from the ad, and ultimately, your return on investment (ROI). Data analytics software (such as Google Analytics) and social networks or ad platforms (such as Facebook Ads and Google Ads) metrics help you make better-informed marketing decisions at each level of your multi-site healthcare group.
However, it is important that you prioritize the most important data because there are many trackable metrics. This important data is called key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs are those metrics that are related to the objectives and goals outlined in strategy planning and represent an effective business outcome. Some examples of KPIs are:

Cost-per-click (CPC)
Return on investment (ROI)
Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
Customer lifetime value (CLTV)

When you have a full understanding of campaign performance, it provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of various marketing and operational strategies. You’ll know what’s working and what’s not, so you can pivot your strategy based on your unique business goals!
At Cardinal, we use Google Analytics to give our clients monthly reports to provide a deeper dive, highly detailed view into key insights and analytics —as well as next steps for improving performance month over month.
 
7. Gain Credibility for Your Healthcare Brand
Content marketing studies show that digitally active healthcare brands usually end up having the most credibility. Through its content, a healthcare brand can address patients’ doubts and answer important questions.
Useful and interesting content helps a provider group to gain the trust of its patients, as well as that of industry experts. It can be effective to the extent that competitors start to cite it also in their content. Another way to gain credibility for your brand is by managing your online reputation. Patients are looking for providers they can trust. In fact, 90% of customers read online reviews before making a purchase. It goes without saying that your online reputation could either make or break your business— Maintain your online reputation by:

Proactive reputation management  – Proactively manage how you’re perceived online, building a solid foundation of high-star reviews that prove your brand’s credibility.
Scalable review generation – Cover all your bases with multi-location reputation management. Generate positive reviews across all your locations to ensure consistency and credibility.
Improve search rankings – Your local SEO rankings depend partly on great reviews.
Gain patient insight – Insight into honest reviews gives your brand improvement opportunities and a deeper understanding of your patients’ experience and values.

Blogging is one way that you can establish your expertise. Consumers seek out high-quality content that addresses their challenges and questions. Your company’s subject matter experts have insights that are highly sought after and should be shared with your target market. Adding more useful long-form content that gives unique and helpful answers to common queries your target patient has will help you rank higher.
According to HubSpot, companies that blog generate 67% more leads and It takes five-to-seven impressions for people to remember a brand.
Content marketing helps a brand gain credibility, gain trust, and generate leads. 
 
8. Gets You More Bang for Your Buck
Many healthcare groups might think they have to save a lot of money to benefit from digital marketing. But this isn’t entirely true. Digital marketing in healthcare can be very affordable and can often yield high ROIs. A small practice, for example, can reach patients early and begin to scale quickly. It’s also easier to measure ROI at the various stages of the funnel.
Healthcare marketing is all about building an online presence. Even if you don’t have the budget for SEO or pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, a healthcare brand can still use digital marketing to build and connect with their patients. Social media is a cost-effective healthcare marketing tactic that requires little costs, other than your time. Email marketing can also be very affordable.
You may be hesitant to invest in PPC advertising, but it is also a very affordable digital marketing tactic. You don’t have to worry about runaway budgets because the campaigns can easily be controlled.
Chief marketing officers (CMOs) are getting smarter with their marketing budget. Instead of wasting money on expensive TV ads, they choose social media, search, online video, and other online media channels to run ads at a cheaper rate.
Start investing in the media channels that will yield the most return on your investment. 
With consistent publications on a healthcare blog and social media network, for example, you can capture leads and turn them into customers. Depending on how effective your strategy is, you can start a digital marketing campaign with as little as $10 investment on Facebook Ads or Google Ads.
Focusing your strategy on the right audience and executing the techniques efficiently is crucial in generating leads and conversion on a tight budget.
 
9. Levels the Playing Field
Content marketing and SEO require investments, but you don’t have to break the bank. If you can create high-quality content that answers people’s questions, you can rank for long-tail keywords. It may take time, but it is possible.
It is true that big healthcare companies can throw serious money behind their digital advertising campaigns. However, money isn’t the only factor that matters when determining an ad’s rank on the SERP. Both Google Ads and Bing Ads evaluate an ads’ relevance and quality before determining its rank. If you have a highly relevant ad that answers patients’ questions, you can achieve the top spot on the SERP.
 
7 Signs You Need Help With Healthcare Marketing
Now that you know about the benefits of healthcare marketing, how will you know exactly when you need a strong digital marketing campaign? Below are the signs that you need help with your digital marketing strategy.
1. You’re Unable to Maximize Your ROI
The ultimate goal in digital healthcare marketing is to see tangible results from your campaign. Having said that, are you able to get the best possible return on your investment (ROI)?
For starters, you need to determine your cost per acquisition (CPA) – how much does it cost you to get a single new patient. Once you audit your digital marketing campaign, you’ll likely uncover that some methods or channels are more effective than others.
Your campaign’s ultimate goal is to acquire the most number of patients or customers for the lowest cost possible. You accomplish this by comparing the results from all your marketing efforts and which channels yield the best ROI.
If you’re not hitting your target ROI numbers, your digital marketing campaign may be due for an overhaul.
2. Your Social Media Accounts are Failing
Many people think that social media healthcare marketing simply boils down to creating accounts and posting whenever they feel like it. In reality, provider groups should create and post content that resonates with their target audience.
Likes, comments, shares, and retweets are all social signals that indicate engagement. If you’re posting content and updates with barely any engagement at all, your social media marketing campaign likely needs some work.
With the help of a healthcare marketing agency like Cardinal, you can develop strategies that are specific for each platform, keep an eye on social media trends, and be more consistent.
3. You’re Getting Traffic But No New Patients
A lot of healthcare brands are too hung up on driving traffic into their websites without much regard for anything else. In healthcare marketing, traffic is simply one part of the equation when it comes to a successful campaign.
Your website could be generating thousands of visitors every week, but if they’re not booking appointments, it’s a waste of time and money. In this case, your marketing efforts are not highly-targeted to only attract leads that are more likely to convert – like filling out a form, booking an appointment, or making a phone call, etc.
One of the major strategies of healthcare marketing is conversion rate optimization (CRO). It’s the process of optimizing the content and elements of your website to generate better conversion rates from the traffic you’re already getting.
CRO fixes many things that can go wrong in your conversion funnel and help visitors convert.
4. You’re Generating Barely Any Traffic
On the other hand, if your website isn’t generating traffic at all, it’s a clear-cut indication that your healthcare marketing campaign is failing. When you consider that there are numerous ways to drive traffic to your website, it’s either you’re doing it wrong or nothing at all.
Without a doubt, SEO is one of the best methods to generate consistent, long-term traffic for your website. SEO allows your website to rank highly in Google and generate organic traffic.
Just about every digital healthcare marketing campaign will include SEO as one of its many components. However, a well-rounded campaign will also integrate other marketing channels such as PPC and social media to generate organic traffic.
5. You’re Getting Terrible Results From Your Paid Ads
PPC or pay-per-click is a great way to achieve quick results but it can be very expensive if you don’t know what you’re doing.
Many healthcare brands are getting sub-optimal results from their paid campaigns due to poor targeting, unoptimized ads, terrible conversion rates, and exorbitant cost per click. An effective paid search campaign should be properly optimized to target the right audience using the appropriate ad content.
Whether you’re using Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and other paid search platforms, the goal is to be laser-focused on high-quality leads – audience groups that are interested in your product or service.
With a proper PPC campaign, you can get the lowest CPC possible while maximizing your ROI.
6. You Have No Content Strategy
Content is king and in the healthcare marketing landscape, it’s more relevant than ever. Sure, you have a blog and you post an article or two now and then, but that’s hardly content marketing.
Content marketing is the core (if not the most important) component of a strong healthcare marketing campaign. Highly quality content will:

Inform or educate your target audience
Fuel SEO and achieve a high rank in search engines
Earn high-authority backlinks from other websites
Be highly shareable in social media
Make you an industry thought-leader
Establish brand trust and credibility
Increase conversion rates

If you want to launch a healthcare marketing campaign, you need content. For example, content is the cornerstone element of SEO because high-quality pieces will help you rank higher and gain quality backlinks. For PPC, content is essential for your ad copy and landing pages.
Content is the foundation of any healthcare marketing strategy. Without good content, you’ll have a hard time ranking in Google and attracting the right audience that will convert into new patients.
7. You Have No Multi-Channel Strategy
Focusing on a single marketing channel is certainly a “putting all your eggs in one basket” situation. Even if you’re getting good results from that sole marketing channel, what will you do if that particular strategy dries up?
In digital marketing, it’s highly recommended that you adopt a multi-channel strategy. We’re not saying that you should hop on all of them – after all, not every marketing channel will work for all businesses.
In addition, you shouldn’t have a multi-channel campaign just because you can. All your chosen channels should fit into the bigger picture and be cohesive.
The main purpose of having multi-channel strategies is to fill the gaps in your marketing campaign. Otherwise, a disjointed campaign will cause you to miss out on potential patients, lose prospects while navigating your sales funnel, and communicate inconsistent brand identity.

                North American Dental Group (NADG), a leading DSO with over 240 locations across 15 states, came to Cardinal seeking to better leverage its marketing technology stack to drive new patient growth and lower acquisition costs. Their first goal was to understand the true cost of acquiring a new patient booking to establish a baseline for performance improvement.
We assisted NADG in optimizing their Patient Prism and Nexhealth configurations, implementing more robust data integrations and passbacks with Google Ads, and improving conversion tracking. These efforts provided greater insight into the actual cost of a booked appointment. With this data, we could then optimize their revenue-based bidding strategy to reach high-value leads.
Our team also restructured their paid search campaigns, utilizing historical revenue data and geo-tracking to improve campaign and ad group strategies. We refined ad messaging to highlight their value propositions, strengthening their presence on the search engine results pages (SERPs) and boosting conversion rates.

                Before turning to Cardinal, Peak Dental’s marketing efforts were fragmented, involving different agencies for various locations. To improve efficiency and guide marketing strategy for their entire platform, the organization determined that they should partner with a single agency that could handle all their digital marketing.
During ongoing expansion, Cardinal stepped in as a growth partner to Peak Dental, centralizing their marketing operations and guiding strategy to drive new patient acquisition. As a result of our holistic, hands-on approach, Peak Dental has seen a dramatic increase in lead volume, conversion rate, and click-through rate, as well as a significant boost in organic performance across their various domains.

                        Do I need a brand-new website to market my dental practice to new patients?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No. If you have an existing dental website on WordPress that functions well, we can work on it. Alternatively, if your website isn’t on WordPress, we can help you migrate it to WordPress from any platform.
On the other hand, Cardinal can also lend you a hand if you’re unhappy with your current website because of poor usability, design, or performance. Your dental website is one of your primary marketing tools, and robust web design inspires confidence and trust.
Cardinal specializes in building professional-looking websites with responsive design, an effective brand presence, and a strong SEO foundation. In addition, we also offer a Full-funnel Content Strategy to ensure that the content on your site delivers the right message and is optimized for every phase of the patient’s journey – converting potential patients into paying customers.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                         How long does it take to see the results of your digital marketing efforts for my DSO?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The only correct answer is: it depends.
Digital marketing is not an overnight process; the planning and strategizing phases alone could take weeks, if not months. With that said, Cardinal sets measurable goals and objectives for our clients every three months, and the actual time frame depends on the services you require. For instance, paid search campaigns can deliver tangible results within 90 days, while a full-scale SEO plan may take 3-6 months to a year for you to see meaningful results.
Furthermore, several influencing factors may affect how long before you see your dental marketing results. These include your current search rankings, content library, the competition, etc. The bottom line is that marketing takes time, so patience is key.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Will Cardinal handle all marketing for my DSO?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Cardinal is a full-service digital marketing agency trusted by the nation’s top DSOs. From SEO to web design and patient growth strategy to conversion rate optimization, our wide range of digital marketing services will help you turn your practice into patient-generating machines and achieve scalable growth. However, the only services we don’t offer are email marketing, social media posts, and traditional marketing (we’re a digital agency, after all).
With that said, Cardinal is your one-stop shop for dentist digital marketing. For example, our SEO services stand out because we help dental and DSO clients scale their strategies for new markets and locations. Plus, we recognize the power of local SEO when it comes to dental clinics for increased visibility within your area and attracting new patients.
Cardinal will create a digital marketing plan tailored to your business from scratch, regardless of which services you require. We believe there’s no such thing as a “one size fits all” approach in digital marketing. However, as the top dentist digital marketing agency, we will leverage proven, bespoke strategies and previous successful campaigns to grow your practice.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you market my dental practice for general cleanings and high-dollar services like dentures and implants?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, we can. At Cardinal, we always try to focus on the client’s service lines that are most critical to the business and go from there. However, we do recognize the importance of attracting high-value patients seeking specific treatments (e.g., dentures and implants) and how they can help the growth and success of your practice.
Therefore, if you want higher ticket patients for your higher-end services, we can start marketing them first, then work our way down to more general services like cleaning. One of the best ways to achieve this is to optimize your DSO’s PPC campaigns by refining keyword strategy, optimizing campaign structure, and tailoring ad creatives for your high-end services.
Then, we will create custom landing pages for your high-dollar services like implants and dentures, where we will link your PPC ads. On your landing pages, potential patients will learn critical information like your practice and location, details about specific services, insurance information, and more.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        I have multiple dental practice locations, can you help me market locations based on capacity?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes. Our PPC campaigns are flexible when it comes to ad spending, and we can tweak them based on which locations need more patients. However, when scaling your campaigns based on locations, we will make sure that it will positively impact your ROI instead of simply increasing bids or creating a load of new campaigns.

                            The goal of paid search is to drive more prospective clients to your website and convert those qualified leads into new patients.

                            In today’s competitive marketplace, your primary care or family practice website needs search engine optimization (SEO). If your site is not highly ranked, prospective patients will not find you. Most searches never make it past the first page. Our goal is to drive people to your website and then convert those leads into loyal patients.

                            Paid social platforms such as Facebook have millions of users in the U.S.; tapping into this market can help you reach the people who are interested in the treatments you offer. We use segmentation to identify prospective patients based on location, age, gender, and estimated income to offer you high conversion rates and qualified leads.

                            So you’ve got a lot of people visiting your primary care or family practice website, but you’re not getting that many phone calls, consultations, or appointments. Don’t fret! A strong conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategy can help increase the quality of your leads and make the most out of the traffic that you’re already receiving.

                            If you’re not tracking your primary care or family practice website data, you will never be able to tell which campaigns are driving results, which offers are working, and which pages need better optimization.

                            The first place patients go to find a primary care or family practice facility is online. Whether they find your facility through SEO, PPC, or word-of-mouth, make sure your website loads quickly and is easy to navigate. First impressions go far. Your website not only needs to be sleek and well optimized, but it needs to be responsive across all devices. We make sure that once a web visitor finds your website, they can quickly find the information they are looking for, whether that be on their desktop or mobile device. BAM – hello higher conversion rates and new patients!

                AllCare, a trusted provider of comprehensive healthcare services with over 30 locations across Virginia, Maryland, Washington D.C., and Georgia, needed a digital transformation and creative overhaul to elevate their image and clearly define their service offerings.
Cardinal created a scalable website tailored to the patient journeys for immediate and primary services. A refined UX and strong SEO foundation allow users to find the information and care they need quickly. Overall, the initiative aimed to create a cohesive and modern experience across all touchpoints, setting the brand up for continued expansion.

                Frequently Asked Questions

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                         Is a new website necessary to market my primary care practice?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No. We can proceed to the planning phase if your existing primary and family care website is well-designed and functional. The only soft requirement we have is that your website should be on the WordPress platform. We highly recommend WordPress because it’s user-friendly, offers tons of plugins, SEO-friendly, and has a well-designed backend.
What if you don’t like the current state of your website? Cardinal is more than happy to help. Our web design experts will make sure that your website looks professional and high-quality to inspire trust and credibility from visitors. Furthermore, we’ll ensure your family practice website works flawlessly on desktop computers and mobile devices, and it features a strong SEO foundation.
Finally, your Cardinal team will optimize your website in a way that will gently guide your visitors toward your sales funnel, resulting in more conversions.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you give me a timeline of results?
                                            
                    
                        
                            As much as we want to, we can’t or we risk giving false promises. The only correct answer to this question is, it depends.
Digital marketing takes time and requires a multi-pronged approach that involves long-term strategies and execution. If an agency promises quick results like getting “your website on the first page” in just weeks, they’re either lying or using black-hat tactics–the latter will result in massive penalties from search engines and ad platforms.
For an actual timeframe, it depends on various factors like your current marketing status, your competition, and requested services. For instance, your PPC campaign may take off in as early as 90 days. In contrast, it can take about 3-6 months to a year before a full-scale SEO plan will display meaningful results.
With that said, Cardinal will ensure you’re always kept on the loop regarding your campaign. We set performance-based goals for all clients every three months and provide comprehensive reports, KPIs, and strategy roadmaps. Our goal is to develop a mutual understanding of your campaign performance.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you handle all aspects of our marketing?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, but only digital since we don’t cover traditional “offline” advertising (e.g., print, TV, radio etc.). Cardinal is a full-service digital marketing agency that provides a wide assortment of services that will elevate your practice to new growth heights. Think of us as your one-stop shop for core digital marketing solutions such as SEO, PPC management, web design, conversion rate optimization (CRO), Facebook Ads marketing, and reputation management.
As your strategic growth partner, you’re also leveraging our team’s intimate knowledge and expertise about the healthcare industry, including primary care and family practice. Even if you have an in-house team, we can come onboard as consulting partners and collaborate for your practice’s success.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you market my family practice to highlight specific services like immunizations and wellness checks?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Absolutely! As your strategic growth partner, our goal is to support your top priorities. During onboarding, we’ll talk about your goals and priority service lines (e.g., wellness visits, physicals, immunizations, etc.). If you want to prioritize potential patients looking for specific services like immunizations and wellness checks, your Cardinal team will help you book those types of patients.
Our main strategy is to develop a robust paid search campaign. At first, we’ll tune up your keyword strategies (e.g., nurture high-performing keywords, use negative keywords), improve your ad creatives and copy (for higher Ad Quality Score), and optimize your account structure–all to drive higher quality leads for your priority service lines.
Next, we can leverage the power of paid social media marketing using Facebook Ads. Here, the goal is to increase brand awareness and generate early demand among local Facebook users. With Facebook’s advanced targeting parameters, we can cover several marketing touchpoints of the patient journey.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you market my multi-location primary care practice based on capacity?
                                            
                    
                        
                            At Cardinal, growing multi-location healthcare businesses is where our hearts are. Our digital marketing brand specializes in scalable growth strategies that align with your goals, target audience, and budgets. For instance, we can tweak your PPC ad spend so it prioritizes one or two of your primary care locations that need more patients. Of course, we’re not just going to increase the bids for your priority locations and be done with it. Lead generation and efficiency will remain our central focus.
Our primary goals are to monitor performance, communicate results, and consistent goal alignment, ensuring we’re always on the same page and supporting the locations that matter the most to your bottom line.

                    Up until now, I’ve hated agencies. Cardinal has changed my mind—there is at least ONE incredible one out there. Their multi-site design is genius and connects the right audience to the right content at the right time. The work Cardinal has done has been thoughtful, creative, and compelling. It's some of the best I’ve seen in my career.

                We tailor patient acquisition strategies to each of your location’s specific needs, acknowledging that capacity goals vary across your system.
A one-size-fits-all marketing approach can lead to imbalances—leaving some practices starving for patients while others grapple with overbooking and extended appointment wait times that damage patient experience.
From launching de novos with a strong start to efficiently managing well-established practices, we’re laser-focused on filling appointment books where needed. Our deep multi-site expertise and a focus on goal alignment ensure that you don’t overspend where demand is already high and that you get the biggest impact from your marketing investment.

                    Are You Reaching the Right Consumers?
In healthcare marketing, success isn’t just about generating leads—it’s about generating the right leads. Yet many organizations struggle with poor lead quality, filling the pipeline with patients who are not the right fit. This leads to wasted marketing spend, lower conversion rates, and frustration for both providers and patients.Table of Contents1) Identify The Problem2) Define Your Goals, Position, & Audience3) Implement Advanced Media Tactics4) Test & Refine5) Optimize the Patient ExperienceConclusion
In healthcare, the harsh reality is that no single organization can help everybody. I’d like to take that notion a step further. No single healthcare organization should help everybody. Why? Because every healthcare journey is a little bit different. And if it’s not a good fit, neither the patient nor the healthcare organization will arrive at the best outcome. 
Unfortunately, many healthcare organizations are great at reaching a lot of the wrong people. One reason that I’d like to address head-on is poor lead quality. I see it all the time: the marketing team puts a high volume of leads into the pipeline, but the quality is poor. It’s not a fit. As a result, those patients aren’t converting into booked appointments. This, in turn, costs the organization time and money. 
That goes double for mental healthcare, addiction treatment, aesthetic and plastic surgery, or any other healthcare with similarly heavy consideration before a purchase decision. If it’s already tough to get the right patients to commit, you’re never going to meet your goals chasing the wrong people.
Your best option, therefore, is to make sure you’re reaching the right people.
How To Reach The Right People
The first step, as always, is recognizing that the problem exists. Looking at key metrics and data points like CVR and booking rates will help you evaluate whether you’re not reaching the right people currently. Once you’ve identified the problem, you can put together a strategy to solve it by defining your ideal patient and figuring out how your unique selling proposition aligns with their needs.


From there, you can dive into the nuts and bolts of leveraging the data you have to achieve the results you want. Expect to do a lot of testing to figure out the most effective marketing tactics to reach your ideal audience. Beyond your marketing strategy, there’s typically plenty of room for improving the patient experience and removing any remaining barriers between you and your ideal patients.
That’s a concise summary of the 5-step process for reaching the right people, but of course, the devil is in the details—so here are the details.




 
1) Identify The Problem
Evaluate the Leads You’re Already Creating
“Measurement is the path to understanding,” a Very Wise Person once said. You need to examine your existing lead data to see where the good leads come from and where there’s room for improvement. The data should show you what good and bad leads search for and the steps they take along the journey. It will show you where leads come from, too (PPC, Facebook Ads, organic search, and so on). 
As you parse the data, look for trends that might indicate an opportunity for improvement. You’re looking for those a-ha moments in the journey where you say, “Ah, THAT’S why so many of our surgery leads don’t convert—they need more information on post-surgery rehabilitation care.” To that end, a few important metrics ought to provide some clues: 

Click-through rate (CTR)
Conversion rate (CVR)
Call to booking CVR

Know How to Spot the Signs of Suffering Lead Quality
As part of your evaluation, you’ll want to look for the common signs and causes of poor lead quality. The three most common causes that we see are: 
Mismatch between what the lead wants and what you offer
How well do you know your ideal customers and what they want? If you’re not meeting their needs and intent at each stage, your lead-generation metrics will suffer.
Messaging either over promises or inaccurately describes your solution
Expectations are everything. If a lead enters your pipeline expecting to consult with a surgeon but can’t get an appointment for six months, you might have a problem. Or your website says you offer a service that you really don’t. 
Messaging doesn’t provide enough detail about your solution
One common example is the healthcare provider that doesn’t offer insurance information on their website. What happens when leads come in that may need a different type of insurance or payment option? Insurance is a widespread objection.
Understand How HIPAA Limits Your Options
Healthcare marketing comes with one big challenge: HIPAA’s tight grip on privacy. 
HIPAA compliance has become increasingly complex over the past two years as evolving privacy regulations have raised the stakes for healthcare marketers. With new clarifications and legal challenges reshaping the landscape, organizations must now navigate tighter restrictions while facing heightened scrutiny. These recent shifts demand a deeper understanding of the boundaries between marketing strategies and patient privacy, making compliance more crucial—and challenging—than ever before.
In December 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a bulletin that tightened regulations on how healthcare information is shared. The bulletin stated that regulated entities cannot use tracking technologies if doing so would result in unauthorized disclosures of protected health information (PHI).
Tracking technologies include scripts or codes on websites or apps that collect user data through cookies, web beacons, tracking pixels, session replay scripts, and fingerprinting tools. However, this definition has faced legal challenges. On January 5, 2024, the American Hospital Association (AHA) and other organizations filed a lawsuit claiming that an IP address combined with a visit to a specific health-related webpage doesn’t qualify as PHI.
On June 20, 2024, the court ruled that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) overstepped its authority by trying to regulate this “Proscribed Combination.” While the ruling leaves other HIPAA rules intact, it remains uncertain how aggressively the OCR will push for stricter enforcement in this area. 
With the regulatory landscape still unclear and the threat of class action lawsuits remaining, healthcare organizations must assess their risk tolerance when developing digital marketing strategies. We recommend healthcare providers consult with their legal and compliance teams and make sure their marketing strategy adheres to the latest privacy rules. This not only helps protect you from lawsuits but also meets the privacy expectations of today’s consumers.

 
2) Define Your Goals, Position, & Audience
Research the Ideal Patient
Your ideal patients are looking for you. But if you want them to find you, you need to understand who they are as a whole person. Knowing some keywords they use is a good first step, but focusing too narrowly on specific keywords will limit your ability to reach your ideal patients. By considering them as whole people and understanding what makes them an ideal fit, you’ll be able to shift your perspective and find new tactics for reaching the audience you want to reach.
To do that, you’ll need to leverage your available data to put together a more comprehensive ideal patient profile and persona. You can analyze everything from on-site usage metrics and usability testing data to intake data and exit interviews to user geodata. You may also want to send out surveys to gather additional data.
Once you have crunched all that data, you’ll be able to build an ideal patient persona, which you can then target for further research by interviewing patients or potential patients who fit the profile, as well as doing some competitive analysis to understand what approach others in the market are taking. 

By gaining a fuller understanding of your ideal patients and who they are, you’ll be better positioned to devise new methods of reaching them. That will allow you to develop campaigns more likely to reach your ideal patient by considering things like:

Clinical Suitability: Target by diagnosis, provider visits, prescriptions, etc.
Financial Qualifications: Household income targeting, Payor targeting, etc.
Warm Audiences: Reaching the decision maker, Household-level targeting to reach parents, etc.

Gain Stronger Marketing – Ops Alignment
Marketing needs to be in conversation with operations to understand exactly who your ads need to be reaching and adjust accordingly. Focusing purely on lead volume without optimizing for quality leads results in a high volume of disqualified leads —especially in verticals like behavioral, where leads are frequently disqualified for a variety of reasons from age requirements to insurance.
Aligning with operations to understand why leads are disqualified will help you understand what a qualified lead looks like—and let you feed better signals to platforms like Google Ads to refine your media strategy.
There’s no giant bucket labeled “ideal patients.” Well, maybe if your 3-year-old daughter wants to play doctor, then everyone’s an ideal patient. However, for actual healthcare organizations, what makes an ideal patient is nuanced and will vary based on vertical, service lines, market, and provider groups. So you can’t just grab someone else’s ideal patients; you need YOUR ideal patients, and that means strong alignment with operations around defining your ideal patient profile. That’s how you’re going to improve lead quality and drive more new appointments.

Define Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP)
In How to Define Your USP and Improve Your Healthcare Marketing, I go into great detail on the importance of a crystallized USP. The strength and specificity of your USP will differentiate you in crowded and competitive markets. It can help improve lead quality by engaging and persuading your ideal patient.
To define your USP, you can use many of the same avenues you use for keyword and customer research. Generally, think about the unique capabilities or services that you offer. Special equipment or technology? Training, experience, or credentials? What about your patient experience? These are common differentiators for healthcare providers.

Understand Your Marketing Maturity Level
Another important strategic consideration is to understand how mature your marketing is currently, so you can build a roadmap for getting from where you are now to where you want to be. This is going to differ based on your current Martech stack, integrations, brand architecture, performance of existing channels, core marketing tactics, key metrics, etc.
For example, if all of your tracking relied on pixels and other PHI trackers that are now in violation of HIPAA and you haven’t found a good replacement option yet, you’re still at the earliest stages of marketing maturity, and your immediate goal should be to implement some compliant tracking options so you have data to pass to Google Ads and SEO.
If your marketing is a bit more mature and you’re using that data to advertise on Google Ads, but still not maxing out impression share, then you want to focus on optimizing your current demand capture before you start expanding into new channels like Meta.

Each stage of marketing maturity builds the foundation for the next stage. So, you need to know where you are now to know what you should do next. You don’t want to worry about diversifying your media mix and expanding into demand generation before you maximize the demand capture campaigns you already have running. You can’t maximize your demand capture campaigns if you don’t have basic tracking data to pass to the ad platforms in the first place.
So take the time to look at where you are now. 

Do you have an integrated tech stack across brands?
Are you still only tracking clicks, or are you able to track booked appointments?
Is conversion data being passed back to the ad platforms?
Are marketing platforms connected to your PMS? Can you determine ROAS?

The draw to diversify your media mix can be strong, but first, you need to build a solid martech foundation.
Your roadmap for moving your marketing forward should start with taking care of the low-hanging fruit at your current stage because that’s how you’ll put yourself in a much better position to get your marketing to where you want it to be. Once you’ve laid out your strategic roadmap, then you can better understand where your focus needs to be on a tactical level.

 
3) Implement Advanced Media Tactics
To truly elevate lead quality, it’s essential to focus on tactical execution. Now that you’ve aligned your brand and strategy with what your ideal patients need, the next step is deploying targeted tactics that fine-tune your audience targeting and lead quality. From tracking calls to better understand patient interactions to optimizing Google Ads bidding strategies and using advanced tactics like third-party claims data and geofencing, these methods allow for smarter decision-making, ensuring your focus stays on the highest-quality leads.
Train the Algorithms with Conversion Signals
Not all leads are equal. A campaign that looks successful on paper—filled with clicks and form submissions—may not translate into actual patient bookings.
Digital ad platforms like Google Ads and Meta Ads rely on conversion signals—key data points that indicate valuable actions like booked appointments. These signals guide machine learning algorithms, improving lead quality and campaign efficiency.
2 Reasons  High-quality Converion Signals Matter:

Lead Quality Over Quantity: Prioritizing booked appointments over surface-level interactions (e.g., clicks, page visits, downloads) improves patient acquisition.
Optimized Bidding Strategies: Feeding platforms the right signals enhances Target CPA and ROAS strategies, leading to better budget allocation.

How to Train the Algorithm with Better Data
To improve ad performance and conversion rates, implement:

Offline Conversion Tracking: Send anonymized booked appointment data back to ad platforms to refine targeting.
Privacy-Compliant Data Tools: Platforms like Freshpaint securely pass conversion data while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
Booking System Integrations: Sync tools like NextHealth with Google Ads to optimize for real patient conversions, not just interactions.

Implement Call and Lead Tracking Software
Not all phone calls are created equal either. A patient scheduling an appointment is far more valuable than someone asking for directions—but without call tracking, ad platforms won’t know the difference.
Phone calls are inherently nebulous and difficult to measure in terms of quality. Manual call analysis is time-consuming and lacks real-time optimization. You also can’t send manual analysis notes back to the algorithms used in advertising to optimize toward qualified calls.
That’s why we recommend HIPAA-compliant call and lead tracking solutions that classify and analyze calls in real time, helping optimize campaigns for actual patient conversions. Our clients’ top pick?

Liine
Patient Prism
Invoca

By integrating these tools, you can:
✔ Track and categorize calls by intent (appointments vs. inquiries).

 ✔ Filter out unqualified leads before they enter your pipeline.

 ✔ Send conversion data back to Google Ads and other platforms to improve campaign targeting.
The result? More high-value patient leads, better budget allocation, and smarter algorithm training. Call tracking isn’t just an optimization tool—it’s a must-have for precision in patient acquisition.
Top Benefits of HIPAA-compliant Call Tracking:



Optimize marketing efforts to conversions while staying compliant
Avoid data loss after tracking pixels are removed
Send offline data (e.g., calls) to analytic platforms for better attribution
Enable full-funnel measurement
Enrich anonymous users with attributes like gender, age, and service needs



Apply Call Insights
If you use a paid call tracking solution, you can filter out unqualified calls from the ad platform. This will train the algorithm to chase conversions based on criteria that you define—instead of Google. 
To refine call quality:

Set a time threshold: Only pass calls 60 seconds or longer to the platform (longer for certain healthcare specialties).
Tag and score calls: Analyze call content to identify patterns in qualified vs. unqualified leads.
Filter out low-value calls: Exclude calls unrelated to patient acquisition, such as billing inquiries, cancellations, or directions.

By prioritizing calls that lead to booked appointments, you send stronger signals to ad platforms, improving bidding efficiency. If too many calls are unqualified, consider removing call extensions from campaigns to reduce wasted spend.


Use Value-based Bidding
Not all conversions are valued the same, and you must ensure that Google Ads understands these nuances in quality. 
Target CPA bidding does not take quality into account; it attempts to source the lowest-cost conversions first and then expands to higher-cost conversions. This often leads to the majority of conversions coming from calls versus from the website or form submissions.
Value-based bidding tells Google what you consider to be the most and least valuable conversion actions. For example, perhaps online bookings are routinely disqualified due to diagnosis mismatch, or leads generated from social media convert into loyal patients with a higher lifetime value. 
In order for the algorithm to respect the values that you set, campaigns must use either Maximize Conversion Value of Target ROAS. After values are assigned to conversion actions, you’ll want to wait approximately six weeks before switching campaigns to a value-based bidding strategy. This will give campaigns a smoother transition as Google Ads learns which conversions are most valuable.

Assign Values to Conversion Actions to Prioritize Different Conversion Types
When there are known differences in the lead-to-sale rate across different conversion types, assign conversion values to conversion actions appropriately. For example, if it is known that the value of an acquisition is $1,000 and 20% of calls become patients while 40% of forms become patients, forms are worth twice each call, and you can assign conversion values appropriately for both calls and forms.
After assigning conversion actions, you should switch to value-based bidding using either Maximize Conversion Value or Target ROAS. These bidding strategies will ensure that the algorithm respects the values you determined for each conversion action.

Leverage New 3rd Party Data Sources in Full-Funnel Strategy
When your ideal audience is a specific niche, 3rd party data sources like Purple Labs or Definitive Healthcare are a great way to access claims and referral data for advanced targeting and audience building. By making use of their specific codes for various procedures, prescriptions, and diagnoses, you can hone in on a narrowly defined audience of your ideal clients based on attributes such as:


By making good use of the above attributes to further refine your targeting, you can create highly customized audiences in programmatic display networks like Meta, Illumin, and StackAdapt as part of your full-funnel strategy. 

Why Are 3rd Party Data Sources Important?
It’s hard to overstate the value of unlocking payor-based strategies by leveraging 3rd party data sources like PurpleLabs and Definitive. Many organizations find that even though their search campaign is driving a decent number of leads, the quality of those leads isn’t as high as they’d like. Leads can be disqualified for various reasons, such as:

No diagnosis
Not clinically suitable
Lack of insurance or insurance not accepted

The benefit of 3rd party data is the ability to take a much more sophisticated approach to reach an audience that has the right plans and the right payors, in addition to the right diagnosis. By digging into the data and focusing on those highest-value prospective patients, taking reimbursement rates into consideration, you can greatly improve the efficiency of your leads. 
For example, imagine that you’re an Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy provider with specific client qualification needs. You only serve children ages 3-6, and they must have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis.
With 3rd party data sources, you can ensure you’re specifically targeting parents of children who have been diagnosed with ASD. You can also layer on Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) as a payor network if you want to ensure the audience you’re targeting has a health plan with ABA therapy coverage.
While there’s no limit to how many leads you can get if you spend infinite money, most of us are doing marketing with a finite budget, and so we want to maximize our return on investment. Lowering cost per lead is part of that equation, but improving lead quality may be even more important and is too often overlooked because it’s not a single dollar figure. By reaching out to the right audience, you can make sure your marketing is as effective as it can be in driving revenue for the organization.
Refine Negative Keyword Lists
A key part of reaching the right patients is not wasting money on reaching out to the wrong patients, and that’s where refining your negative keyword list can help you hone in on your ideal clients. Without a good negative keyword strategy, you’re going to end up serving ads to a lot of irrelevant queries—doubly so if you’re using Google’s default broad matching.
MOPS alignment is crucial for building a negative keyword list, having those conversations with ops to understand not only the ideal client profile but also what are the most common factors in poor-quality leads. Ideally, you want to use negative keywords to filter out those customers before you waste money advertising to them and waste time disqualifying them further down the funnel. 
Negative keywords will prevent your ads from being shown to people who search for the terms you define as negative. For example, if you are a dentistry practice that does not sell safe sex supplies, you might want to appear in searches for “dental repair” but have a negative keyword for the phrase “dental dam.” 
There is some flexibility in negative keywords, allowing you to choose how wide a net you wish to cast around the key phrases to avoid: 

Broad match negative keywords will keep your ads away from any searches that contain the keywords in any order, useful if you want to avoid an entire category of searches.
Phrase match negative keywords will only stop ads for searches with the designated keywords in that order, so a negative phrase match for “free dental” will keep your ad from showing up when someone searches “Free dental cleanings”, but it may still appear when someone searches “dental cleanings for free”. 
Exact match negative keywords only stop the exact keyword phrase with no additional words, useful when you want to avoid a very specific search string.

Assembling a negative keyword list can be just as difficult as assembling a positive keyword list. And like positive keywords, your negative lists will include different keywords aimed at different parts of the funnel. Ask yourself (and your operations team and your call tracking data) what most frequently disqualifies a lead at each step of the way. And don’t be afraid to think outside the box— e.g., if you’re targeting a certain regional or age demographic, you can use negative keywords to remove searches common to the groups you’re trying to avoid.
Geofence with 3P Data Sources
The more you understand about your ideal client profile, the more ways you can target your marketing to reach them. This is when you want to dig deep into your data and find out what your ideal clients have in common: 

Who do they work for? 
Where do they shop? 
What type of insurance do they have?

These are all questions to which the answers can be combined with available demographic targeting to reach more qualified audiences. Insurance can be an especially useful data point to consider, not only because insurance that covers your service is something that makes leads much more likely to convert, but because insurance type can be relatively easy to target with 3rd party platforms.

We saw this with a client who wanted to reach more patients who had dental coverage that’s standard through Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS). We used Stack Adapt to target BCBS buyers directly, and then we made use of geofencing around federal buildings to tap into the federal insurance health benefits that include BCBS. We also used location-based audiences with a 7-day look-back window for offices with BCBS-covered employees.
The result of all this geofencing? A campaign designed specifically to reach the people whose BCBS insurance would cover their dental work and a much higher conversion rate than previous campaigns. The ability to use geofencing to get very specific about the types of clients you want to reach is a powerful tool that you should leverage.
Test New Ad Units & Features
Facebook’s Instant Form Feature
Once you’ve hit the wall in terms of demand capture, the next step is expanding into full-funnel advertising that uses social media to build brand awareness. This lets you generate new demand by reaching users who are interested but not actively searching. Social ads can be a valuable tool, but targeting is no longer perfectly precise, as HIPAA and other privacy regulations have limited how much information you get upfront about each user.
The solution? Facebook’s Instant Lead Forms let you immediately ask the questions that will qualify or disqualify your leads right in the platform people are using. These forms are robust, allowing for custom questions, conditional logic, and gated content. This allows you to build authority by sharing educational content with consumers who have healthcare concerns.
Instant forms can also be sent directly to users who have shown interest in interacting with your video campaign. By retargeting users who have already engaged with video, and then using Instant forms to qualify leads and generate referrals, we’ve seen organizations lower cost per referral by ~40%, putting social at a comparable level with search campaigns targeting bottom-of-funnel keywords.

Enhanced Conditional Logic – Lead Forms 
Perhaps the best feature of Facebook’s instant forms is their ability to employ conditional logic, which shows users different pages or questions depending on how they answered the previous question. This prevents users who are disqualified from reaching the final stage of lead form submission, ensuring that the leads you capture through social media are of high quality.
Enhanced lead forms allow you to filter out unqualified candidates, which is essential for specialties like ABA therapy with narrow ideal patient profiles. You can ask whether the client is in the preferred age range or has the appropriate diagnosis, and then unqualified clients can be directed to a page that explains why you aren’t the correct provider for them. You can even use enhanced lead forms to disqualify based on insurance coverage, as in this example:

Invest in Ad Creative & Promote Your USP
Your healthcare organization can’t be all things to all people, so you need good ad creative promoting your USP to your ideal client base. Generic digital healthcare ads may be common, but they’re not cost-effective, and they drive poor lead quality. It’s not hard to understand why: If you don’t explain what you do, you’re going to get a lot of clicks from people who then realize you don’t offer what they’re looking for. Worse yet, the people who *are* looking for what you offer will never click in the first place, because you haven’t made it clear that they’re your ideal patient.
That’s why it’s important to have strong ad creative that embodies your USP and differentiates you from the wallpaper of generic digital ads. Find engaging ways to put your key message forward with engaging copywriting, compelling graphics, and linked marketing assets like blog posts and testimonials that show your value to your ideal customer.

 
4) Test & Refine
No matter how insightful you think your strategy is or how effective a certain tactical approach may be in general, the only way to know what will help YOUR organization reach the right patients is through rigorous testing. And ideally, you want to do that testing before launching changes across your entire system. A round of early testing can offer valuable insights that will help guide further deployment and investment decisions. 
So, how do you decide what to test? 
We use an evaluation strategy that I think is pretty cool, so cool it’s actually ICE. That stands for Impact, Confidence, and Ease, the three factors we consider when determining which ideas to prioritize. 

Impact: How well will this product or change help reach our business goal? How much of an impact will the feature make on our target KPI?
Confidence: How confident are we that the test will have the impact we desire? What do the action plans look like for each anticipated outcome? What would be the negative impact if the test does not result in positive outcomes?
Ease: What resources will be allocated to this test? Is the allocation worth the investment, given the anticipated impact?

Example: Applying ICE to Media Testing
Focus on the highest-scoring tests first. These deliver the greatest impact with the least risk.
There’s never any shortage of possibilities you could test, so it’s important to focus on the ones that will make the biggest impact and fill a big need, the ones that are most likely to actually achieve their desired results, and the ones that can be implemented with minimal friction.
Testing Ideas to Consider:
While every organization is different, here are a few ideas to help jumpstart your testing strategy:
Channel Testing:

Does PMAX drive incremental patient volume, or does it cannibalize existing search traffic?
Do LSA leads convert into booked appointments at a higher or lower rate than Google Search Ads?
How does expanding into Meta impact bottom-of-funnel conversions? 

Website & Landing Page Optimization

Are your forms optimized for ease of completion on mobile?
Do users drop off at a certain step in the booking process? What happens if you remove a step?
Is testing different CTAs (e.g., “Schedule Now” vs. “See Available Appointments”) leading to better conversions?

Ad Creative & Messaging

Which value propositions resonate most with your target audience?
Are certain ad formats (video, carousel, static images) outperforming others?
How do video ads vs. static image ads compare in terms of engagement?

Scaling Tests Across Your System
Once a test proves successful, it’s time to scale it efficiently:
✔ Expand it across more campaigns or locations while maintaining performance tracking.

✔ Monitor for diminishing returns—what works at a small scale may need adjustments as you expand.

✔ Continue iterating—optimization never stops, even with proven strategies.
Testing isn’t a one-time task—it’s a continuous process of optimization. Even when you find a winning formula, consumer behavior, competitive landscapes, and regulatory factors will shift. The best-performing healthcare marketers are the ones who embrace testing as an ongoing discipline, using real patient data to refine and perfect their approach.

5) Optimize the Patient Experience
Follow Up on Leads to Convert More Leads into Patients
You can improve lead quality considerably by focusing your efforts on lead generation. But no matter how “quality” a lead may seem, the true measure of a lead’s value is whether it converts into a booked appointment. Sometimes quality leads may come in through form-fills or calls but then fail to convert due to friction in the intake process or follow-up from practice operations. 
To that end, the intake process should be monitored in terms of the volume of calls coming in, as well as the quality of follow-up. You might find that messages and calls aren’t getting returned due to staff shortages or a broken process. I’ve seen situations where leads just get lost in the CRM because they’re not tagged properly. As leads advance through the funnel, it’s so important to track progress using your CRM system.
Then there is your lead nurturing. As they say, out of sight, out of mind, especially for healthcare decisions that take a long time (plastic surgery, for example). This is why you need to nurture leads with routine communication. At the very least, new leads ought to be put into bucketed nurture sequences (email or text) that keep your solution top of mind. 
At the end of the day, Google Ads and PPC benchmarks only tell one part of the patient acquisition story. In order to acquire a new patient successfully, you need to deliver a good patient experience and a seamless intake process. For that reason, the root of patient acquisition issues is not actually your Google Ads campaigns but rather the post-click experience your patients go through.
To address that post-click experience, here are a few areas you should audit and optimize:
Streamline Your Online Booking Experience
An important question: Just how easy is it for your patients to book an appointment? Does it take 3 steps or 20? If your answer is closer to the latter, you have an issue. Today’s patients want an effortless booking experience similar to the ones they are now experiencing in retail.
Don’t overlook your online booking experience. An intuitive experience will help patients find the care they need and increase overall campaign performance.
As a first step, reduce the number of steps to complete a booking by doing the following:

Eliminate irrelevant information requests
Make forms easy to use and populate
Optimize appointment forms for mobile

And make sure that your online booking offers a true appointment booking experience. You don’t want your patients submitting a request and then waiting to hear from you. To that end, integrate your online booking with your EHR or PMS to ensure your patients can fully book. If they have to call in to complete a step, you’re only putting up barriers while also increasing patient frustration.
Consider Call Tracking for your Contact Center
Call tracking and analytics software can help you uncover issues that may have historically prevented callers from booking an appointment. Implementing a call tracking and analytics solution can help you improve lead quality and increase conversions and lead volumes.
It can also help identify issues such as:

Poor staff communication
Cumbersome or confusing booking process 
Common objections
Long wait times

With these insights, you can then train your staff to close more leads into booked appointments.
 
Conclusion
In the End, It’s About Narrowing the Focus and Working Smarter
Successful patient acquisition isn’t about casting the widest net—it’s about precision. The strategies in this guide are designed to help you attract the right patients, not just more leads.

Optimize what’s already working: Refine conversion signals, call tracking, and bidding strategies to improve lead quality.
Expand strategically: Test new channels like PMAX, LSAs, and Meta with measured, data-driven experiments before scaling.
Fine-tune continuously: Marketing success isn’t set-it-and-forget-it. Use structured testing and optimization to stay ahead of shifting consumer behavior.





If your lead quality is suffering, the answers are already in your data. The key is knowing where to look—and using the right tools to refine and scale your approach. Focus on smarter targeting, rigorous testing, and continuous optimization, and you’ll drive real, measurable patient growth.

                    The post-pandemic world has brought forth many new changes to the healthcare industry as a whole. Healthcare marketing efforts are evolving rapidly in order to keep up with the current competitive landscape and economic shift. Because patient-centric marketing has become the name of the game, your healthcare organization has got to heavily invest in acquisition-focused marketing strategies to get ahead of the competition. We’ll dive into five patient acquisition strategies to help you fuel growth in 2023.Table of ContentsWhat is Patient Acquisition Marketing?1. Master Local SEO2.

What is Patient Acquisition Marketing?
A patient acquisition marketing campaign aims to persuade potential patients to choose your clinic or hospital for their healthcare needs. To create a successful acquisition campaign, it’s crucial to emphasize the most exceptional features of your medical practice and use them to create an enticing vision of what a new patient will encounter during their visit.
It’s worth noting that patient acquisition strategies are focused on gaining new patients, in contrast to patient retention tactics, which aim to keep them coming back for care.
 
1. Master Local SEO
For ages now, we’ve been telling our healthcare clients that local SEO is an essential component of patient acquisition in the healthcare industry.
“A huge piece for a lot of local businesses is your Google Business Profile. Making sure that you have optimized listings that align with the content that you’re showing on your webpage is huge. That will help Google understand exactly who you are, where you’re located, and what you offer. That’s true for all listings, not just Google. It’s really important to make sure you’re managing that.” —Jacquelyn Green, Director of SEO
Here’s why: people tend to search for and visit healthcare providers that are nearby. Your Austin plastic surgery folks are probably looking to get their nose job done in Austin. And your Atlanta people shopping for a LASIK provider probably want to find a laser located in town. In response to this local demand, Google and other search engines are getting very good at stitching together highly relevant local search experiences.
Use local SEO to rank for the terms your patients are looking for in their area.
Therefore, if this is your first time developing a formal patient acquisition marketing strategy, start with SEO. While SEO tends to be a long-term investment, once done, it is always yours. In the end, effective SEO will turn into a well-oiled machine and continue to drive new patients long into the future.
How to Optimize for Local SEO
When people search locally, they tend to follow through and show up in person. According to Google, 76% of smartphone users who search for things nearby visit a business within 24 hours. That goes for your prospective patients, too. By optimizing your content, business listings, and overall digital presence for one or more local markets, you can make sure you reach them.
At a high level, your objective is to send lots of signals to Google that you’re an active, authoritative, and reputable provider in a given geographic area. While there are a variety of ways to do so, here are a few fundamental parts of a local SEO strategy:

Local citations/Listings: There are more places to list your healthcare practice than just Google Business Profile, Bing Maps, Yelp, and Facebook. You got ZocDoc, Vitals, and other sites managed by different healthcare groups like Sharp and Northwestern Medical. But you’ve got to manage all of them and keep them accurate and up-to-date. And don’t forget, each location needs its own listing and make sure your business name, address, and phone (NAP) are the same across all listings.
Google Business Profile: Having a stellar Google Business Profile is arguably the most important factor when it comes to local SEO. First, set up your GBP listing with a verified address, relevant categories, and thorough details. Then, regularly update your profile by posting photos, videos, and info on new promotions, answering user questions, and sharing operational updates. Don’t forget to stay on top of your Google Reviews too!
Location-specific pages and content: Healthcare organizations need to have different web pages for each location, no excuses! The idea is to make it super easy for patients to find what they need for their specific location with minimal clicks. Create pages for each location that include useful information for both your patients and the search engines. Include relevant keywords, make UX a priority, have distinct URLs, and create a scalable template that can be used for each location.
Locally relevant backlinks: When authoritative websites link back to your location-specific web pages, it tells Google’s algorithm that your website is both reliable and helpful. Local directories provide a simple and free method to publish NAP (name, address, phone number) information for various locations while also gaining valuable backlinks. Partnering with local industry-related websites, publications, and media to create content is also a great way to build your backlink portfolio.

If you want to rank in Google’s Map Pack for relevant local searches, you need a well-optimized and engaging GMB.
The idea is to cover these bases for each of your locations. By consistently churning out this kind of rich local content, healthcare organizations supply search engines with all kinds of information to surface in all kinds of local search experiences, including:

Map searches
“Near me” searches
Search engine results pages (SERPs)

Even healthcare marketing experts like Paul Gruensfelder, Vice President of Marketing, Select Dental Management are shifting their focus to local SEO in 2023. “Obviously, where you rank on the page is really important, but [Google] maps is super important. We’re in a local business, we provide a local service, and I would tell you, that’s where I want to be primarily.”

2. Boost Search Visibility with Google Ads
However, most healthcare businesses cannot wait six to twelve months for a longer-term SEO strategy to start creating bottom-line value. That is why paid search goes hand-in-hand with a mature SEO program to attract new patients.
When configured properly, PPC advertising can begin generating new patient leads as soon as they’re launched. Dominating the top half of the SERP, paid search helps healthcare providers gain search share in competitive markets and supports areas where your organic SEO is yet to be built.
For instance, say you want to increase the ranking for a competitive local keyword, but aren’t seeing immediate results. With PPC, you can slap an advertisement at the top of that SERP above the organic results while continuing to build your organic rankings.
Google Ads helps you gain visibility on SERPs for competitive keywords.
How to Increase Patient Acquisition with PPC Campaigns
By placing your information at the right time, on the very top of the page, and in front of the right people, you can land a new patient, appointment, booking, and so on as soon as your campaign goes live. However, how do you know if you’re doing it right?
The fact is, even advanced marketers often use outdated best practices because of how rapidly Google is developing its technology. Within the past few years, Google’s machine learning and AI enhancement, alongside their continued emphasis on consumer experience have drastically changed how PPC works. By combining automation with creative messaging and end-to-end strategies, you can continually perfect your patient acquisition strategy in 2023.
“I think agencies and marketers should be excited about the fact that Google has taken that on because now they can focus on other things. The more strategic things. Like, am I saying the right things to my users in my messaging? Do I understand the buying decision?
Am I reinforcing motivations? Am I removing hurdles? Am I tackling the anxiety and friction? Do I have a great landing page? Am I testing landing pages and ad copy? These are all things that are not going anywhere that allow agencies and in-house marketing teams to flex their marketing chops and be a lot more strategic.” —Rich Briddock, SVP Strategy & Analytics, Cardinal
Meanwhile, below are a few things to keep in mind:

With machine learning developments, the old, rigid way of optimizing for keywords is becoming less efficient. Today’s ad campaigns must connect and engage with audiences by serving up the perfect solution at the right moment, and it goes so much more than throwing web page links into one big ad and straight entering a bidding war.
The future is broad match. Google is encouraging the use of automation and AI in its advertising solutions, leading to the decline of traditional “exact match” and exposing the limitations of other keyword matching options. Advertisers must adapt to these changes by using “broad match” type in their campaigns to stay up to date. 
Responsive Search Ads (RSAs) are now the default. By showing patients the most relevant ad copy, RSAs can significantly improve campaign performance and ROIs. While many healthcare providers previously relied on expanded text ads, starting June 30, 2022, responsive search ads will be the only Search ad type allowed in standard search campaigns. So, now is the time to get familiar with RSAs!
Performance Max Campaigns are a new way to buy across channels, including YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, and more. Since it’s considered the next-gen solution for local campaigns, it is vital that healthcare providers take full advantage of Performance Max Campaigns to attract local patients.

Therefore, if you’re currently leveraging Google Ads for patient acquisition, it’s worth conducting an audit before implementing any new strategy. With most healthcare marketers using sophisticated automated bidding strategies to keep CPA down and control ad spending, a comprehensive audit will show you how to optimize what you have and make up for what you’re missing when it comes to patient acquisition with PPC campaigns.

3. Use Paid Social for Patient Acquisition
Social media works. However, when it comes to online patient acquisition, you must pick and choose and spend your budget wisely.
Don’t get us wrong. We love social. But we don’t recommend investing in social media unless you’ve established a solid SEO and PPC foundation. Once you’ve maximized your organic and paid search effort, then it’s time to move onto social media, specifically Facebook and Instagram.
The best thing about these social channels is how they provide various ways to listen to and engage with your audience. That’s why many healthcare businesses leverage social media as their primary branding platform.
There, they steadily publish a variety of content, including educational videos, Facebook Live, Instagram Reels, video testimonials, and other information to provide value to their audience and create rich engagement. This kind of living, breathing, and growing Facebook presence is a powerful way to increase brand awareness and strengthen brand affinity.
Nonetheless, while your potential patients are indeed on Facebook and Instagram, simply bringing yourself in front of the audience is not enough to generate immediate leads. You must marry performance marketing with branding if you want your social media strategy to drive patient acquisition.

Like we’ve mentioned earlier, paid social has its merit. Compared to long-term SEO, a proper Facebook advertising strategy can deliver results much more quickly, although not as fast as PPC. However, for Facebook ads to work, a full-funnel strategy is a must.
So, what is a full-funnel advertising strategy?
As the name indicates, a full-funnel strategy tailors your campaign messaging according to each stage in your customer journey. It is a comprehensive strategy that covers TOF, MOF, and BOF, from an audience who just started showing interest to those about to convert.
Facebook Ads can help you increase your practice’s visibility and build brand awareness.
Because a full-funnel strategy walks your target audience through the journey, it can often reduce the overall cost to generate a lead at the bottom of the funnel.
To build a successful full-funnel strategy, pay attention to the following:

Brand Awareness: Leverage campaigns targeting the TOF audience to increase your overall brand awareness. Integrate your paid ads strategy with your organic social media content to attract potential prospects and initiate their patient journey. When costs are cheap, it’s a good time to invest in TOF efforts, granted you have maximized your Google Ads performance.
Message Tailoring: It’s common sense. You can’t use the same message on an awareness stage audience and a conversion stage audience. Tailoring your messaging, which includes your ad copy, creatives, and CTA based on your audience’s customer journey stage will significantly increase your CTR and engagement.
Retargeting: A full-funnel strategy walks alongside your future patient, meaning they keep your brand visible in front of them at all decision-making moments. By retargeting website visitors, app users, or people who have engaged with you on social media, you can reinforce engagement the with MOF audience. Because privacy restrictions and data regulations have changed the digital marketing landscape, you’re going to have a lot less information to base your retargeting campaigns on. Nonetheless, you can still gain deep insights by talking to patients, using A/B testing, focusing on contextual advertising, and using call tracking data.
Diversify Ad Types: Today’s ad format goes beyond simple photos and videos. As the platform continues to develop, businesses can now incorporate carousels, lead generation forms, unique mobile experiences, even augmented reality!
Make Conversion Easy: Make sure conversion is easy throughout your campaign, whether it’s a click to a landing page, a button to follow, or a direct Facebook Experience. Remember, the end goal of your Facebook ads is to increase patient volume.

 
4. Build a Website Patients Love
In the end, your goal is to increase your patient volume. Whether a patient called the number on your PPC ad or made an online appointment, you can guarantee that at some point they’ve landed on your website, which is why the strategies we’ve talked about above cannot reach their full potential without a responsive, friendly, and optimized website.
In other words, your website is the centerpiece of your patient acquisition strategy. On one hand, your website is your main communication channel with search engines, allowing you to be seen by the many users seeking a health solution. On the other hand, your website is the digital front desk that will either welcome your future patients with a warm smile or turn them away immediately. Therefore, you want to make sure your website creates a simple, seamless experience for your prospective and existing patients both.
Ask yourself these questions:

Does your site navigation make sense? Can patients easily find what they need?
Are all important, valuable information presented right at the beginning?
Can your site load fast and properly on all devices?
Is the content on your site timely and authoritative?

If you answered no for any of these questions, it’s time to create a better web experience for your patients. After all, it is people—not marketing dollars or campaign metrics—that make up for your patient volume. Therefore, let your patients guide your acquisition marketing strategies, whether that means finding an easier online scheduling tool or optimizing for local listings.
How to Build a Solid, Scalable Website Foundation
It is crucial to prioritize your digital presence in today’s technology-driven world. If your website is outdated, slow, or visually unappealing, this will discourage patients from taking the next steps with your practice.
Your website needs to be scalable and allow you to easily add new acquisitions. Many website development agencies create clunky content management systems or separate WordPress sites, which can be difficult and costly to manage and scale. 
At Cardinal, we use a modular framework to develop our websites on WordPress that keeps the same page structure, information hierarchy, and functionality across all websites, but still allows for customization at the brand level. This approach provides a consistent experience across all brand websites within the platform, while still maintaining brand identity through visual differentiation. By avoiding building new websites from scratch with every acquisition, you can save time and money while still maintaining a strong online presence.
SEO also plays an important part in how your website is structured. To create a solid base, and to make sure your content shows up in organic search, it’s important to follow the best practices in technical, SEO, and UX. This can be achieved through a thorough website audit that will:

Evaluate SEO health and performance
Assess the mobile experience and speed metrics
Examine the online scheduling process
Identify technical red flags and information architecture improvement areas
Evaluate the design and UX
Analyze content quality, relevance, and freshness

 
5. Take Control of Your Digital Reputation
None of the strategies listed above will work if you don’t have a strong digital reputation. People take their healthcare needs seriously. Before making healthcare decisions, they go online to research their options, evaluate providers, and read reviews. Your online reputation influences their perception of your brand and determines if they’ll choose your healthcare organization. Your digital reputation is too important to neglect.
Amplify your brand’s positive reviews And build trust with these digital reputation management strategies:
Develop a Review Solicitation Strategy:
To effectively gather patient reviews and testimonials, identify the points in the patient journey where you can ask for feedback. Consider including a survey link in automated emails or soliciting reviews via text message or mobile app. Train staff to ask for reviews in a normalized way, and automate the process using reputation management tools like BirdEye. Don’t overlook the opportunity to solicit reviews through snail mail by providing a link or QR code in personalized letters or reminders. By implementing these strategies, you can continuously improve and monitor your digital reputation.
Respond to Reviews:
Responding to reviews shows that you value customer feedback and care about their experience. This can build trust and credibility with potential customers who are researching your business online. You’ll need a plan for responding to negative reviews in a way that is polite, and respectful no matter what the patient says. For positive reviews, especially those from customer champions, seize the opportunity to respond personally with gratitude and acknowledgment of your team. Incorporate those reviews into your social media, website, and other digital channels.
Build an Engaging About Us Page:
The About Us page on your website provides a unique chance to showcase your practice’s expertise, history, and reputation to your patients. It’s an opportunity to humanize your brand by sharing your story and introducing the people behind the practice. You can even include a mission statement and values that reflect the quality of care you provide. Neglecting this page is a common mistake, as it is often the first stop for patients seeking to learn more about your practice. Make sure your About Us page is engaging and informative to leave a lasting impression!
Enhance Your Website with Client Testimonials:
A testimonial is more than just a review – it’s proof that there are still good people in the world who appreciate what you do. If you want to get testimonials for your business, ask your clients to leave a few words about their experience. Then, pick the best ones to put on your website’s landing pages. That way, when people are checking out your business, they can see all the nice things others have said about you.
At Cardinal, we feature client testimonials throughout our website. We also have a landing page dedicated solely to testimonials.

Optimize BOF Campaigns to Cut Costs
The current economic climate may be causing marketing budgetary concerns. If your marketing budget is tight, focus on fully optimizing BOF strategies like PPC and cutting ineffective campaigns. Do this by:

Refining Keyword Strategy – Make sure to prioritize high-intent keywords to capture BOF patients actively searching for a solution.
Optimizing Landing Pages – Enhance the user experience with relevant landing pages. These must be informative and answer patients’ top questions.
Upping Your Ad Game – Your messaging and ad copy forms the foundation of any Google PPC strategy. Therefore, you must have relevant, quality ad copy with a solid CTA and supportive information to capture those seeking immediate answers.
Re-Evaluating Your Bid Strategy – Since healthcare service providers use Google ad campaigns to capture BOF leads, you should focus bidding on maximizing impression and conversion rate. The most effective solution is combining manual and automatic bidding.
Taking Advantage of Remarketing Campaigns – Google allows users to build remarketing lists for search ads, combining standard and dynamic remarketing. By building a list, you can then serve a specific ad to a list of visitors demonstrating similar behaviors during past interactions.
Measure Performance More Efficiently – Don’t neglect your analytics and reporting process. For one, the more clarity you gain from past data, the more effectively you can optimize your campaigns to provide the desired user experience.

 
Measure the Success of Your Patient Acquisition Efforts
Having an effective marketing analytics framework is essential for your patient acquisition strategy. Building a centralized tech stack will allow you to integrate brands quickly but also give you the most insights on performance, so you can tailor your acquisition strategy based on what’s working.

Customer Record Management System (CRM): To manage patient acquisition and improve visibility into the acquisition pipeline, we recommend using Salesforce. It’s HIPAA compliant, integrates easily with reporting tools, ad platforms, and marketing automation systems, and is considered the gold standard for CRMs in healthcare.
Tracking and Analytics: We use integrations with Salesforce and Ruler to centralize and optimize data analytics for marketing campaigns, enabling better tracking and measurement of ROI.
Call Tracking: Our preferred vendors for call tracking are Liine and CallRail, which offer technical integrations, data accessibility, and easy pixel implementation to track calls and conversions.
Reputation and List Management: For managing online reputation and listings, we suggest using Yext or Podium programs. These programs offer listing cleanup and review generation programs to help improve online visibility and reputation management.

“Call tracking is usually the most important piece of tracking for our clients because most of our clients get phone calls. You get online appointments, you do get form submissions, you do get live chat appointments, but the majority is going to be phone calls.” – Rich Briddock, SVP of Strategy & Analytics 
 
Putting These Patient Acquisition Strategies Into Play
At the end of the day, you really want to stay firmly focused on fulfilling your patients’ needs, because that’s really what you need to drive growth for your healthcare organization.
“I would say the only thing that I constantly think about is just meeting the patients where they are. I think the more that we as like a medical community, whether it’s as marketers, or as doctors can show them that, “We’re actually here for you. We hear you.” We can do that before they even step in the office with content and show who we are and do that with our marketing efforts.”  —Theresa Porcaro, Marketing Director, Pelvic Rehabilitation Medicine

We step up for our fellow Flockers and make sure the team always shines first.

                            We begin by questioning all assumptions—Flockers don’t take things at face value. We analyze, dissect ideas, and operate our minds like puzzle-solving machines.

                            Friction ignites growth so we are always open to discussion about better ways forward, we just expect it to be done respectfully. No kissing ass, no egos, and no empire building. We say what we mean.

                            We take ownership of what we do and fulfill our commitments—respect dealt straightforward. We know mistakes are a part of learning and growth if they’re shared with transparency.

                                                            Some say Alex Membrillo was born to be the CEO of a digital marketing agency focused on growing multi-location companies. Others say the Flock chose him. Together with his outstanding team of high-flyers, Alex has led Cardinal to the promised land. Awards proudly include A Best Place to Work designation and a  spot on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing privately-held US companies for three years running. 
And yes, a closet-sized office just past the foosball table by the restrooms.  
Having once tasted the bright lights and stardom that comes with being named a Digital Marketer of the Year by the Technology Association of Georgia (TAG), Alex is no stranger to the spotlight. He’s a Forbes Agency Council writer with placements in leading national publications including Entrepreneur, Search Engine Journal, Physicians Practice, and The Wall Street Journal. He has also served as an expert speaker for conferences including the American Marketing Association, SouthWired, SMASH Senior Care Marketing & Sales Summit,  Vistage Executive Leaders,  SHSMD, and HCIC. 
More importantly—and beyond all the credentials and cool accolades—Cardinal has experienced exponential growth under Membrillo’s leadership. His innovative approach to digital marketing has transformed the industry, especially the world of healthcare and private equity. His team is also growing in lockstep with his client portfolio, the two groups of people he lives to serve (alongside his loving family, of course).

                                                            Alex is a brand marketing maestro with more than a decade of experience creating high-impact campaigns that drive growth, boost revenue, and make healthcare brands shine. She has worked across industries including complex care pharmaceuticals, assisted living and memory care, orthodontia, and dentistry—partnering with clients to deliver innovative, results-driven strategies that exceed expectations.
With a knack for turning challenges into opportunities (and a dash of Southern sass), Alex thrives in every stage of the marketing process, from developing bold strategies to crafting compelling ad copy. She’s known for her creative problem-solving, ability to connect with clients, and versatility across both digital and traditional channels. Her work not only delivers measurable results but also builds lasting relationships and inspires teams.
When she’s not optimizing brand-boosting campaigns or leading strategy sessions, Alex can be found enjoying the golfer’s dream life in Augusta, GA with her husband, or spoiling her sweet Golden Retriever, Gussie. A former New Orleans resident, she’ll admit nothing beats a fresh beignet—though she’s found plenty of Southern charm to love in her new hometown.

At Cardinal, Andrés is energized by learning from a team that speaks his SEO language and shares his passion for experimentation, problem-solving, and growth.

Andrés is driven by curiosity, creativity, and the belief that every improvement helps businesses make stronger connections with the audiences they serve. With a growing focus on technical SEO, he approaches challenges with an open mind and a commitment to learning something new from every project.
Outside of work, Andrés is a devoted pop-music fan (especially anything from the 2000s), a Nintendo enthusiast, and an avid watcher of YouTube deep-dives. He loves bar trivia and will never turn down a good karaoke night.

                                                            Bailey brings a people-first mindset shaped by her background in hospitality, communications, and event planning. With experience in hotels and large-scale events, she has seen firsthand how strong branding, thoughtful storytelling, and exceptional service can transform customer experiences. 
At Cardinal, Bailey is passionate about the opportunity to blend her hospitality foundation with her growing enthusiasm for marketing strategy and execution. She’s energized by roles that require collaboration, creativity, and purpose. What motivates Bailey most is the drive to exceed expectations, the same determination that led to her rapid promotion in a previous role. She’s excited to bring that same dedication to helping Cardinal foster a supportive, engaged, and high-performing team environment.
Outside of work, Bailey enjoys walking and engaging in her community, working out, taking pottery classes, cooking and cleaning, and most of all: traveling!

                                                            Carolina (Caro, as we call her)  joined the Flock with a solid background of 4 years in digital marketing and 6 years in marketing overall. She is detail and goal-oriented with a flair for digital strategy, problem-solving, and making data-driven decisions.
Caro is well-versed in navigating multiple platforms, including TikTok, Pinterest, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more. She has extensive experience in healthcare marketing, having worked both on the agency side and with reputable healthcare brands. This exposure has equipped her with valuable insights into crafting effective messaging and targeted designs tailored to the specific needs of the healthcare industry. What motivates Caro to continually improve performance and achieve better results is her fascination with understanding user behavior. Instead of seeking a one-size-fits-all solution, she focuses on providing personalized experiences based on individual preferences and interactions. 
When she isn’t working, Caro enjoys spending time with her dogs by the pool and indulges in her passion for dancing. Exploring the world is also close to her heart, as she frequently embarks on short weekend trips, ensuring she makes the most of her time and cherishes life’s adventures.

                                                            Carolina joined the Flock with six years of experience in paid media, specializing in search, social and programmatic campaigns. With a strong background in hospitality, she’s passionate about helping brands connect with people in meaningful, thoughtful ways. 
At Cardinal, Carolina is energized by the opportunity to take greater strategic ownership, collaborate with a team of sharp minds, and develop strong, trust-based relationships with clients. She’s naturally curious and analytical—always looking for patterns, insights, and innovative approaches to drive performance and real-world impact. Carolina finds the greatest reward in helping people find the support and information they need to take care of themselves.
Outside the office, Carolina is always planning her next trip, attending dancing events or learning languages. She’s also the kind of person who thinks in memes, and somehow always knows where north is.

                                                            Cynthia is an SEO Specialist who brings four years of experience in content strategy and search optimization, with a strong foundation in writing that shapes how she understands audience behavior and intent. She has supported a wide range of healthcare organizations, including dental groups, cancer clinics, behavioral health centers, and wellness providers. She has a history of creating high-performing content that helps patients find the care they need.
Growing up in a family of doctors, Cynthia saw how difficult navigating healthcare can be. That perspective fuels her passion for making information clearer, more accessible, and more helpful. She’s driven by the impact her work can have on patients and by the satisfaction of continually improving processes, tools, and results for her team.
Outside of work, Cynthia enjoys spinning classes, cheladas with extra salt, and watching old movies and sitcoms.

                                                            Lena is a marketing and communications pro with over a decade of experience in a wide variety of industries ranging from healthcare and higher education to spirits, “smart” socks and enterprise security software. Her diverse background includes roles in media relations, organic social media management, copywriting, content creation, account management, paid media strategy, and general marketing strategy.
This wide range of experience allows Lena to approach goals and problems with a breadth of unique perspectives. At Cardinal, Len is looking forward to taking a proactive, collaborative and creative approach to achieve client and agency goals, learn new industries and connect people with the healthcare services they need. 
Born in Orlando, FL, Lena’s education, career and family life led her to Gainesville, FL; Nashville, TN; and Jacksonville, FL  before returning to Orlando to put down roots with her husband, two dogs and one-year-old daughter. Outside of work, Lena enjoys spending time with her family, scouting out the best places to get specialty craft beer and coffee, trying new recipes and restaurants, being outside (when Florida’s weather allows), and catching up on new books for her monthly book club with friends.

                                                            Leonardo is a paid media specialist with eight years of experience in marketing and advertising, with a deep focus on PPC. He has worked across agencies and in-house roles, managing campaigns for a wide range of industries, including urgent care clinics and ENT practices. Known for his data-driven approach, Leonardo excels at full-funnel PPC strategy across Google and Meta, advanced GA4 and GTM analysis, and ongoing CRO testing to uncover new opportunities and drive measurable growth.
At Cardinal, Leonardo is passionate about the work he does because it aligns directly with his values. After managing marketing for a university and later running PPC for healthcare clients in Canada, he found purpose in work that genuinely impacts people’s lives. For him, performance marketing becomes far more meaningful when it helps someone find answers, solutions, or access to care. 
What drives Leonardo is the challenge of solving problems, finding smarter optimizations, and consistently exceeding expectations. He loves digging into data, identifying opportunities others might miss, and building strategies that help businesses scale in a meaningful way.
Outside of work, Leonardo enjoys low-key nights watching movies on the couch, spending time with his dog, going out to dinner with his wife, and fitting in some gaming whenever he can. And yes—he’ll happily tell the story behind his old “Leo Glasses” nickname.

                                                            Lucas is your go-to guy for all things SEO. He’s just crazy about it! At Cardinal, he’s pumped to take his SEO game to the next level and make a real splash in the digital world.
With three years of SEO wizardry under his belt, Lucas is all about crunching numbers and diving deep into data. He’s like a detective, but instead of solving crimes, he’s cracking the code of search engines. While healthcare marketing is new turf for Lucas, he’s stoked about the idea of making patients’ lives easier. Imagine finding the right doc or getting a timely diagnosis without all the hassle. That’s the dream!
Outside the digital realm, Lucas is a man of many talents and interests. He’s a whiz in the kitchen, loves pumping iron at the gym, and can grapple with the best of them on the BJJ mats. But that’s not all—he’s also a tabletop RPG aficionado, a WoW raider extraordinaire, and a movie buff who can appreciate everything from Oscar winners to cheesy action flicks. Lucas knows how to live life to the fullest, on and offline!

                                                            Macarena is a multimedia designer with five years of experience creating visuals that connect and inspire. At Cardinal, she channels her passion for combining creativity with purpose, transforming ideas into branding, motion graphics, and digital content that drive impact. She thrives on clear communication, collaboration, and tackling creative challenges with focus and precision.
While her design career hasn’t been exclusively in healthcare, Macarena brings unique insight from her experience as an English-Spanish interpreter in medical settings. This background deepened her understanding of patient communication and the importance of clarity, which she now applies to every healthcare marketing project. She’s quick to adapt to new industries and always takes time to understand the audience and message behind her work.
Outside of work, Macarena enjoys playing sports, spending time with friends, meeting new people, and exploring places that inspire her love of art.

                                                            Maya Koziol is an SEO Manager with four years of experience in search engine optimization. She began her professional SEO career as an SEO & Content Marketing Associate for a digital marketing agency, was quickly promoted to SEO Specialist, and then moved on to be the SEO Specialist at an Orthodontic Support Organization (OSO) for two years, all while completing her Masters in Communications with a Specialization in Advertising from S.I. Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University, which she graduated with in May 2023. 
At Cardinal, Maya identifies with the organization’s mission because she is committed to providing clients with exceptional SEO results that allow them to connect patients to the care they need. She is driven by the challenge of staying ahead in the ever-changing digital marketing environment and loves that SEO allows her to constantly learn and grow as a professional.
Maya’s interest in healthcare stems from her family of nurses and her passion for helping others. She loves seeing her clients succeed as she knows the measurable outcomes she drives for them ultimately help their patients.
Outside of her professional life, Maya loves to read and also considers herself a TV enthusiast. She can often be found at a concert, traveling, or spending quality time at home with her fiancè, dog and two cats.

She is deeply passionate about her role and cherishes the opportunity to continuously learn and grow in the dynamic world of paid media. Her work at Cardinal is driven by her desire to build strong, caring relationships with clients.
Mechi strives to achieve better results because she understands the profound impact her efforts have on clients and, ultimately, the people in need of their services. The satisfaction of making clients happy and contributing to the well-being of others is a key motivator for her.. Being able to play a part in improving health and overall well-being by effectively promoting her clients’ offerings at the right time and place fills her with excitement and a sense of purpose.
Outside of the office, Mechi enjoys attending concerts, binge-watching the heartwarming series “This Is Us” (which she has watched twice already!). Most importantly, she values spending quality time with friends and family eating Argentinian asado.

With four years of immersive experience in website development, she has honed her skills and embraces a meticulous approach to her work.

For Mina, healthcare marketing represents a departure from the typical use of marketing tactics for potentially toxic purposes. Being part of a team that promotes something as essential and positive as healthcare brings her a profound sense of fulfillment.

                                                            Oriana Fanelli is a multidisciplinary marketer and storyteller with over 7 years of experience across agency and in-house roles in both Latin America and the U.S. She’s developed and led campaigns for a wide range of brands, from financial institutions and e-commerce companies to lifestyle and entertainment businesses. She is an expert at blending creative storytelling with performance-driven strategy to deliver meaningful results.
At Cardinal, Oriana thrives at the intersection of data and creativity. She’s passionate about building strategies that solve complex challenges, resonate with audiences, and drive measurable impact. She believes in the power of empathy and curiosity to uncover insights, optimize performance, and craft marketing that connects on both rational and emotional levels.
When she’s not creating campaigns to help people find the healthcare services they need, Oriana can be found holed up reading fantasy and emotionally intense books (normally a 600-page book in one sitting). She also enjoys watching and ranking films on Letterboxd, attending dance classes, planning elaborate travels, and doting on cats.

                                                            Peter Traña is a seasoned Paid Media Supervisor with over 12 years of hands-on experience in digital marketing. Throughout his career, he has successfully managed campaigns across nearly every paid platform, including Google Ads, Meta, and Amazon. Whether he’s refining keyword strategies, optimizing product feeds, or crafting audience profiles, Peter brings a data-first mindset and a passion for performance to every initiative.
At Cardinal, Peter is driven by one core mission: ensuring every ad dollar delivers measurable value. Peter goes beyond just clicks and focuses on the full picture, not only driving bottom-of-the-funnel traffic, but also nurturing top-of-the-funnel prospects to maintain a pool of warm audiences ready to convert.
Peter finds healthcare marketing especially rewarding because it allows him to connect people with trusted services that can improve their well-being. For him, success isn’t just about performance, it’s about purpose.
Outside of work, Peter can be found grilling over charcoal, tackling mountain bike trails, or lifting weights. He’s also a proud Office binge-watcher and a master of parallel parking.

                                                            Richard Accardi, is a seasoned professional with a passion for making impactful connections between patients and diverse provider partners. With over 11 years of experience in Account Services, he brings a wealth of expertise in lead generation and retention marketing to the table. While healthcare isn’t within his previous scope, his extensive background underscores his ability to drive successful marketing strategies.
Richard’s enthusiasm stems from the opportunity to create a difference in people’s lives by fostering relationships between patients and various healthcare providers. However, his ultimate passion lies in mentoring and guiding his exceptional team. Richard thrives on collaborating with his team, strategizing marketing initiatives, and navigating problem-solving challenges, finding fulfillment in their collective accomplishments. The driving force behind Richard’s pursuit of excellence is a potent blend of ambition, caffeine, and an insatiable curiosity. He believes in constantly pushing boundaries and surpassing his own expectations, finding satisfaction in the moments where he can proudly say, “I nailed that!” For Richard, healthcare marketing represents more than promoting products; it’s about positively impacting lives.
Outside of the office, Richard enjoys spending time with his family. When he’s not with them, he immerses himself in DIY home projects. Despite the time it may take, the sense of achievement he feels upon completing them, like constructing a bench for the mudroom, is immensely gratifying.

                                                            Rick is a seasoned digital marketing leader with over 12 years of experience driving lead generation, multi-channel campaigns, and ROI-focused strategies for healthcare and mission-driven brands. His career began with grassroots social media marketing for a regional network of asthma and allergy clinics, where he built a strong foundation in digital brand development and patient outreach. 
He went on to lead large-scale campaigns with multi-million-dollar budgets and served as project lead for a careers-focused website redesign for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. His data-driven, full-funnel approach consistently delivers measurable growth and improved patient access.
At Cardinal, he applies his expertise in Paid Search, Paid Social, SEO, CRO, and Email Marketing to help healthcare providers grow their businesses while connecting patients with the right care for their individual needs.
Passionate about bridging the gap between technology, innovation, and human connection, Rick draws inspiration from his upbringing as the child of a healthcare provider. Outside of work, he’s an art history enthusiast, devoted Chelsea FC supporter, rare bourbon collector, and proud dad of two. You can also find him on the green attempting to play good golf, badly.

                                                            Tara joined the Flock with an already strong background in digital marketing! Upon earning her Bachelors in Mass Communications from the University of Delaware, she entered the wide world of advertising at an agency in Charleston.
Tara’s passion for digital marketing has allowed her to build great client relationships. In addition, it has helped her work with cross-functional teams at Cardinal to create innovative strategies that maximize performance. With business owners running in her family, she is incredibly passionate about driving client success.
The most rewarding part of her work at Cardinal is seeing our healthcare groups thrive due to our efforts!
Outside the office, Tara enjoys cooking, trying new restaurants, and hanging out with her furry pals, Toast and Butter. It’s safe to say, she’s got food on the brain. Did we mention, she runs a successful foodstagram account (@charleston_foodie) with 26k followers? Taco ‘bout dedication!

                                                            Taylor is an accomplished Account Director with a career spanning over six years in the marketing landscape. Having begun her career in healthcare, she brings a unique perspective to her role at Cardinal. Taylor understands that healthcare marketing goes beyond business; it’s about connecting people to vital care. 
As an Account Director, Taylor thrives on helping clients achieve their goals. She is driven by the dual excitement of assisting clients in reaching their objectives and exploring innovative strategies in the dynamic realm of digital marketing. What sets her apart is her genuine enthusiasm for reporting and strategy. She finds immense satisfaction in presenting clients with insights into their digital marketing efforts and witnessing their excitement as they see tangible results. 
Outside of the office, Taylor leads an active life  and she can often be found at the gym with friends. She also enjoys the great outdoors, embarking on walks and hikes with her boxer mix, Beasley, and her husband, Josh. And when it’s time to unwind, she indulges in the guilty pleasure of watching hilariously terrible horror movies from the comfort of her couch.

As the leader of Cardinal’s analytics team, Turner develops integrated reporting capabilities that give healthcare brands visibility into the performance and impact of their marketing investment. The work he does researching emerging markets and provider density is critical in ensuring organizations are making informed decisions regarding acquisitions or opening new practices. 
When he isn’t analyzing data, Turner spends his time painting miniatures for board games and playing bass guitar. He also enjoys wings, hot lemonyaki (a hot lemon pepper/teriyaki combination) wings in particular. Fun fact: Turner used to be a chicken wing delivery driver and got his first agency job by networking after making a delivery to their office!

                Whether you’re building your digital marketing program from scratch or ditching an old agency that didn’t quite deliver, working with a new digital marketing agency can ignite a lot of questions.


“Will I be heard and my needs understood?”
“What kind of results can I expect?”
“How often will I receive updates?”
“What do their reports look like?”
“What happens if things don’t work out as planned?”


            
        

        
        
        
            
                These are all great questions, and here are our answers.
No matter your goals or your budget, you can always count on transparent communication and a thorough onboarding process. We work collaboratively, meaning we’ll always listen to your thoughts, ideas, and goals before coming up with our plan of action.
You can fully outsource our services, or call on us to supplement your in-house team. Either way, our aim is to create a respectful, collaborative, and profitable relationship.

                    Marketing for Doctors | Top Growth Strategies

                                            
                                                            In the past, medical doctors could maintain a profitable patient volume in a physician-focused market. Plus, you can get away with a one-size-fits-all approach to marketing because as long as you provide healthcare, people will come to you. That’s not the case anymore, especially with the current consumer-driven market. Physicians must invest in a robust digital marketing campaign to grow their practice with the healthcare industry growing more competitive. Below are several growth strategies regarding marketing for doctors.

                    The primary goal of medical doctors and healthcare practitioners is to increase patient volume and nurture patient retention. But with the massive shift of the healthcare industry into a more consumer-driven market, physicians are tasked with developing robust digital marketing to attract new and more tech-savvy patients.Table of Contents1.

Nowadays, patients rely on online sources 1.7 times more than traditional referrals when searching for a healthcare provider. This means doctors can’t longer rely on conventional marketing methods to attract new patients and grow their practice. As such, patients are more conscious of their roles as healthcare consumers and would instead take sole control of their healthcare journey.
Thankfully, consumer-driven healthcare has leveled the digital marketing arena, which means that small practices and consolidated brands can compete with a fully-realized digital marketing strategy. Below are several time-tested marketing strategies for doctors looking to increase patient volume and grow their healthcare brand.
There are various marketing strategies to attract more customers and build brand awareness. However, digital marketing for doctors can look different than most other local businesses. Make sure your healthcare marketing team adopts the following strategies:
 
1. Understand Patient Needs
The pivotal shift to a more consumer-driven market pushed healthcare providers to focus their marketing efforts directly on patients. If you want to make this direct-to-patient approach work, you need to understand the needs of the patients–who are ultimately tasked with medical decisions. By understanding the patients’ needs, healthcare companies can reach and engage patients directly, which helps build trust and brand awareness.
Once you have a good grasp of your ideal patient’s needs, motivations, and challenges, you can craft your messaging for your marketing campaign. With that said, your messaging must be less technical and focuses on patient education. Speak their language and tell them everything they need to know about their medical needs, treatments, and symptoms. If your messaging resonates with patients, they will likely engage with your brand.
 
2. Create a Patient-Centric Website
Your website is at the heart of your digital marketing campaign–your digital front door, if you will. Your medical website serves as the first touchpoint between the patient and your practice. Basically, your website presents a golden opportunity to make a lasting impression among visitors and generally impact your profitability and reputation. Statistics support this because 57% of internet users will not recommend a business after a poor web experience.
To ensure great first impressions for your brand, create a patient-centric website by adopting the best practices in web design. So what does a patient-centric medical website look like?

Fast, intuitive, and responsive: Patient-centricity is about removing barriers and friction from the buyer’s journey, aka providing a comfortable user experience. At the very least, your medical website must be fast-loading, easy to navigate, and work correctly on all devices (desktop or mobile).
Searchable and discoverable content: Most visitors coming to your website have healthcare concerns and questions and need answers ASAP. Your medical website should have key information like articles, service pages, and insurance information that must be easy to find and searchable. Don’t hide your best content behind confusing layouts, poorly-designed menus, and multiple web pages.
Make it easy for patients to choose you: The worst thing that can happen is a captured lead that your website can’t convert because you can’t guide them to your conversion points. Make it easy for patients to convert with AI chatbots, prominent call-to-actions (CTAs), and information request forms.


 
3. Leverage Local SEO for Doctors
The majority of healthcare providers will compete at a local level. After all, healthcare is a local service. It makes sense; medical doctors rely on attracting patients within their geographical area, while patients want to work with a nearby physician. Thus, a good bulk of SEO for doctors should focus on enhancing their local web presence with local SEO.
Below are several proven strategies to improve your practice’s organic search visibility within your geographical area.
Citations & Listings
A winning local SEO campaign can start by optimizing citations and listings. For example, you can leverage mainstream structured directories like Healthgrades, WebMD, Yelp, and ZocDoc by populating them with accurate and timely information about your practice. It can be as simple as providing your NAP (name, address, phone number) and other relevant information.
Create Localized Keyword Strategies
Sitewide keywords will not do much for your local SEO efforts. Therefore, you and your marketing team should discuss which local SEO keywords to target. One good tip for developing a solid local keyword strategy is to focus on your unique selling propositions (USPs), geographical location, and how people search for your services. Keep in mind that local SEO keywords are generally high-intent, solution aware, and location-based.
 
4. Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile
One of the most straightforward and highly effective ways of bolstering your local presence is by claiming and optimizing your Google Business Profile or GBP. Thanks to various SERP features, such as local map packs, featured snippets, and GBP, Google has become a destination for many searchers instead of a map. This is because people find precisely what they need from the search results page.
GBP is a listing for physical locations like clinics or health centers, and it’s tied to Google Search and Maps. It’s Google’s primary method of verifying a business, so you must claim and optimize your practice’s GBP. If not, you can simply create your profile since it’s free. Optimizing your GBP is as simple as providing the following information:

Practice name
Address
Contact information (phone number, email)
Business hours
On-site photos of staff and facility
Appointment links
Health protocols (i.e., COVID-19 restrictions)
A short blurb describing your practice

In addition, GBP also lets you add more content like videos, a list of services and amenities, payment type accepted, insurance information, etc. GBP listings also have a place where patients can leave reviews, which works similarly to platforms like Yelp, Angie’s List, etc.
 
5. Be Active on Social Media
Did you know that around 90% of Americans seek healthcare-related information on social media? Whether it’s Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, or Instagram, your next patient is likely using social media networks to look up healthcare

topics. Social media marketing is essentially a direct line to your target patients, especially among Millennials and Gen-Z patients.
Social media platforms aren’t just for posting announcements and business activities; they’re open channels for communication with your patients. In fact, a recent survey found that 12% of healthcare marketers have gained
patient insights via social media marketing. In another survey,
60% of patients said they trust doctors who post on social media.
True enough, social media marketing makes your practice current and approachable. You can engage people on social media by regularly posting doctor interviews, medical Q&As, facility video tours, and staff member highlights. It’s a great way to personalize and humanize your digital marketing efforts.
Having active accounts on various social media networks drives patient engagement and helps attract new patients, thus growing your practice.
6. Utilize Content Marketing
The healthcare world can be cold, complex, and intimidating for many patients. You can bridge that gap between the patient and the healthcare industry with a strong content strategy. Content marketing is one of the greatest tools doctors can use for patient engagement and to build trust and credibility for their brands.
With content marketing, you can demonstrate your knowledge and expertise through educational content such as blog articles, press releases, case studies, webinars, and many more. Using high-quality and relevant content, you’re positioning yourself as an authority and a trustworthy resource for patients. Use your content to answer common patient questions and provide valuable information. You’re also enhancing your search rankings by integrating target keywords and phrases.
A robust content marketing campaign also gets you on the good side of Google–thanks to the recent Helpful Content Update that rolled out last year. Your website and other pages should offer consumers more relevant and helpful content. Therefore, you can’t rely on previous practices like optimizing keyword density, word count, and keyword stuffing anymore.
 
7. Use Video Marketing for Doctors
Admittedly, many physicians and healthcare providers do not fully embrace video marketing–but that’s a big mistake. According to recent research, 92% of video marketers claimed that this marketing approach has helped them obtain a positive ROI. But you probably think video production is expensive because you’ll need professional videographers and editors. You don’t have to create professional-grade videos to advertise your practice (but it certainly helps).
Doctors have several themes for creating marketing videos, including:

Meet the team videos: Healthcare can be intimidating for many people, and many would go for providers they’re familiar with. Making videos of your healthcare team will engage patients and help them familiarize themselves with your team. Patients will be comfortable with you and your team before entering the building.
Specialty educational videos: Create videos that will help patients understand their medical conditions and the services you provide better. For example, you can make a simple video explaining diabetes and the best treatments and management strategies available.
Patient testimonials: Testimonial videos are powerful tools in video marketing as they help build trust and credibility for your brand. Patient feedback about their healthcare experiences is a top-notch storytelling vehicle for engaging patients and earning their trust.
Frequently asked questions (FAQs): Patients will have many questions and concerns about their healthcare journey. Determine the most common questions people have about your practice through your social channels and listings, then create a video that provides detailed answers to those questions.

Direct-to-consumer style video content is unparalleled when it comes to engagement, despite its relatively low-budget nature.
 
8. Invest in PPC Marketing
Due to the urgent nature of healthcare, doctors can provide emergency healthcare solutions to patients. With that said, Pay-per-click advertising or PPC, remains one of the fastest ways for doctors to reach their target audience. PPC lets you place your practice in front of high-quality leads by showing your ads at the top of the search engine results.
Below are some time-tested strategies that will improve the performance of your PPC campaign:
Choose the Right Account Structure
Modern PPC now relies on automated systems more than ever. With Google Ads, you can leverage its automated bidding systems for more strategic and efficient. However, you need to use the appropriate account structure to get the most out of Google’s Smart Bidding System. For example, we generally utilize hybrid accounts for multi-location physician groups to take advantage of the best qualities of both segmented and consolidated structures.

Target Search Intent Along the Patient Funnel
Successful PPC marketers know the importance of aligning keywords and ad groups along the patient journey funnel. Modern healthcare consumers are more tech-savvy and will research extensively before booking their first appointment. Google calls this phenomenon the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) as consumers move slowly through the stages of the buyer’s journey.
Hence, your healthcare marketing team must develop a patient funnel alongside each step of your target audience’s healthcare journey. This alignment requires a diverse keyword strategy and keyword groups targeting each conversion funnel phase. A basic conversion funnel should look like this:

Lower funnel or product-aware leads: These users are ripe for conversion and will likely set their first appointment. Use high-intent, product-aware keywords like “bariatric doctor near mount vernon wa” to capture leads in this funnel.
Mid-funnel or solution-aware leads: These users know they need a physician but are still determining which treatments or procedures to get. Capture leads from this funnel using keywords that educate the readers, such as “How long to recover from bariatric surgery.”
Upper funnel or problem-aware leads: These are the ZMOT leads in the process of researching and discovering solutions to their healthcare issues. They know their healthcare needs (e.g., managing chronic back pain or establishing care) but are still determining if they need a doctor. Use education keywords like “establishing care visit vs standard visit” to optimize.

 
9. Manage Your Digital Reputation
A positive reputation within the community is an invaluable asset for doctors. Recent surveys say that 71% of internet users refer to online reviews when evaluating a healthcare provider. This is hardly a surprise; people want to work with the best-reviewed healthcare provider nearby. A positive online reputation encourages hospitals and medical professionals to refer patients to your clinic or facility. These facts highlight the importance of a good reputation management campaign.
The best way to get more reviews for your practice is to ask the patients directly. Train all your patient-facing staff members on the most effective review collection processes. Tell your patients to relate their experiences; many would be happy to do so, especially if they’re satisfied with their visits.
Completing the reviews must be fast and easy, or your patients won’t bother. You must ensure multiple channels for leaving reviews, including your follow-up emails, short surveys, your website and social media accounts, and GBP listing. Lastly, consider investing in review solicitation software like Podium, Birdeye, and Weave since they can integrate with various CRM systems and automate your review collection process.
 
10. Monitor Your Marketing Campaign
One of the core pillars of digital marketing is business intelligence, where you gain marketing insights to visualize growth and determine which of your marketing pieces are producing results. If you’re not monitoring your marketing campaign, how will you know if your marketing efforts are paying off?
Generally, I recommend that doctors with multiple locations use the closed-loop reporting (CLR) model to connect the dots about how each marketing piece affects the patient journey (i.e., leads that generate the most sales). CLR enables you to gain new customer insights backed by reliable data.
However, the key to proper CLR implementation is the suitable attribution model, such as first-touch, last-touch, linear, multi-touch, time-decay, etc.
 
Data-Driven Digital Marketing for Doctors
With the processes outlined, doctors should be able to kickstart their marketing campaign on the right foot. With the pivotal shift towards healthcare consumerization, doctors should focus on patient-centricity when crafting their marketing campaigns. Doctors need to build trust and credibility with patients in their communities by understanding their needs and providing valuable content and comfortable user experiences.

                            Cardinal gave me my dream internship as I got to learn from sophisticated digital marketers who truly cared about my personal development. As I came onboard full-time after my internship, Cardinal continued to support me by helping me learn new disciplines and allowing me to pivot into new roles. Although I started as an SEO intern, I eventually worked my way up to Director of PPC after years of experience learning the ins and outs of paid search, display, video and more, all the while feeling 100% supported by my company.

                    We like to think of our downtown Chamblee office as “badass” (as our CEO would say). You’ll get free parking, free coffee, free snacks, and even free foosball, AND there are several amazing restaurants and breweries nearby. Take a virtual tour of our office and see if you can see yourself learning and growing your digital marketing skills in a fun, creative, and upbeat environment.

                How Does Cardinal Maintain Exclusivity in Competitive Healthcare Markets?

                
                
            

            
            
                At Cardinal Digital Marketing, we’ve developed a framework that allows us to leverage deep industry expertise while while protecting client confidentiality. Our services are divided into six tactical teams, each working independently to prevent any significant overlap or disclosure of sensitive information. Above that sits a strategy team that guides goal alignment and performance. This approach ensures that our clients can capitalize on our profound healthcare expertise while ensuring their intellectual property is safe and sound.

                        What is the onboarding process like?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We know you don’t have time for long, exhaustive onboarding processes. We intentionally make onboarding fast, painless, and thorough. Onboarding starts with a kickoff call; we get to know each other and lay the groundwork for the next steps. From there, we move on to the client questionnaire to get a closer look at your needs and goals. We run a few audits, engage in a strategy session, and then move on to setting goals and KPIs. Digital integrations come after that, and then it’s launch time! After launch, we move on to the monitoring, continual improvement, and reporting stage. All of this happens in your first three months of working with Cardinal.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What happens to my existing ad campaigns?
                                            
                    
                        
                            A good digital marketing agency isn’t necessarily going to come in and blow everything up. Why change or get rid of something that’s delivering favorable outcomes? Yet, you wouldn’t be contracting with a new digital marketing

agency if your campaigns were meeting expectations.
Before we can make any decisions, we need to thoroughly evaluate your existing campaigns, their objectives, and how they’re performing. At this point, we’ll decide to either optimize existing campaigns or sunset them. If we decide to sunset some of the campaigns, it will be carefully timed to avoid any disruption to your lead flow.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How long does it take to get started?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We won’t keep you waiting. Right after our kickoff call, we’ll begin with small-scale changes we can make based on the answers to your client questionnaire. We assess your current digital marketing program, develop your new strategy, and build your campaigns. All of this happens within the first 30 days after kickoff. 
By day 31, the strategy has been approved and all the integrations are complete. Day 40 is usually around when the campaigns launch. After that, we continuously monitor, improve, and report on your campaigns until the end of your contract.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What’s your typical contract length?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Our minimum contract length is 6 months — that’s usually the amount of time it’ll take to see the results kick in. Complex media strategies take a little time to lift off the ground! We set performance-based goals for all our clients every 3 months, so we stay in constant communication with clients and continually monitor performance to ensure they’re getting the results they expect.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you predict future performance and ROI?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We’re not Nostradamus, but we can make educated predictions. Every engagement starts with a comprehensive audit of your existing digital presence and campaign performance, competitor assessments, and market research. Data from our other healthcare clients’ campaigns inform our strategies and allows us to determine performance forecasts.
You’ll also know what to expect at each step thanks to our detailed roadmaps, which outline next steps and performance improvements that lie ahead.

                A Centralized Marketing Strategy to Guide Growth

                
                
            

            
            
                Before turning to Cardinal, Peak Dental’s marketing efforts were fragmented, involving different agencies for various locations. To improve efficiency and guide marketing strategy for their entire platform, the organization determined that they should partner with a single agency that could handle all their digital marketing.
During ongoing expansion, Cardinal stepped in as a growth partner to Peak Dental, centralizing their marketing operations and guiding strategy to drive new patient acquisition. As a result of our holistic, hands-on approach, Peak Dental has seen a dramatic increase in lead volume, conversion rate, and click-through rate, as well as a significant boost in organic performance across their various domains.

                Peak Dental Services

                
                
            

            
            
                A private equity-backed DSO (Dental Support Organization), Peak Dental Services includes 61 locations across Texas & Colorado, each with its own unique identity and brand. As a DSO, Peak Dental helps these practices run smoothly and efficiently, delivering the support dentist leaders need so they can focus on providing the highest standard of patient care.
The organization currently maintains an aggressive growth strategy that focuses on de novo clinic openings and acquisitions across Colorado and into adjacent geographic markets.
            

            
            
        

        
        
            

                
            
        

        
    







    
    


    
    
        
            

                
                
                
            
        
    

    
    
    

        
        
            
                Challenges:
Peak Dental faced a number of challenges in their digital marketing efforts, including:


An inefficient marketing agency structure that spanned multiple, disparate agencies and vendors
No structured, scalable approach to paid media, SEO, and analytics that could facilitate the rapid onboarding of new practices


            
        

        
        
        
            
                Goals:
Cardinal established two main goals in partnering with Peak Dental:


To drive new patient acquisition for all locations
To help the organization gain visibility in a highly competitive industry


            
        

        
    

    
    







    
    

    
        
            

                
                Step 1

                
                
                Improve Google Ads Relevancy & Efficiency 

                
                
            

            
            
                To meet their revenue targets, Peak Dental needed to bring in more patients at a lower cost per acquisition (CPA). To do this, Cardinal ensured that all Peak Dental Google Ads contained the most relevant messaging and were placed in front of an ideal audience—those ready to find a local dentist.
To maximize campaign efficiency and leverage Google’s machine learning capabilities, we used a consolidated Google Ads account structure and paired it with a hands-on management approach, fine-tuning all locations.
As a result, we have been able to increase lead volume most cost-effectively, setting Peak Dental up for continued expansion and growth in keeping with their goals.

                            Consolidation was a must to achieve maximum efficiency. We combined all 60+ of their campaigns into one new Google Ads account, then split up campaigns into Branded and Non-Branded. 
Since Peak Dental locations maintain different hours and emergency centers run 24/7, we also established a separate Emergency campaign for those locations.

                            Our keyword and bidding strategy has evolved with ongoing testing. We found that phrase matches such as “dentists near me” were helping some Peak Dental locations, but not all. 
We’ve also tested and deployed broad match where appropriate. Always looking for ways to refine and improve, we have consistently optimized the keyword strategy according to each location’s nuances.

                        

                        
                    

                    

                    
                    

                        
                        
                                                        
                                                                    Messaging & Ad Copy                                                                

                                                        


                            
                                                        
                        

                        


                        

                        
                        

                            Next, we turned our attention to Peak Dental’s ad copy, cleaning up existing messaging for all locations, revising keywords, and leveraging promotions to drive new patient acquisition. 
Since all locations have their own tagline, we tailored the ad copy to each site to retain individual brand identity. Our messaging strategy reflects each market and addresses patients’ information needs. 

                        

                        
                    

                    

                    
                
            
        

        
    







    
    


    
    
        
            

                
                Step 2

                
                
                Clean Up Domains and Fix Technical SEO Issues

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
    

        
        
            
                Google is the number one place people go to when searching for a nearby dentist. To beat local competition, we ensured Peak’s practices appeared at the top of the search engine results page.
To start, our team tackled three of Peak Dental’s domains: Cody Dental Group, Blooming Dental, and Empire Dental. To improve their SEO foundation, we first made sure the sites were technically sound. This was critical, as ensuring a site is being indexed and crawled property is key for rankings and traffic.
            
        

        
        
        
            
                We conducted the followings steps:

Optimized title tags and meta descriptions
Added internal links and target keywords throughout content
Audited blogs to limit onsite duplication
Expanded the content on the websites for key services

Next, we completed coverage, canonical, and schema audits to ensure the correct pages were being indexed and crawled. Finally, we executed site speed optimizations on all three sites
            
        

        
    

    
    







    
    

    
        
            

                
                Step 3

                
                
                Leverage Advanced Analytics to Generate Quality Leads

                
                
            

            
            
                Next, we focused on building custom reporting dashboards that included their most important KPIs, allowing them to track campaign performance across channels and locations. The dashboard reports:

How many qualified leads each channel is driving by location
The number of calls & form fills by channel
Each location’s individual performance
Performance based on specific ad groups

We integrated Peak’s call-tracking solution (CallRail) into their reporting dashboard and set up CallRail for several locations that didn’t have it. This additional data has allowed us to identify optimization opportunities that have increased lead quality and, subsequently, increased conversion rates.
Previously, Peak Dental took an “anything and everything” approach to leads, considering all phone calls as leads no matter the nature of the call. Now, they have stronger understanding of their actual patient pipeline.

                                                            The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving. Healthcare used to be a volume-based market centered around physicians but has now transformed into a quality-based sector revolving around consumers. Healthcare organizations looking for sustainable growth and increasing patient volume should ensure they have a fully-realized healthcare marketing strategy in place.

                    The healthcare industry is quickly rebounding as we move on from the pandemic. Consumer demand is returning to pre-pandemic levels, and more patients are catching up on outpatient visits and elective hospitalizations. However, there’s no doubt that the pandemic has done a number to the healthcare industry, especially after a sharp decline in healthcare utilization. If anything, healthcare providers have collectively realized that in order to stay ahead of the curve, they need to accelerate the adoption of digital solutions based on the changing industry landscape.Table of ContentsWhat Exactly is Healthcare Marketing?The Importance of Healthcare MarketingWhat Makes for Effective Healthcare Marketing?What are the Benefits of Healthcare Marketing?Healthcare Marketing Puts Patients First
This is where healthcare marketing comes into play. Physicians and other healthcare providers must step up their digital marketing game to increase patient volume and remain competitive. Join me as we discuss the importance of healthcare marketing and its impacts and benefits for your practice.
 
What Exactly is Healthcare Marketing?
Like other businesses, healthcare providers need multiple means to spread the word about their facilities, services, and treatments. The healthcare system is complex, with many different components, treatments, and procedures, which can overwhelm the average consumer. Healthcare marketing aims to bridge this gap by utilizing creative strategies to engage and educate patients.
This is especially critical since consumer behavior has changed in the digital age. People no longer rely on referrals, word of mouth, and traditional marketing when searching for a physician. Modern consumers have taken ownership of their healthcare journey and will research and evaluate practitioners through the Internet. In fact, 69% of millennial patients would turn to the web for medical advice instead of their primary care physician.

Healthcare marketing aims to increase brand awareness, build trust and credibility with patients, and guide them through their healthcare journey. With that said, healthcare marketing is a multi-tiered approach involving various strategies such as search engine optimization (SEO), paid search, web design, social media, reputation management, and more.
 
The Importance of Healthcare Marketing
As more private equity companies seek to consolidate practices within the healthcare system, smaller practices need all the help they can get to compete. This is where healthcare marketing comes into play. In today’s consumer-driven care landscape, healthcare organizations must employ a targeted, data-driven healthcare marketing campaign if they’re hoping to be more competitive.
With the right strategies and tools, medical providers can have the upper hand by attracting new patients and retaining old ones. For instance, you can engage and educate patients with relevant, personalized, and timely healthcare content. Not only will your practice be poised to attract new patients with a proper marketing playbook, but you’re also fostering brand loyalty and encouraging repeat business.

Ultimately, the goal of healthcare digital marketing is to drive high-quality leads, increase revenue, and maintain healthy profit margins. However, suppose you want to achieve these feats with good results. In that case, you need a robust marketing strategy using multiple channels to reach more potential patients and utilize comprehensive analytics to measure your campaign and adjust accordingly.
 
What Makes for Effective Healthcare Marketing?
Whether you’re a single or multi-location healthcare organization, you should know that brand positioning can influence patient decisions regarding health systems, providers, and services to pursue. Effective healthcare marketing takes a patient-first approach that will empower prospective patients as well as form stronger patient-physician relationships.
So what does an effective marketing strategy look like? Below are the characteristics of a successful healthcare marketing campaign:
Patient-Centric and Personalized
If you’re still using cookie-cutter strategies targeting the “average” consumer, your campaign will fall flat on its face. For example, blasting outreach messages via your email list will miss the mark for some patients (e.g., those who prefer text messages). In the same vein, if your options for reaching out are within fixed hours and channels, you’re not providing a personalized experience. With the industry leaning more into a more consumer-driven landscape, the ball is in the marketers’ court.
Based on a Dassault Systèmes and CITE Research survey, 83% of consumers prefer a tailored experience relevant to their unique needs and circumstances. On a related note, younger consumers are taking their healthcare journeys into their own hands and are leading the push for personalized experiences. Moreover, the survey states consumers are more interested in personalized health-related items such as customized preventative health plans.
All signs point to only one thing: personalized and patient-centered marketing.
Whether your goal is to attract new patients or retain your current ones, personalization must be a core pillar of your campaign. Tailored messaging appeals to an individual’s unique interests and needs, allowing your brand to form stronger relationships based on trust and credibility. By leveraging analytics, consumer data, and various tools, you can create custom messages that will resonate with patients most likely to convert.
As a result, your brand becomes a trusted resource and partner as they navigate the healthcare system. Therefore, all your healthcare marketing content should be personalized, accurate, and actionable.
Data-Driven Marketing
In digital marketing, if you’re not measuring, you’re guessing. To stay ahead of the curve in today’s ever-changing market, businesses must employ data-driven marketing–meaning they have to generate, analyze, and apply data to their strategies. According to a 2023 survey by HubSpot, 36% of marketers said data is crucial for understanding consumer behavior and reaching their target audience. Without data and proper analytics, how will you know which of your marketing pieces are producing results and which areas need improvement?
Therefore, healthcare organizations should have business intelligence solutions in place, including flexible reporting options, multi-location dashboards, value-based tracking, monthly reporting, and more. By using data and applying it to their strategies, healthcare marketers can expect the following benefits:

Reach target consumers more effectively
Understand which marketing tactics are most effective
Create a more patient-centric content strategy
Increase ROI of marketing campaigns
Receive proof of value of marketing efforts

Effective healthcare marketing goes beyond demographic information. With data-driven marketing, you’ll have a more intimate knowledge of your ideal patients, how they like to shop for healthcare items, where they consume information and media, the challenges or pain points they face, etc.
Empowered by Digital Marketing Technologies
Historically, the healthcare sector has been slow to adopt digital technologies, and many physicians have relied on traditional marketing methods like referrals, TVs, and word of mouth to grow patient volume. If the pandemic has taught us anything, every industry has accelerated the adoption of digital solutions–especially healthcare.
Despite concerns about cyberattacks and the privacy of sensitive medical data, experts remain optimistic about the potential of digital solutions not just for marketing initiatives but also for improving patient access.
With that said, digital marketing solutions will lead to higher ROI than traditional marketing methods. Plus, digital marketing is measurable, which means you can track the performance of your campaigns, optimize them, and develop more integrated strategies. Otherwise, if you don’t accelerate the adoption of digital solutions for your practice, you’ll lose potential patients and play catch up to your competitors.
Digital Marketing Strategies for Healthcare Websites
Below are proven digital marketing strategies for growing your healthcare practice:

Build a scalable website platform: A website will be the core of your marketing efforts, but you must ensure a scalable website for future growth and patient acquisition goals. Consider how your healthcare website will fit as you put out more locations and expand to new regions. Also, ensure you have a coherent website design and function across all locations and brands.

The Cardinal team helped Traditions Health create a patient-centric website that is completely scalable for adding new locations pages, blog content, or additional services.

Develop strong SEO foundations: Consumers now turn to search engines for healthcare information. As such, your website not only needs to look good, but it should have solid foundations for SEO. Multi-location healthcare groups must ensure that their website has a solid technical SEO foundation and adheres to current best practices, especially on a local level.
Optimize Google Ads campaigns: PPC remains one of the best paid means for healthcare groups to boost their patient pipelines. With a well-optimized paid search campaign, you can attract high-quality leads to your doorsteps and turn your website into a patient-generating machine. The keys to optimizing your PPC campaign are the proper account structure, a funnel-based strategy, and an optimized bidding strategy.
Measure performance with reporting and analytics: A centralized marketing strategy is necessary for any multi-location healthcare organization. The ability to monitor performance metrics such as cost per acquisition (CPA), retention rate, and search engine rankings will allow you to streamline operations and save on costs by getting rid of underperforming systems. I wrote an extensive guide about this topic on How to Measure Healthcare Marketing Performance.
Optimize conversion rates: Conversion rate optimization or CRO is the process of improving the effectiveness of your website in converting visitors into loyal patients. CRO is about understanding what motivates your ideal patient to create custom ads, landing pages, and content that appeal to these motivations. Some steps to improve conversion rates in a healthcare website include providing complete information, leveraging social proof, streamlining the appointment process, and mobile optimization.

 
What are the Benefits of Healthcare Marketing?
If you want to take your campaign to new heights, you should learn about the benefits of digital marketing for healthcare.
1. Increase Patient Retention
Between the evolving healthcare landscape and changing consumer behaviors, patient loyalty is more critical than ever. In general, attracting and converting new patients costs more than retaining your current ones. Patient retention is a worthy pursuit because of repeat business and the referrals they may give to others.
A fully-realized marketing campaign with proper communication channels can help retain current patients. For instance, patient feedback is an incredible source of truth from channels like surveys, in-visit interviews, review platforms, social media, etc. As such, every data collected will steer your marketing campaign in the right direction.
Marketing automation (MA) is another great tool to empower your customer retention program. MA provides the ability to automate touchpoints and operational efficiencies so your brand is always top-of-mind for your patients.
2. Cover Each Step of the Patient’s Journey
Healthcare marketers who are worth their salt know the importance of the patient journey. Before healthcare marketing, only a few people know about the patient journey. Now, with the oversight provided by digital marketing, marketers can track every step of the patient journey–from searching for information about symptoms to setting up an appointment.
Digital healthcare marketing involves mapping out the patient journey and identifying key touchpoints. Each stage presents a unique opportunity to engage patients and provide information relevant to their needs. This enables your brand to build a long-lasting relationship with patients, which equals patient satisfaction and retention.

3. Generate a Consistent Lead Pipeline
One of your ultimate goals in healthcare marketing is to create your “marketing funnel” where you can generate high-quality leads and sales from website traffic. The idea is to differentiate the “window shoppers” from visitors searching for the services and treatments you offer.
Succeed in developing your marketing funnel, and your campaign will be in the best position to consistently generate leads. As a result, your practice doesn’t have to rely solely on traditional marketing methods to create walk-in leads.
4. Target the Ideal Audience
As mentioned earlier, generating high-quality leads is the primary purpose of healthcare marketing. Having said that, many digital marketing systems allow you to target specific audience groups via tools that help you track consumer behavior and demographic information. With enough data, marketers can present marketing offers highly relevant to the ideal patient.
This ties back to personalization in marketing. If a visitor receives content based on their needs and online behavior, it creates positive reinforcement and more satisfying customer experiences. Healthcare marketing also lets you target patients depending on where they are in their healthcare journey.
5. Stay on Top of Your Campaign
Under digital marketing, you can measure just about every relevant healthcare metric you want, including:

Patient acquisition cost
Marketing originated patient percentage
Patient lifetime value
Patient retention rate
Patient satisfaction scores
Paid advertising metrics
SEO metrics
Lead source attribution
And many more…

As you collect more data, you can optimize each of your marketing strategies appropriately. However, just because you can measure everything doesn’t mean you should. Remember not to lose sight of your goals and determine the most critical data that support your marketing objectives.
Ultimately, monitoring your campaign will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of your marketing pursuits. Simply put, you’ll know which of your strategies are working, which have room for improvement, and which should be scrapped.
6. Build Trust and Credibility for Your Brand
Building trust and credibility with your patients is one of the most important things you can do for your practice. Apart from boosting revenue, trust can be an excellent growth barometer. Healthcare marketing puts you in a stronger position to develop stronger patient-physician relationships.
For example, you can leverage content strategies to connect with patients and address their concerns and questions. You can establish yourself as a reliable healthcare resource by providing real-world value through your content. Thus, aim to create high-impact content that serves the patient’s needs to build trust and credibility for your brand.
Meanwhile, make sure that you have a sound online reputation because it dramatically affects your credibility as a healthcare provider. This is important because almost all potential patients read online reviews of providers before booking an appointment. In this regard, ensure you have a proactive reputation management strategy and a scalable review collection system.
 
Healthcare Marketing Puts Patients First
Private practices and multi-location groups can’t afford to overlook the importance of a robust healthcare marketing strategy. As you can see, healthcare marketing provides a multitude of benefits, like improved patient retention, consistent lead generation, and building brand trust and credibility. As healthcare shifts into a consumer-driven industry, digital healthcare marketing ultimately helps improve patient outcomes.

                    In today’s hyper-competitive healthcare industry, a robust online presence is pretty much a necessity for physicians and medical practices. With the massive shift in consumer behavior, almost everyone is turning to search engines when looking for a local healthcare provider. Since healthcare needs are often urgent, consumers will usually choose paths with the least resistance. Thus, if your practice is at the top of the search engine results page (SERP), you can connect and help more patients with their healthcare concerns.
Thankfully, search engine optimization or SEO for doctors is more accessible than ever. With the proper fine-tuning and optimization of an SEO campaign, even small or brand-new practices can compete with more prominent, consolidated brands–especially with the tremendous shift towards local SEO.
Below, I have outlined the most effective SEO strategies doctors and medical practices can use to take your SEO efforts to new heights, increase patient volume, and support scalable growth.
 
Why SEO for Doctors?
SEO is a multi-faceted, relatively long, and ongoing process that involves various strategies that will help optimize your healthcare website and improve search engine rankings. There are still disturbingly many doctors and healthcare practitioners who believe that a website, social media account, and word of mouth are enough to grow their patient base. Many of them are in for a rude awakening.
Don’t believe us? Let’s take a look at some statistics.
For starters, 66% of online experiences start with search engines. And today, consumers come to search engines like Google for health-related questions and concerns. Google, in particular, processes hundreds of millions of healthcare queries on a daily basis. Breaking it further down, 66% of users have looked for a specific illness or issue, while 55% of people went online for a certain medical procedure or treatment. Another critical set of facts that marketers should know is that 77% of potential patients have used a search engine before booking their first appointment. Furthermore, search drives three times more traffic to hospitals and healthcare websites than non-search traffic
Another noteworthy consumer trend doctors should know is that 90% of patients use online reviews when evaluating a physician or healthcare provider. And 80% of healthcare consumers trust online reviews as much as referrals and personal recommendations. While these trends highlight the importance of online reputation for healthcare professionals, they also reinforce several tried-and-true marketing strategies, including SEO.
A properly search-optimized website will have a higher rank in the SERPs. This is critical because the top 5 organic search results on the first page account for 67.6% of all clicks. In other words, if your healthcare website is on the front page, you’ll more likely attract patients explicitly looking for your services and treatments.
Ultimately, a robust full-funnel SEO strategy will help drive organic traffic and highly qualified leads to your healthcare brand. Plus, modern SEO best practices encourage marketers to adopt a patient-first approach which will help strengthen and cement your brand as a trusted provider in the community.

As mentioned, SEO is a multi-tiered process consisting of various strategies that work in unison to improve your website’s search rankings. Below are several proven best SEO practices every physician should apply to their practice.
1. Create a User-Centric Medical Website
Your SEO efforts will start with your healthcare website. You may be able to drive traffic to your website via SEO, but your hopes of converting visitors will quickly dissipate with poor web design. It makes sense; your website is your digital front door and will be the first touchpoint for most of your patients. With that said, your website acts as a vital touchpoint because it’s a golden opportunity for your practice to make an excellent first impression.
With great website design complete with professional layouts, images, and design elements, you’re presenting your practice as a reputable, trustworthy provider. Conversely, 40% of users will quickly abandon a poorly-designed website. Outlined below are quick tips for a more user-centric medical website:
Optimize for UX, Speed, and Mobile
A must-have element of your web design strategy is frictionless user experience. To put it simply, your healthcare website must be well-designed, easy to navigate, loads fast, and works like a charm on all devices. For starters, ensure you incorporate intuitive web design elements such as readable and clean fonts, sensible menus and layouts, and professional images.
Page speed is also crucial since a mere 1 to 3 seconds slower in page load speeds will increase bounce rates by as much as 32%. I highly recommend using Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool to check the load speeds of your pages. Some ways to increase page load speeds include:

Use a performance-optimized hosting solution
Compress and optimize your site images
Eliminate or minimize redirects
Enable web page caching
Enable browser caching
Remove unnecessary plugins
Utilize a content delivery network (CDN)

Last but not least, ensure your healthcare website is optimized for mobile users. Websites that are not optimized for mobile users are considered bad UX websites. In fact, almost 75% of users will not return to a website not optimized for mobile, so you can’t afford to overlook mobile-friendliness. Your website should employ responsive design so it displays correctly, regardless of whether it’s viewed from a desktop computer or mobile. 
Conduct On-Site Optimization for Websites
Certain things should happen before your website ranks in search engines:

Your website must be discoverable by search engines
The search crawlers must understand your topics and identify keywords
The search engine indexes your website so it can be displayed for relevant queries

Therefore, your website must have a strong SEO foundation by addressing the technical side of things, aka on-site optimization. It ensures that your healthcare website and pages will help Google scan and index your content without issues. The most important factors in on-site optimization include the following:

Simple URL structure – Make your URLs simple and short, and include as little beyond your primary keywords.
Navigation and links – Search engine crawlers follow your links to navigate and find other content on your website.
Sitemap and robots.txt  – These are crucial files that enable Google to do its job: crawl pages and content to index. Having both files will significantly accelerate the crawling and indexing of your website.
Dead links and redirects – People clicking links and ending up on non-existent pages results in a horrible user experience. Plus, they prevent Google from indexing your content.
Duplicate content – If similar content pieces appear in more than one place on your website, you’ll get a penalty from Google.

2. Claim Google Business Profile
In many ways, search engines have become user destinations rather than a map for accessing information. The increasing percentages of “zero-click” searches indicate that users can find what they’re looking for from the Google search results–thanks to various SERP features. Arguably one of the most essential SERP features is the Google Business Profile or GBP.
Google has been expanding the features of GBP, giving healthcare marketers more opportunities to provide valuable information to potential patients. One of the simplest ways healthcare brands can improve their organic search presence (especially locally) is to claim their GBP. This SERP feature represents a listing for your physical location tied in with Google Search and Maps, and it’s the first thing potential patients see when they search for a local healthcare provider.
To optimize your GBP, make sure that you provide accurate and timely information, including:

Practice name
Address
Phone number
Business hours
URL
Email address
Links to booking appointments
User reviews
Photo of facility and staff

In addition, you can provide more value to your GBP by adding helpful content like frequently asked questions (FAQs) about common patient inquiries such as pricing and insurance information. Overall, ensure you update your GBP listing to be relevant to your target audience and Google. Check out our GBP optimization guide for more detailed optimization strategies.

3. Develop Geo-Optimized Websites and Landing Pages
For the majority of healthcare practices, the main arena is local. Out of roughly 89 billion searches a month, 1.5 billion are “Near Me” searches. One of the best ways to leverage the rise of Near Me or local searches, in general, is by creating geo-optimized websites and landing pages–and they’re a must if you’re a multi-location organization.
Geo-optimized or geo-targeted websites and landing pages are custom pages dedicated to a single physical location, with the URLs, metadata, and content optimized by location. However, simply including the location and a few generic paragraphs in a static landing page just won’t cut it because you’re not providing real-world value to visitors.
To optimize these location pages, you must treat them as unique landing pages that answer what users want: information about a specific healthcare location. This means you should publish about 500 words of content per page while incorporating relevant local keywords. Ensure you also include custom content to personalize the page further, including: 

Physician bios
Photos of the location and staff
FAQs (preferably in video format)
Patient reviews
Press and news section
Hospital video tours
Call to action (CTAs)

Personalization is the key ingredient to successful location websites and pages. The more you connect with the consumer by offering personalized experiences, the more likely they’ll convert.
4. Produce Patient-Centric Content
In the neverending pursuit of excellent user experiences, Google launched the Helpful Content Update, which may have changed the SEO landscape forever. With this update, marketers can say goodbye to content produced to appeal to search algorithms. Questionable practices like thin content, keyword stuffing, AMP content mismatch, cloaked images and links, and duplicate content are getting the boot.
With the new Google content update, healthcare marketers must produce robust, in-depth content that provides real-world value to users. It reinforces a stricter requirement for content quality and authenticity. Thus, you can’t just publish articles and blog posts with optimized word count and keyword density and expect your SEO efforts to flourish. In other words, your content strategy should focus on patient-centricity.
Don’t get me wrong. Keyword research and competitor analysis still play a significant role in long-term search rankings, but you can’t get away with practices like keyword stuffing anymore. With patient-centric content, you aim to provide helpful information where patients can feel like their questions have been answered or learned enough about the topic. In addition, ensure you stick to healthcare topics you specialize in and create in-depth content instead of putting out thin content about general medical topics.
5. Leverage Video Marketing
For the average consumer, the world of healthcare may seem like a cold and intimidating subject filled with unknowns–highlighting the importance of building trust and credibility for your brand. When it comes to engaging content types, videos are hard to beat. A recent study shows that as many as 91% of consumers want to see more video content from brands.

The video format is a top-notch marketing tactic for personalizing your content. With well-made videos, your healthcare brand suddenly has a face and helps patients feel connected and catered to regarding the care they’ll receive. Below are some video marketing ideas for supercharging your SEO efforts:

Video tours of a facility or hospital – If you invested a lot in the looks of your facility or clinic, there’s no better way to showcase it than video tours. By seeing your facility, patients will know what to expect and eliminate a lot of unknowns.
Meet the physician and staff videos – Create videos introducing physicians and staff members. These videos will make patients feel more welcome and enable you to nurture trust and credibility with patients before they even set foot in your building.
Patient reviews and testimonials – Reviews and testimonials are powerful social proof that enhances your brand’s trustworthiness. Let patients tell their experiences and what they went through before and after treatment.
Educational videos – These informative videos can educate patients about your treatments and services. However, ensure you adopt a more personable and relatable approach when making educational videos, like conversing with a patient.

Video marketing doesn’t just help improve your SEO by getting more eyes on your website and location pages. Still, it will also carry the ball further down the field by building patient trust and helping them convert.
6. Build High-Quality Backlinks
Although backlinks’ importance in SEO has waned over the years, they still remain a strong ranking signal for search engines like Google, especially when you earn them through organic, high-quality content. Link building has come a long way since the days of spamming links in directories and social media channels. However, in recent years, Google has changed how it evaluates backlinks. Now, it’s less about the number of backlinks the number of backlinks a website has and more about the quality of the links.
Google uses several factors when evaluating backlinks, such as:

The relevance of the linked website
The relevance of the anchor text to the link
The overall authority of the linked domain

In other words, the number of backlinks you have doesn’t matter. What matters is that your links must be of the highest quality and from authoritative sources. This aligns with the historical value of backlinks as votes of confidence for your healthcare website.
Best Practices for Building Backlinks in SEO
First and foremost, your marketing team should focus on producing high-quality and relevant healthcare content. You’re hoping for the best case scenario where your content is so great that high-authority websites will want to link your content–these organically earned links are the best type of backlinks.
In addition, you should consider collaborating with local and national organizations. You can earn links from professional organizations by being active in the medical community and organizations relevant to your practice. Consider publishing research and case studies that showcase your expertise in the topic. Press releases are also worth considering, especially if they get picked up by the local media and publishing organizations.

Hello high ROI!

                            In today’s competitive marketplace, your dermatology practice’s website needs search engine optimization (SEO). If your site is not highly ranked, prospective patients will not find you. Most searches never make it past the first page. Cardinal will target specific keywords and markets to get your search rankings where they need to be.

                            Paid social platforms such as Facebook have millions of users in the U.S.; tapping into this market can help you reach the people who are interested in the treatments you offer. We use segmentation to identify prospective clients based on location, age, gender, and estimated income to offer you high conversion rates and qualified leads.

                            So you’ve got a lot of people visiting your dermatology practice’s website, but you’re not getting that many phone calls, consultations, or appointments. Don’t fret! A strong conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategy can help increase the quality of your leads and make the most out of the traffic that you’re already receiving.

                            If you’re not tracking your dermatology practice’s website data, you will never be able to tell which campaigns are driving results, which offers are working, and which pages need better optimization. At Cardinal, we’re passionate about monitoring performance and communicating results; you’ll receive access to all of your data, dashboards, and reports. We don’t just make numbers look pretty; we believe in complete transparency and chart marketing performance against your business goals.

                            The first place patients go to find a new dermatologist is online. Whether they find your practice through SEO, PPC, or word-of-mouth, make sure your website loads quickly and is easy to navigate. First impressions go far. Your website not only needs to be sleek and well optimized, but it needs to be responsive across all devices. We make sure that once a web visitor finds your website, they can quickly find the information they are looking for, whether that be on their desktop or mobile device. BAM – hello higher conversion rates and new patients!

                When they approached Cardinal Digital Marketing, the VitalSkin team was building out internal systems and processes quickly to keep up with a growing practice acquisition pipeline. As a new company, VitalSkin had no digital presence or visibility on search engines.
Thanks to a new website that supports both SEO and conversions, VitalSkin has enjoyed top rankings for target keywords alongside steady lead generation inside six months. Our efforts at optimizing the site for online appointment bookings have helped boost conversation rate and patient flow, as well.

People search online every day for medical information and treatments for their skin. Some may be researching diseases or specific conditions of the skin. Others may be considering cosmetic dermatology treatments to improve the appearance of their skin. Cardinal can develop marketing solutions to help these prospective patients connect to your dermatology practice. Just as there are customized treatment plans for each patient, digital marketing strategies for dermatology should be tailored to meet the needs of your practice.
            
        

        
        
        
            
                Custom Digital Marketing Strategies for Dermatology Providers






Dermatologists treat diseases of the skin including skin cancer, acne, eczema, or psoriasis. They also offer cosmetic procedures such as chemical peels, or other types of fillers that can minimize skin imperfections and give patients a more youthful appearance. Cardinal’s strategic digital marketing techniques will enable prospective patients to connect with your dermatology practice online, so they can receive the treatment they need.

                        Do I need a brand-new website to market my dermatology practice?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No. We can start working our magic to grow your dermatology practice if you have a functional WordPress website with a good design and structure. On the flip side, if your website isn’t on WordPress, Cardinal can help you migrate and ensure a smooth migration from any platform. In our experience, WordPress is the ideal content management system (CMS) for ease of use, tons of customization, and SEO-friendliness.
What if you’re unhappy with the current state of your website and believe it could use a few adjustments or an overhaul? Well, Cardinal houses some of the best web designers and developers around, and they will build you a dermatology website that loads quickly, boasts a responsive design (for mobile and desktop users), and has strong SEO foundations–a well-equipped website for attracting and converting high-quality leads.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Does it take too long before I can see your marketing results?
                                            
                    
                        
                            It depends on your definition of “too long.” One of the most important things to remember about digital marketing is that it’s not an overnight solution, but a multi-pronged approach that consists of long-term strategies. This is why we always encourage our clients to understand and have realistic expectations about their campaigns.
With that said, we always set measurable and performance-oriented goals for all our clients every three months. As huge transparency advocates, Cardinal’s clients always have access to strategy roadmaps, dashboards and reports, and KPIs within their accounts. Therefore, you’ll always know what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and the expected impact.
The actual time frames will depend on the marketing solutions you need. For example, PPC Management can provide results as soon as 30 days after launching or optimizing campaigns, but a more realistic estimate would be 90 days for meaningful results. Meanwhile, a full-scale SEO campaign may yield significant results in 4-6 months up to a year. Plus, how long you’ll see the results will depend on several factors, like the current state of your marketing, competition, and budget.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you handle all areas of marketing for my dermatology practice?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We can if you want us to.
As a full-service digital marketing agency, Cardinal doesn’t just provide a wide range of services to market your dermatology business; we also deliver an integrated and cohesive strategy that incorporates all these services. From SEO to PPC Management to Web Design, every service you require will support one another to achieve your marketing goals and growth targets. Therefore, you don’t have to deal with multiple agencies to achieve the same results. However, remember that we don’t offer traditional marketing services like radio or print (we’re a digital agency, after all).
In addition, we’re not just your typical digital agency because we know the ins and outs of the healthcare industry, including the dermatology space. Cardinal has helped some of the nation’s largest dermatology practices by crafting customized digital marketing plans.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you customize my campaign to attract specific dermatology cases like eczema and psoriasis treatments?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, we can. During the onboarding process, we ensure that our marketing strategies support your priority service lines and locations, and your top marketing goals. 
Suppose you want higher-ticket patients for specific cases (e.g., Eczema and psoriasis treatments). In that case, we can focus on marketing them first, then work toward your general services like acne therapy and skin infections.
Through digital marketing strategies like SEO and PPC advertising, we can market your practice and put it in front of patients looking for a specific dermatological procedure, like eczema and psoriasis treatments. We amplify the results of these strategies by devising a customized dermatology marketing plan that will lead to higher quality leads and conversion rates.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        My dermatology website is getting good traffic, but patient numbers remain stagnant. How can you help?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Your marketing campaigns might not drive qualified leads to your website. There could be a mismatch between ad messaging and the landing page, or your keyword strategy is targeting the wrong words. 
It’s also possible that you’re still linking your PPC ads to your home page–which can be a marketing blunder. One of the best ways to change this is to create highly-optimized landing pages that will be linked to relevant PPC ads.
Landing pages are standalone pages that will enable potential patients to gain important insights into your dermatology practice and pique their interests enough to become paying customers. This approach allows you to create highly targeted messaging that aligns with the audience’s needs. It’s also easier to create streamlined user experiences that remove potential barriers and increase conversions.

What is Healthcare Marketing
As we said, healthcare marketing is multifaceted. The goal is to increase awareness of medical conditions and treatments, build trust with patients, and guide them through their unique journey. These feats are achieved through digital strategies to increase patient engagement, build reputation, and garner great patient experiences to help strengthen brand trust and credibility. With the healthcare industry growing more competitive by the day, healthcare marketing has become an essential tool for providers to reach potential patients. 
 
Advantages of Healthcare Marketing
Healthcare marketing provides many benefits for healthcare providers. An efficient marketing playbook can give providers the upper hand by attracting and retaining patients. By keeping patients engaged with relevant, personalized, and timely outreach, providers can improve loyalty and increase the likelihood of repeat business. Healthcare marketing can help providers bring in quality leads, rake in revenue, and maintain healthy profit margins. By connecting with patients across multiple channels and using comprehensive data analytics, providers can continuously measure and adjust their strategies to optimize performance and achieve business goals!
The ultimate goal is to drive more qualified leads, generate revenue, and maintain healthy profit margins to boot! To achieve this, healthcare marketers use multiple channels to reach patients and use comprehensive data analytics to evaluate their performance and tailor their strategies accordingly.
 
Building a Scalable Website Platform
When creating a healthcare marketing strategy, you first need to develop a website that can easily integrate new acquisitions and support patient acquisition goals.
When building a website for your multi-location business, you need to consider both immediate and future growth goals. Think about where your website will fit as you expand to new regions and open new locations. Consider the functionality and flexibility you’ll need in the next six months, one year and two years.
Consider how your website will look and function across all your locations and brands. Keep in mind that even if you encounter technical problems such as the need for custom coding, it doesn’t mean that you can’t grow. These are problems that can be fixed, but evaluate how much time and money it will take to fix them.
Successfully MSOs have a framework in place that supports their SEO strategy. SEO-friendly websites help search engines discover, crawl, index, and rank your website. While it can seem overwhelming, it’s not impossible. By following best practices, you can build a website that can scale with your business and ensure potential customers easily find it.

Evaluate your current position and plan for the future
Lay a strong foundation for SEO
Use scalable website technologies
Plan for migration

Cardinal created one landing page template for each core service area at Water’s Edge Dermatology. This gave them a flexible and scalable way to add new pages as they acquire new locations. We ended up creating around 200 landing pages that were not only visually pleasing but also easily customizable.
 
Strong SEO Foundation & Ongoing Optimization
When creating a website, take into account how to optimize it for search engines like Google. A visually appealing website is great, but if it doesn’t rank well on search engines, it will be difficult for potential patients to find. To ensure that your website is easily discoverable, it’s crucial to establish a strong foundation for SEO. Search engines like Google are now the go-to place for people looking for information, including healthcare-related topics. To help gain visibility quickly, we recommend a two-part approach to optimization
Technical SEO
Having a solid technical SEO foundation is crucial for multi-location healthcare groups, as it ensures that their website adheres to SEO best practices and is able to gain visibility in local markets. This process includes things like:

Building an organized site architecture
Optimizing site speed
Implementing structured data
Adding XML sitemaps
Removing duplicate content
Using language tags
Utilizing internal links
Setting up 404 pages & other redirects

All of these optimizations will improve the digital experience and make a website clean and organized for potential patients. Read our article “7 Essential Principles for Optimizing Your Website for Search” to get the best practices for building a search-optimized website. Without implementing a solid technical SEO strategy, your organization will struggle to rank for high-intent organic searches and build a dependable patient pipeline.
SEO Content Strategy
Once the technical foundation of the website has been established, the next step is to create rich SEO content that can be used across all brands within the platform. Develop content that addresses the questions and needs of potential patients at each stage of the patient journey. Having too little content on a website can make it difficult for Google to understand the website’s purpose and hinder its ranking potential for relevant search queries.
A great SEO content strategy includes creating original content that is easy to understand, straightforward, and optimized with target keywords, links, meta tags, etc.
Prioritize service and treatment pages as they will help to rank for middle-of-the-funnel (MOF) and bottom-of-the-funnel (BOF) search queries. This approach allows you to generate organic growth quickly.
 
Proficient Google Ads Strategy
You need a strong booking system in place before launching any promotional campaigns. This includes having a website or landing page that allows patients to book appointments through phone calls or online forms. Once the basic infrastructure is set up, focus on capturing existing demand by utilizing paid search through Google Ads. 
Targeting keywords that show intent to purchase such as “orthodontist near me” or “plastic surgeon in Atlanta” is a great way to generate leads quickly. As the platform grows, consider using remarketing campaigns to re-engage warm leads and target top-of-funnel campaigns to increase brand awareness and educate consumers about services.
Use paid search to capture bottom-of-the-funnel and middle-of-the-funnel search queries from healthcare consumers ready to buy.
To help you avoid that outcome, here is a five-pronged foundation for improving conversion performance and lead quality while increasing the return on investment (ROI) for your PPC program. 

 Choose the right account structure
 Focus on the quality of the conversion
 Optimize Your bidding strategy
 Build a funnel-based paid media strategy
 Nail your attribution profile

Marketing Tech Stack & Analytics
Having a centralized marketing technology system is crucial for the success of a multi-location healthcare organization. It’s essential to track the performance of strategies and their impact on patient outcomes. It allows marketers to streamline operations and save on costs by eliminating unnecessary systems. 
Additionally, it makes it simpler to incorporate new acquisitions by having a pre-established technology system and procedures in place. Marketers need to evaluate the effectiveness of their campaigns by looking at metrics such as cost per acquisition, retention rate, and the marketing channels that led to new patients. This is the heart of marketing measurement and using analytics can help healthcare marketers make the most of their budget.

Conversion Rate Optimization
Conversion rate optimization (CRO) is a process that aims to improve the effectiveness of a healthcare website in converting visitors into patients. It involves more than just making changes to design, analytics, or landing pages. CRO is about understanding what motivates healthcare consumers and using that understanding to create ads, landing pages, and content that appeals to these motivations. By doing so, healthcare providers can influence the actions of their website visitors and encourage them to take actions such as making an appointment or contacting them. In essence, CRO is about understanding human behavior and using that understanding to increase conversions on a healthcare website.
It is beneficial to focus on Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) as it can lead to significant improvements in the performance of a healthcare website. This marketing strategy can be especially impactful for mature accounts, as it can yield results that surpass those of other media optimizations. Says Rich Briddock, VP Analytics & Paid Media at Cardinal Digital Marketing during an episode of Ignite: Healthcare Marketing Podcast, “it’s absolutely worth it because you can see between two hundred to five hundred percent improvements with a sustained program.”

                    
                    
                    
                    To learn more, check out our podcast Intro to CRO: How Understanding Human Behavior Can Improve Conversion Rates.
                
Here are seven ways to start implementing CRO methodologies right now:
Make it easy to schedule an appointment.
Display the book-an-appointment button prominently on ads and websites and make it easy for patients to schedule appointments. The button should be sticky on every webpage and the same color throughout the website, to help train users to take a specific action. 
Keep an ear and eye out for common scheduling complaints and invest in tools such as call tracking software to analyze call data and search digital reviews for keywords related to the scheduling experience.
Provide more than one option to book.
In the end, your ad conversion rate might be suffering because you’re making the audience conform to what you want them to do rather than giving them options.
Provide the information people need to decide.
At a high level, patients have only a handful of needs when they reach a healthcare website. And if those needs aren’t met, user engagement—let alone a conversion—is improbable. In our recent in-depth look at How Patients Choose Healthcare Providers, we discuss these needs in detail, namely:

Insurance information (a very common need)
Locations (address, hours, contact info)
Appointment availability (accurate and easily accessible)
Services available (organized and easy to find)
Doctors (including reviews, ratings, and video introductions)
Reputation cues 

Optimize for mobile.
Ensure that your ads, creative, and landing pages are fast and optimized for mobile devices. You need to have a seamless mobile experience with easy-to-use click-to-call options and optimized online scheduling and forms. If you are not sure if your website is mobile-friendly, try accessing it on your smartphone and see if there are any issues with the mobile user experience.
Use social proof to your advantage.
Having social proof, such as reviews, ratings, and testimonials, is important in the healthcare industry as people tend to choose providers based on them. You should include available social proof in your digital presence, such as on your landing pages and website. Video testimonials are the most effective form of social proof, but photos and quotes also work.
Clarify your location.
Be clear and specific about the details of each location you have. Your website and landing pages should clearly list all of them, including the doctors, services, and scheduling options available at each one. Avoid any confusion or uncertainty.
Make text skimmable.
In order to effectively communicate important information to healthcare consumers who are searching for answers, present the information in an easy-to-read and well-organized format. This can be achieved by including rich details but presenting them in an organized manner with short headers, subheads, and bullet points.
Limit the length of headings and keep paragraphs and bullet points brief. Highlight key information using pull quotes, statistics, and social proof to make the information stand out.

Brand Architecture Strategy
The decision of whether to have a branded house or a house of brands is a common topic in the healthcare industry. This is extremely important when consolidating different healthcare groups or adding new brands to an existing group. A branded house approach means that all brands will be unified under one main brand, while a house of brands approach means that each brand will be kept separate and distinct from one another. 

Branded House Pros

Enjoy more efficient brand management strategies
Easier to build brand awareness
Business strategies are more scalable




Branded House Cons

Fragile reputation that relies on parent bond
Harder to earn trust from potential patients
New roadblocks with acquiring and integrating new brands




House of Brands Pros

More freedom to personalize messaging
Easier to acquire and integrate brands




House of Brands Cons

Less efficiency in day-to-day operations
Challenging to build brand awareness
Hard to analyze success over time




Choosing the “right” brand architecture ultimately depends on a variety of factors, such as the maturity of the market, competition, and the unique characteristics of each brand. Some markets may benefit from a single, unified brand, while others may perform better with separate brand identities. Consider all options and weigh the pros and cons before making a decision, and also keep in mind that the decision doesn’t have to be permanent. As the brand evolves, it may make sense to change the approach.
If you’re still unsure of which architecture style fits your healthcare organization, read our article “MSO Brand Management: One House vs. House of Brands?”
 
Digital Transformation in Healthcare Marketing
The future of healthcare is digital. While the healthcare industry has been slow to adopt technology due to concerns over patient privacy and established analog processes within organizations, groups are now investing in marketing and patient experience technologies. 
Private equity investment and consolidation are fueling technology adoption. To improve efficiency and reduce redundancy, healthcare groups are investing in marketing and patient experience/access technologies, including:

Centralized call centers
Online appointment booking
Centralized CRMs
Live chat and chatbots
Call tracking
Review generation technology

For healthcare organizations with multiple locations, having a centralized call center makes it simpler to answer frequent patient inquiries about insurance, hours of operation, and other related information. A centralized customer relationship management (CRM) system can also greatly improve operations by allowing stakeholders to easily access patient information, share it with patients, and send reminders as needed. 
Additionally, using the right CRM system not only increases efficiency but also helps the marketing team to create personalized experiences for patients, resulting in improved patient retention.
Let’s face it if you’re not taking advantage of digital solutions to streamline operations and control your digital presence you may as well be asking for potential patients to pass you by.

Scalable Multi-location Strategy
If you want to spark seamless growth, your healthcare marketing strategy needs to be completely scalable as you acquire new brands and open new locations. With the increasing reliance on technology and the internet in healthcare, it’s important to have a consistent marketing approach across all locations. A scalable strategy ensures that each location has access to the same resources and can execute the same tactics, while also allowing for local customization to better target specific audiences and address unique challenges. 
This helps to maintain a cohesive brand image and ensure that patients receive a consistent level of care and information, no matter which location they visit. By having a scalable digital marketing strategy, multi-location healthcare groups can increase their reach, improve patient engagement, and drive growth.
Cardinal collaborated with Reconstructive Surgery Alliance (ARSA) to build a scalable media strategy that could accommodate new brand acquisitions and their ambitious growth goals.
 
Provider Recruitment
Next to attracting new patients, the biggest challenge for many healthcare groups is provider recruitment. Jobs in the healthcare industry are increasing rapidly and are expected to grow by 13% through 2031. 
Provider and healthcare worker shortages have serious implications. Not only will it stall growth and limit your ability to take on new patients, but it can also impact patient care and your brand reputation. The good news? Marketing can make a significant difference by supporting provider recruitment strategies. 
Digital marketing can help you raise awareness of your brand on the digital platforms that potential candidates frequently use. Finding the ideal candidates for your healthcare organization isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The key to attracting top talent is creating a positive and appealing workplace culture. If your organization already has a great culture and a well-established operational system, don’t keep it a secret. Digital marketing can help you spread the word and attract more top talent. Here are 3 ways healthcare marketers can support and collaborate with recruitment teams to enhance their capabilities, improve patient satisfaction and treatment, and enhance the organization’s image:
Strengthen your Brand Reputation as an Employer
It’s crucial to think about the impression that your digital properties make on potential candidates. If a candidate’s first impression of your organization is negative, it will be difficult to convince them to apply. 
To ensure that your website and other digital properties effectively showcase your organization and culture, focus on presenting your brand values and culture. Make sure your career page is engaging and informative, highlighting benefits, insurance, time off, and awards. Use photos, videos, and quotes to give applicants a personal and clear understanding of your team and brand ethos. Consider taking inspiration from Cardinal’s About Us and Career pages.
Remove Job Application Barriers with Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)
Does your career page struggle with low engagement and high bounce rates? This could be due to a poor user experience. Make sure that the page is easy to navigate, and that the application process is not overly complicated. Remove any obstacles, such as confusing forms, slow-loading pages, or missing information that might be preventing candidates from applying. 
As we said before, CRO can help take your healthcare marketing strategy to the next level. To further improve the page’s performance, consider conducting conversion rate optimization (CRO) testing to see if there are any changes that can be made to increase the number of qualified applicants. These tests can help you determine what messaging and information is most compelling to potential hires, and whether offering perks like flexible work hours or work-from-home benefits would attract more applicants.
Your reputation matters to potential candidates. They’re looking for signs that you’re a trusted employer. These credibility factors include things like awards, certifications, and employee testimonials. For LifeStance Health, we conducted CRO tests to determine if adding the “Great Place to Work” certification badge to the careers site homepage hero section would improve application CVR.
Advertise to Create Touch Points Along the Job Candidate Journey
Google Ads can be effective in attracting job seekers who are actively searching for new job opportunities. To make the most out of your Google Ad campaign, it’s important to target relevant keywords, have a strong career page, and provide a smooth user experience for applicants. On the other hand, for those who are not actively searching for a job, social media advertising on platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram can help build brand awareness and a positive image. Video ads can be a powerful tool to show your brand’s culture, happy employees, and positive workplace experiences, making it easier to attract future applicants.
 
Patient-Centric Content
Patient-centric content is crucial for healthcare groups to attract new patients. By focusing on the needs and concerns of patients, healthcare providers can create content that is relevant and helpful to their target audience. This not only improves the user experience, but it also increases the chances that potential patients will find the information they need and choose to visit the provider for their healthcare needs. Additionally, by providing valuable information to potential patients, healthcare providers can establish trust and credibility, which can be key in building strong relationships with new patients.
Healthcare providers should have a comprehensive content strategy in place that addresses the questions and needs of their audience at all stages of the buying process, including the top and middle of the funnel. To optimize their approach, healthcare groups should consider implementing the following strategies:

Conducting patient research and surveying
Mapping the patient journey through all stages
Building out patient personas
Developing content strategy across the funnel

Adopting a content strategy that prioritizes the needs and concerns of patients can have long-term benefits for healthcare providers. By providing valuable and relevant information to potential patients, healthcare providers can attract new patients and build trust and credibility with them. This approach can ultimately lead to more patients seeking care from the provider and generate sustainable growth for the healthcare group in the long term.
 
Reputation Management
Many people today base their decisions on choosing a healthcare provider on information they find online. This includes visiting the provider’s website and reading reviews from others. According to a study by NRC Health, around 60% of patients have chosen a doctor based on positive reviews they found online. Healthcare brands often fall into the trap of complacency. They concentrate all their marketing efforts on promoting themselves through advertisements and external communications but ignore their online image.
A certain degree of reviews and engagement will naturally occur, but the amount of positive feedback you receive will depend on how established your brand is. Without taking proactive measures to increase positive reviews, you may end up with more negative ones. If not addressed, these negative perceptions can negatively impact your online reputation.
To mitigate this, there are three basic components to a comprehensive online reputation management program. This framework can help you increase patient reviews, enhance your online reputation across various platforms, and prevent negative reviews or a lack of reviews from deterring new patients.
Monitor and Manage Your Digital Profiles
Just like many digital marketing techniques, managing your online reputation starts with identifying what you already have. You need to determine the various digital profiles, websites, channels, and listings associated with your brand, both maintained by you or not. The places where your healthcare consumers go to read and write reviews about your brand should also be taken into consideration. Typically, this list may include the following channels:

General healthcare review websites (ZocDoc, RateMD, Vitals, Healthgrades)
Specialization-specific review sites (dentistry, plastic surgery, etc.)
Provider listings on healthcare networks, medical groups, and insurance groups
Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Google Search listings
Google My Business, Yelp, and Facebook Business
Embedded reviews and testimonials on your website
Social media profiles, such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube

Once you have identified all the components of your online presence, the next step is to create a plan to resolve any problems, prioritize what requires updating, and develop a response plan for reviews. It’s important to have clear guidelines that can be standardized and shared throughout your organization. These guidelines should include:

Creating and maintaining listings across all relevant channels
Who is in charge of monitoring and responding to reviews
How to handle negative reviews
How to respond to positive reviews
How to incorporate positive reviews and testimonials into your broader digital strategy
How to add approved testimonials and review to your website and social media channels
How to solicit reviews from patients

It’s also essential to establish your Google Business listing at minimum. For healthcare practices with multiple locations, set up a listing for each location. Google listings, along with location-specific webpages, play a vital role in managing your online reputation and optimizing your search visibility in local searches.


Develop a Review Generation Strategy
Have a regular influx of reviews to show that your business is actively engaged with customers and to provide recent feedback for potential patients searching for a new provider. 
To gain a consistent and high volume of reviews, it is necessary to have a structured and systematic approach within the organization to collect them. A few key principles of a successful review collecting are:

Map review requests to key points in the patient journey. These might be the transactional emails and automated messages you send after an appointment or procedure. Maybe you solicit reviews through a mobile app, or over the phone. Ask yourself which points in the journey will give you a consumer warm to the idea of leaving a review.
Train staff to ask for reviews. Give your staff members the script for when, where, and how to solicit reviews.
Share your review form widely. Consider including a link to your review form in your automated email messages, SMS text communications, and popular web pages to encourage more customers to review your business.
Automate your review solicitation program. There are great programs like BirdEye that can seamlessly integrate review solicitation with email, SMS, or even regular mail. Reputation management tools provide a great way to improve and monitor your digital reputation on an ongoing basis.

Automate your review solicitation using tools like Birdeye.
Strengthen your Website Presence
The reputation of a healthcare brand encompasses more than just business listings and online reviews. As previously mentioned, there are multiple ways for patients to reach your website. Regardless of how they arrive at your site, patients expect to find information and content that supports their decision to choose you.

Start with your about page: Many healthcare websites have unimpressive About pages, which is a missed opportunity. The About page is a chance to introduce patients to your team, and showcase your experience, background, and reputation. By putting a face to names and telling the story of how your practice was established and its mission, patients can get a better understanding of your brand.
Write patient-first mission and value statements: This same principle applies to your mission and values statements. Instead of using the generic statements found on most healthcare provider websites, write mission and value statements that focus on your patients’ needs. Consider partnering with an external agency to bring your mission, values, and other key brand statements to life on your website. The process of creating these statements can result in innovative ways to present this information across your various marketing platforms.
Showcase your positive reviews: It’s important to showcase positive reviews from your patients on your website. This helps potential patients see that others, similar to them, have had positive experiences with your healthcare services. You can include these testimonials throughout your site or on a dedicated page for patient reviews. By including reviews from various sources, such as Google and Facebook Business, you can build credibility and give visitors an idea of your reputation. Some healthcare brands are even making videos of post-op conversations and patient stories to give a more in-depth look at their services.

Creating Great Patient Experiences
The patient experience now mostly takes place online and has become a crucial aspect in healthcare. With advancements in digital healthcare, patients expect a seamless and hassle-free online experience. In competitive healthcare markets, a positive patient experience can help distinguish a brand, build a good reputation, and gain more referrals. 
Here are some surefire ways digital marketing can remove barriers, ease frustrations, and make it easy for patients to get the care they need:

Optimize your website for mobile
Create a Google Business Profile
Build out a more robust website
Offer multiple ways to schedule appointments
Send automated reminders
Educate through content
Consider a chatbot

With a focus on building a scalable website platform, a strong SEO foundation, and a proficient Google Ads strategy, healthcare providers can increase their online visibility and attract more patients. 
The use of marketing technology and analytics, as well as conversion rate optimization, helps healthcare providers track their marketing performance and make informed decisions. Creating patient-centric content, adopting digital, and implementing a provider recruitment strategy, are also key to providing great patient experiences and maintaining a positive reputation. By following these best practices, healthcare providers can increase their success in the competitive world of healthcare marketing.

                    One of our core values at Cardinal is that we never settle. We chase growth and new challenges, and never back down in our pursuit of expanding our knowledge and capabilities. Over the last 17 years, we’ve put this belief into practice as Cardinal has grown into a recognized leader in healthcare performance marketing. As our industry continues to evolve, so do we.  
Going forward, Cardinal will operate as Power Digital Marketing’s dedicated healthcare division.
We step into this next phase of our evolution, maintaining the same leadership, team, culture, and healthcare-first mission, now supported by Power’s enterprise-grade data intelligence and measurement capabilities designed to scale what already works.



 
Intentional evolution
First things first, this is not an integration nor is it a shift away from who we are. In fact, it’s the opposite. 
Over the years, Cardinal has chosen to specialize where others generalized. We’ve built deep expertise in HIPAA-compliant marketing environments, regulatory nuance, and the realities of scaling complex, multi-location healthcare organizations. We’ve pioneered measurement approaches grounded in healthcare reality, not marketing theory.
Our partnership with Power is confirmation that, when it comes to healthcare marketing, specialization wins. It’s a strategic step forward, rooted in a shared belief that deep specialization is not a limitation, it’s a vital competitive advantage.
Because our entire focus is healthcare, our team brings deep mastery of HIPAA-regulated environments, multi-site and multi-brand operations, complex patient journeys, and vertical-specific consumer behavior. Power complements this with consumer data and audience intelligence, advanced forecasting, and high-velocity testing and experimentation that strengthen our healthcare-specific insights. 
Cardinal’s healthcare authority is now amplified by Power’s enterprise-grade measurement and data intelligence.
 
Preserving focus while expanding capabilities 
Power is built as a collection of deeply specialized vertical divisions, supported by a shared enterprise intelligence layer—data science, experimentation, measurement, and technology—designed to raise the ceiling without diluting focus.
This structure matters because it preserves what has made us an authority in the healthcare marketing space. Specialization is an asset. With Power, we remain autonomous and deeply domain-specific, while gaining access to an enterprise intelligence layer that amplifies our expertise.
That philosophy mirrors our own belief: specialization should lead, intelligence should support. In other words, Power Digital’s role is not to redefine Cardinal’s expertise. It’s to extend our impact.
As a result of this acquisition, we now have access to advanced, enterprise-level capabilities that strengthen healthcare outcomes across the full lifecycle, including:

AI-informed intelligence that helps healthcare leaders move from attribution uncertainty to confident investment decisions
High-velocity experimentation that allows teams to gain deeper audience and channel understanding and the ability to capitalize on winning strategies
Cross-vertical insight, applied thoughtfully and compliantly to healthcare’s increasingly consumerized landscape

This partnership gives our clients a strategic advantage as we’re able to apply deeper intelligence to the work we’ve always done and to bring greater clarity to measurement and more precision to optimization without sacrificing the nuance or compliance that healthcare demands.
While Cardinal continues to bring deep understanding and expertise in all things healthcare, Power brings advanced measurement, intelligent insights grounded in broader consumer demand patterns, and enterprise-level conversation rate optimization that most competitors just don’t have.
For healthcare organizations, the value of this partnership shows up before campaigns launch, and remains long after patients convert. Clearer insights, stronger forecasting, ongoing optimization, and continuous learning loops that strengthen conversion rates, elevate patient experience, and compound performance improvements over time.
All this enables more informed, defensible marketing decisions that translate into sustainable patient growth.
 
What this means for healthcare marketers
Like everything we do at Cardinal, this decision is strategic, intentional, and timely. 
Healthcare marketing is at an inflection point. As Lauren Leone, Healthcare Division President, explains: 
“The demand for more advanced measurement and multi-channel thinking has  finally arrived, and we’re watching in real time as healthcare becomes just as sophisticated as any other vertical.”
Patient discovery is becoming more fragmented by AI. Measurement expectations are rising, even as data signals grow more complex. Attribution blindness is limiting confidence in investment decisions. Budgets are tighter, scrutiny is higher, and expectations for measurement, forecasting, and ROI have risen sharply. Healthcare organizations are under pressure to make smarter, more defensible investment decisions while maintaining trust and regulatory responsibility.
In this environment, specialization alone isn’t enough. And neither is scale without context. The future of healthcare requires both deep vertical expertise and advanced intelligence to support it. 
Currently, most healthcare organizations can’t clearly connect marketing activity to patient volume, and most marketing agencies can’t guide them through that complexity. Our deep expertise, when paired with Power Digital’s advanced enterprise-grade measurement capabilities, creates a partnership for exactly this moment. 
 
Same mission, but with more power 
As we considered Cardinal’s future, the question was never whether we should grow. The question was how to grow without compromising the principles that have allowed us to deliver meaningful results for our clients. We were not looking to be absorbed, consolidated, or diluted. We were looking for one thing: a way to increase our impact without sacrificing our focus.
That’s why we chose Power Digital. 
Power chose Cardinal because they believe in our approach, our people, and what we’ve built.  As Jeff Mason, CEO of Power Digital, shared:
“We believe the future belongs to specialists supported by enterprise intelligence. Cardinal is exactly that, a healthcare-first team that earned its authority by solving problems others avoid. Our role is not to change Cardinal. It is to amplify what already makes them exceptional at the moment healthcare needs it most.”
That perspective reflects how we see this next chapter as well. And we’re confident that this partnership will allow us to meet that moment, head on. 
 
Looking ahead to shape the future
Our mission remains the same: connecting patients with care. Our role remains the same: helping healthcare organizations grow responsibly, measurably, and sustainably in an increasingly complex marketing environment. The core values that have shaped our agency and our work remain non-negotiable.
What changes is our ability to do that work with greater confidence and sophistication, as we help to shape the future of healthcare marketing. Healthcare deserves specialists, and specialists deserve enterprise-grade intelligence. Together with Power Digital, we can deliver on both.

                            Our PPC campaigns are so effective because they’re powered by people and perfected by algorithms. We leverage powerful AI and machine learning to improve performance while doing what humans do best (i.e. the strategy, competitive research, messaging, copywriting, design, data analysis, and trend forecasting that go behind effective campaigns). Human brilliance meets digital innovation: that’s how we deliver more leads with lower CPA, every time. 
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Multi-Location Account Structure Optimization
                        
                            Our deep-rooted technical Google Ads expertise enables us to develop optimized account structures for multi-location organizations that result in better efficiency and better lead quality. We build consolidated search campaigns to maximize smart bidding performance, feeding the Google algorithm more data so it can optimize for the highest quality conversions. When necessary, we also segment campaigns to control budgets by region, so you can hit your individual target CPA goals.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        HIPAA-Compliant Lead Tracking
                        
                            At Cardinal, we’re able to track more than just form fills and calls. Leveraging HIPAA-compliant technology, we empower better decision-making by helping you tie downstream activity—like kept appointments and other patient outcomes—to specific marketing exposures. Our closed-loop system also integrates with custom CRMs and patient management systems, providing various attribution models for reporting that help us understand whether upper and mid-funnel media drives pre-conversion exposures. 
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Patient-Centric Keyword Strategies
                        
                            Keywords are the fundamental building blocks of your PPC strategy. Excellent keyword coverage ensures visibility on all relevant terms, while robust negative lists and match type management reduce spend against irrelevant queries. We’ll also segment keywords by intent, so that the most relevant experience can be delivered to the end user. Ultimately, we strive to fully understand the patient journey to inform user-centric messaging across each and every touchpoint.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Value-Based Tracking
                        
                            We don’t just generate leads for kicks. We generate leads with strategy and intention, garnering only those most likely to convert and bring with them the most revenue. (Again, we’re results-obsessed here, not just results-oriented.)
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Post-Click Optimization
                        
                            Most PPC agencies spend the lion’s share of their resources on pre-click optimization. Not us. We dedicate time and resources to optimize the post-click experience, too, because we know it’s just as important to a successful PPC campaign. We ensure the entire patient journey is optimized for conversions, including your post-click landing page, to inspire meaningful action across each of your audience segments. 
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Funnel-Based Messaging Strategies
                        
                            We can deploy funnel-based nurture strategies for more complex, high acuity patient journeys—including remarketing to patients. We view the customer journey from a holistic, 360-degree angle, enabling us to nurture relationships and build a better brand experience for audience members at each stage of the funnel.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        HIPAA Compliant Remarketing
                        
                            Your typical prospect could take weeks— if not months—to compare multiple providers online before making a final decision. That’s why we deploy fast, effective remarketing campaigns across display, paid social, and native to ensure the widest reach with your warmest prospects, no matter where they are on the web. We use time on page and scroll depth triggers to create warmer remarketing audiences and increase frequency against these pools. What’s more, we buy directly with a DSP without healthcare industry restrictions to allow the broadest reach possible for remarketing audiences.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Robust Copy Testing
                        
                            The best copy out there is tested, tested some more, and then tested again. That’s exactly what we do to ensure your ads are getting the results you’re after. Testing our creative via RSAs allows us to do so at a granular level and at a much higher velocity, maximizing your campaign ROI by putting laser-precise copy in front of each of your audience segments.

                PPC Frequently Asked  Questions  

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                        What is PPC and why should you consider it for your business?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Pay-per-click (PPC) is an advertising strategy that places ad content at the top of search results pages for certain keywords. Usually, these are high-volume keywords your target audience is searching for. Each time someone clicks that PPC ad, the company pays Google for the click. PPC cost per click (CPC) is based on how difficult it is to rank for a given keyword. The more competition there is to rank for that keyword, the higher the CPC. Getting this right and not blowing your budget on paid search is definitely a science — and luckily, it just so happens to be our specialty.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can my competitors target my branded keywords with PPC?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, this is a common tactic. Savvy competitors will not only bid for their own branded keywords but will pay to rank for the branded keywords of their competitors. That means that potential and existing customers looking for you on Google could see an ad from your competitor first. While this is perfectly legal—albeit in a bit of a gray area—there are several solutions to overcome this tactic. (Psst: our Google Adwords services can help!)
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What kind of ROI can I expect from a PPC company like Cardinal?
                                            
                    
                        
                            At Cardinal, we don’t make lofty or unattainable promises. Our approach is to optimize your PPC campaigns based on existing data, industry expertise, and proven best practices — all while adhering to your budgetary guidelines. From there, our team of PPC experts measure, monitor, and optimize your PPC strategy, so you get the most bang for your PPC buck.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Is the quality of PPC traffic worth the investment?
                                            
                    
                        
                            It’s our goal to drive valuable clicks and qualified leads to your website without getting too spendy. We do that by excluding negative keywords from your campaigns (keywords that are likely to attract unqualified clicks and website traffic). Employed correctly, PPC can deliver faster results than SEO, which is a much longer (but still very necessary) SEM strategy. What’s more, PPC offers a distinct opportunity to directly engage prospects where they are — Google — with targeted ad copy that speaks directly to their pain points.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Why do people click PPC ads?
                                            
                    
                        
                            To be frank, most people who click on PPC ads don’t actually know they’re clicking on an ad. That’s because PPC ads always appear in “position zero” above regular search results. Our PPC experts know how to craft eye-catching messaging for these ads that drive qualified clicks, because at the end of the day, it’s strong messaging that drives clicks.

                Performance creative isn’t guesswork—it’s a science. Guided by testing roadmaps, we relentlessly test ad variations, messaging, and visuals to find what engages patients and drives conversions. Each test builds on the last, ensuring continuous improvement.
Test, learn, optimize, repeat. That’s our approach to delivering media strategies that drive real results.

                Understanding your patients is the first step to better ad creative. We go beyond guesswork, using surveys, voice-of-the-client interviews, and patient journey mapping to uncover what truly drives their decisions.
By identifying motivations, barriers, and key touchpoints, we help you craft creative that resonates at every stage of the journey. The result? Stronger engagement, greater brand trust, and ads that drive action.

                            Performance creative refers to a data-driven approach to how we develop, deploy, and optimize creative content for digital marketing campaigns. This content includes static and dynamic visual assets (e.g., programmatic display ads), conversion-optimized landing pages, video content, and overall creative strategy.
At the core of our integrated, cross-channel approach to performance creative is a relentless commitment to continuous improvement: our channel experts use a rigorous testing framework to iteratively improve content and campaigns across your channel investments, up and down your marketing funnel.

                            Our research process centers around the patient audiences you need to reach, as well as your brand’s unique selling proposition(s). We help you identify your ideal patients and unique selling proposition by conducting thorough audience research, surveys, and voice-of-the-client interviews. We also bring clarity to the patient journey, because any misstep can lead a prospect away from your brand. Our team maps different patient journeys to uncover intrinsic motivations, preferences, and influences. Finally, our research-based approach gives you a clear framework to create persuasive messaging that communicates your brand’s unique selling proposition. From your website to ads, your message will resonate with patients and motivate them to seek care.

                    Every day, healthcare marketers waste ad dollars sending patients to locations that don’t have room for them. At best, it’s inefficient. At worst, it erodes consumer trust.
If you’re running ads without knowing whether a location has the capacity to accept new patients, you’re throwing money down the drain—and possibly driving future patients straight into the arms of your competitors.
 
What We Mean by “Capacity”
In healthcare, capacity is defined by many names: provider utilization, appointment availability, and access. No matter what your organization calls it, capacity boils down to a simple question: Can we take on more patients at this location, right now?
Operations usually knows the answer. But marketing often doesn’t. That disconnect is a major problem when your job is to drive growth.
 
The Cost of Misalignment
When marketing isn’t aligned with capacity, several things go wrong:

You waste budget. Every dollar spent advertising an overbooked practice is a dollar you could have used to fill chairs at a location with availability.
You lose patients. People don’t wait. If your ad convinces them to book, but they can’t be seen for six weeks, they’ll find another provider who can.
You damage your brand. Consumers associate long waits and limited access with poor service. That frustrates them and devalues your brand.

“It begins and ends with access… you’re not selling false expectations… so that the expectation you’re setting from the beginning remains true to the encounters they’re going to have.” —Alvaro Fernandez, Service Line Marketing Director, CHRISTUS Health.
 
What Capacity-Driven Strategy Looks Like in Action
Capacity-aligned marketing starts with a shared framework—one that helps both marketing and operations understand where patient demand exists, where provider availability is limited, and how those realities should shape your media strategy. That framework doesn’t have to be high-tech or complicated to be effective. The best approach is the one you can consistently act on.
Work with your operations team to figure out what’s practical today, not someday. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of progress—some data is better than none, and strong alignment beats sophisticated tech. Don’t forget that a well-designed Excel sheet can be a powerful tool. 
What works for your group may differ from others. The key is to get on the same page about how you’re defining capacity and what marketing should do with that information.

Take North American Dental Group, a 200+ location DSO. Their team developed a quadrant system to visualize how patient demand and operational capacity should guide marketing investments. It gave them an at-a-glance view of which locations warranted high, medium, or minimal media spend, and where operational fixes were needed before marketing could make an impact.
Empower Behavioral Health, an ABA therapy provider, took a different approach. They built a simple three-tier model that categorized locations by waitlist depth, client discharge rates, and staffing status. The tiering system directly informed budget allocation and helped avoid wasted ad spend.
Whether it’s a quadrant, three-tier, or high- and low-priority framework, the goal is the same: make capacity actionable. Set benchmarks, define escalation rules, and revisit regularly. For example, if the providers hit 90% utilization, shift it to a lower investment tier. If new appointment slots open up, reevaluate.
What matters most is building a shared framework—and using it to guide real decisions.
 
How to Get Started: Align with Operations
You don’t need a high-tech dashboard to get started. Yes, some systems have integrated tools where marketing can see wait times and appointment availability in real time. But even a manual approach works and is better than doing nothing.
Here are a few ways to build alignment around capacity:

Start with shared definitions. Agree on what having “capacity” means. Is it open appointment slots? Specific provider utilization thresholds? Equipment or room utilization rates? Getting aligned on language is the first step.
Ask Ops for a location-level snapshot. Request a list that includes current provider schedules, average appointment lag times, and any known bottlenecks.
Create a simple tiering system. Red = overbooked, Yellow = near capacity, Green = room to grow. This helps quickly identify where to invest—and where to pause.
Set thresholds. For example: “We won’t increase the paid media budget for a location unless they have at least 10 open appointment slots in the next 3 weeks.”
Establish a cadence. Hold monthly or bi-weekly syncs with ops. Capacity changes fast, and media plans need to keep pace.
Integrate data where you can. Even a shared spreadsheet or simple dashboard can help teams stay aligned.

“It’s about effective communication, data utilization, and a shared goal for sustainable growth, maintaining program quality, and delivering the experience our consumers expect.” —Mari Considine, Chief Marketing & Development Officer at Acenda Integrated Health.
 
A Common Friction Point: “We Want Growth, But We’re Not Open”
One of the trickiest challenges marketers face is when practices or providers say they want more patients, but their schedules tell a different story. A provider might say, “Yes, I want to grow and take on more patients,” but only opens one or two new appointment slots a week. In that case, marketing can’t realistically deliver meaningful volume.
This is where tight alignment between marketing, operations, and clinical teams is essential. Everyone needs to understand what level of access is required to meet shared growth goals. If your goal is 20 new patients this month, but you’re only opening five slots, there’s a disconnect.
Getting aligned means:

Being honest about true availability at the provider level
Defining realistic volume goals based on access
Ensuring operational teams are willing and able to flex schedules to support growth

“You think you want to grow, but your providers aren’t actually accepting new patients.”
As Kristina Dover, Mercy’s CMO, explains, transparency and pre-alignment with operations are essential: “We provided operations with tools to show where access was needed before we went live in a market. Once we gave that transparency, our operational leaders really partnered with us—we set thresholds for when we would see patients and when new appointment availability was needed before marketing would launch. Once they opened it up, we turned on the marketing.”
This kind of two-way planning builds trust and prevents wasted effort on all sides.

What to Do Next: Loop In Your Agency
If you work with a media agency, make sure they have access to capacity data, too. That could mean:

Monthly updates from your team on priority locations
A shared scorecard that tracks capacity and media spend side-by-side
Shared rules of engagement—e.g., “Only deploy campaigns if capacity is green”

Without this context, your agency is flying blind. With it, they can prioritize investments where you’ll see the highest return.
 
Final Thought: Efficiency Over Everything
Capacity-aligned marketing isn’t just a smart move—it’s essential. You’re not just optimizing the budget; you’re protecting your brand, improving the patient experience, and supporting system-wide growth goals.
If you haven’t had the capacity conversation yet, now is the time. Talk to operations. Share your goals. Build a plan. And then make sure your agency is ready to act on it.
Otherwise, you’re just pouring budget down the drain.

                                                            With healthcare’s pivotal shift towards consumerization, many physicians and practitioners have struggled to attract new patients and grow their practices. The days of a physician-focused market are slowly fading as patients become empowered to take control of their healthcare journey. Healthcare providers need a comprehensive marketing plan to stay competitive in this ever-changing industry. Below are several proven health advertising tactics to help grow your practice.

                    In the past, health services were deeply rooted in tradition, where physicians and medical practitioners relied on firmly established advertising techniques, like print, TV, radio, referrals, and so on. As a result, providers can manage a profitable patient pipeline just by being able to provide care services. However, with the internet and evolving consumer behavior, you need a comprehensive digital marketing plan to attract new patients and grow your practice.Table of Contents1.

Today, modern patients are more in-tuned with their roles as healthcare consumers. Armed with the power of the internet, patients are empowered to take control and find information about their healthcare–from their symptoms to potential treatments to nearby providers. This highlights the importance of adopting digital solutions for successful audience engagements.
Modern health advertising is more than just selling your medical products and services; you must find new ways to reach and engage with your patient base. Below are time-tested healthcare advertising tactics for increasing patient volume and achieving growth targets.
 
1. Audit Your Healthcare Website
You can’t succeed in health advertising without a solid foundation. This is where your healthcare website comes in. Like your physical locations, such as clinics and health centers, your digital presence must have a firm footing to grow. For most patients, your medical website will be their first interaction with your brand, and it’s a golden chance to make a great first impression.
As such, you need a well-optimized website that makes it easy to convert visitors into patients and rank well on search engines like Google. What makes good web design? Consider the following factors when auditing your website:

Design: Simply put, your medical website must look professional, modern, and good-looking. Otherwise, you’ll lose patients before they even step inside your clinic. 38% of users say they won’t bother engaging with a poorly-designed website.
User experience: Although the design of your website is crucial, you’re not doing your brand any favors with a website that’s hard to use, understand, or navigate. This means you should have intuitive layouts, pages with consistent branding, clear menus, easy-to-read fonts, and original professional images.
Content: While it’s true that content is still king, avoid doing content just for the sake of it. Create content with patient-centricity in mind, meaning you should strive to provide real-world value to visitors through your content and messaging. A solid content library will help establish trust and credibility toward your brand.
Site speed: Did you know that 1 in 4 visitors will leave if a website takes more than 4 seconds to load? The longer the pages load, the more the bounce rates skyrocket. And higher bounce rates tell Google that users don’t find your website useful, so your SEO will also suffer. Use tools like PageSpeed Insights to audit your web pages’ speed.
Mobile-friendliness: In 2023, mobile devices like smartphones account for 60.67% of all web traffic, highlighting the importance of a mobile-friendly website. Employ responsive design to ensure your website displays properly, regardless of where it’s viewed.


 
2. Focus on Patient Centricity
In a consumer-driven healthcare market where patients want to be engaged, you need a patient-centric marketing campaign based on your target audience’s unique medical needs and preferences.
With patient-centric marketing, you aim to engage and provide value to your patients by educating them. This is where high-quality educational content shines. Your content strategy must involve informative medical content, such as information about specific illnesses, diseases, or things people can expect about the services/treatments you provide.
Focusing on patient-centricity will put your practice in a better position to engage your patients, enabling them to trust your brand and hopefully convert.
 
3. Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile
Like many healthcare providers, your practice likely relies on attracting patients within your geographical area. Having said that, one of the most effective ways to boost your local presence is Google Business Profile or GBP. This SERP (search engine results page) feature doesn’t just impact your search rankings, but it’s also the first thing potential patients may see when searching for a local provider.
GBP is essentially a local listing tied to your physical location, like a dental office or outpatient clinic, and it’s how Google validates your practice. Optimizing your GBP listing is relatively straightforward; you just need to provide accurate and timely information about your practice, such as:

Name of practice
Location
Phone number
Business hours
Email address
Website
Appointment link
Photo of your facility and staff
Short description of your practice

In addition, you can further optimize your GBP by adding a section for frequently asked questions or FAQs. You can include questions commonly asked by your patients, like accepted insurance, payment options, and availability. Finally, make it SOP to ask patients to leave reviews through your Google profile.
 
4. Connect With Patients Via Social Media
Social media is an incredible way to reach and connect with patients and attract more people to your healthcare brand. Although there’s no shortage of social media platforms to choose from, you don’t have to join them all. The most important thing here is to be present in platforms relevant to your ideal patient personas.
Once you categorize your patient personas, you’ll determine who they are, what they have in common, and their challenges. After honing in on your relevant patient personas, you’ll know exactly where they find healthcare information and advice. This is important because 90% of Americans use social media to find healthcare information instead of talking to their primary care physician.
Aside from community building and patient engagement, you can leverage social media for paid social advertising. For example, you can use Facebook Ads to send funnel-based messaging strategies to reach patients and send them the right message at the right time, depending on where they are on the funnel.

 
5. Boost Your Local Search Presence with SEO
Despite brand consolidations and private equity acquisitions, healthcare has always been a local service at its core. As such, healthcare marketers require a comprehensive and scalable local SEO strategy to build their local organic search presence and attract new patients.
Use Geographical Keywords
For starters, your marketing team needs a geographical keyword strategy. Geographical or location-based keywords are generally bottom of funnel (BOF) keywords. These high-intent keywords target people who are a few steps away from booking an appointment or visiting your physical location. Some examples of high-intent geographical keywords are:

best cardiologist fort worth tx
24 hour animal hospital jacksonville fl
Skagit valley wa hospital nutrition
Aba therapy near me
cancer screening program Atlanta ga
kaiser permanente adhd screening

When selecting the keywords to optimize, go for solution-aware keywords that align with your specialty services and treatments and your accepted insurance programs. Optimizing for high-intent keywords will help capture highly qualified leads ready for their first appointment.
Create Geo-Targeted Websites and Landing Pages
When it comes to healthcare, patients want personalized experiences. And when they search for a local provider, they want to know about location-specific information, not just generic content. Patients who don’t find what they’re looking for will bounce off your website.
People want a good experience when browsing a landing page. In this scenario, the algorithm will determine that your website or landing page isn’t the best match for the patient’s search intent, severely impacting your search rankings. On a related note, we see one of the most common relevancy mismatches when companies link their ads to generic home or service pages.
Thus, multi-location healthcare groups should invest in developing individual geo-optimized websites and landing pages for each location. The characteristics of a good landing page experience include the following:

Follows up on the “promises” on the ads
Speaks to patient motivations and their challenges
Answers relevant questions and creates clarity
Provides a clear path to conversion
Provides a fast and intuitive browsing experience

Invest in these dedicated, well-optimized pages, boost your local search presence, and improve patient engagement through personalized, high-quality digital experiences.
 
6. Invest in Paid Search Advertising
A fully-realized local SEO campaign with a robust PPC or Google Ads campaign with high-intent, location-based keywords are a match made in heaven. Paid search remains one of the fastest ways for providers to put their practice in front of high-value leads–aka potential patients searching for health services.
Choose the Appropriate Account Structure
Nowadays, Google Ads are driven mainly by automated bidding systems. Instead of relying on human input, marketers leverage automation for more optimized and strategic bids. However, you can’t just set your campaign to auto-pilot and expect your campaign to take off. A suitable account structure is what you need to take advantage of Smart Bidding fully.
We’ve had great success with hybrid accounts for multi-location healthcare organizations because it gives us the best characteristics of segmented and consolidated ad groups. Better budget control and hyper-targeted audience from segmentation? Check. Maximized ad impressions like with consolidated accounts? Absolutely!
Align Keywords with Patient Journey Funnel
Successful PPC campaigns have implemented the alignment of keywords along the search intent funnel. Are you familiar with Google’s Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT)? Modern consumers are more tech-savvy and discerning regarding healthcare providers, so they will research before making an appointment. Afterward, the patient’s journey starts and slowly moves through the funnel.
The idea is to capture and engage patients in each stage of the buyer’s journey, which can be achieved by building a conversion funnel. Your PPC team must create a diverse set of keywords and content that satisfies search intent and meets patient needs along the funnel. If you’re successful, you can send the correct type of message at the right time and to the right audience.
As an example, here’s what your conversion funnel would look like:

Top of funnel or problem-aware leads: These patients are in the ZMOT research and solution discovery phase. They have concerns about their health (e.g., chronic pain, anxiety episodes, etc.) but can’t tell if they need to see a medical professional yet. In this phase, your ads should incorporate educational keywords like “how to live with chronic pain and depression.”
Mid-funnel or solution-aware leads: These patients have decided to talk to a physician but are still determining which treatments or services they need. In this phase, target educational keywords about your services or treatments, like “what happens at your first pain management appointment.”
Bottom of funnel or product-aware leads: These patients are ready to see a doctor and are ripe for conversion. This is where you can utilize high-intent keywords of location identifiers, such as “pain management doctors horizon nj health.”

Whether or not you decide to focus your marketing efforts on the top or bottom of the funnel will depend on your business’s unique goals.
 
7. Manage Your Online Reputation
It’s time to stop relying on word of mouth and referrals to attract new patients into your practice. Instead, letting your online reputation speak for your brand would be best. 94% of consumers use online reviews to evaluate healthcare providers, which is a big wake-up call to get your digital reputation in order. Furthermore, 84% of patients trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations, so a strong reputation management strategy is vital.
How to Get More Reviews for Your Practice?
The best and most reliable way to generate patient reviews is to simply ask them. I know that asking patients for reviews isn’t rocket science, but you should have SOPs for gathering reviews. For starters, you should train your patient-facing staff members (e.g., receptionists, billing, nurse assistants, etc.) on the best practices for collecting reviews. A good approach is to let patients know how reviews immensely impact your practice. In reality, those who are satisfied with their care will gladly help you and leave a review about their experience.
However, since you’re essentially asking patients for a favor, ensure the process of leaving reviews must be as easy and pain-free as possible. For starters, provide options about where patients can leave their reviews, including your GBP listing, website, follow-up emails, and short surveys. Otherwise, not many people will be compelled to provide feedback.
In addition, organizations should devise a response plan to online feedback. Designate a team to monitor all conversations about your brand and determine your practice’s positions regarding positive and negative feedback. For positive reviews, you can thank the reviewer for entrusting you with their care.
It gets more tricky with negative reviews, but don’t shy away from responding to them. Apologize for the poor experience or discomfort caused by the incident, and explain your side with a firm but apologetic tone. Then, thank the reviewer for their feedback and the opportunity to address a potential issue. Responding to and managing negative reviews can potentially double patient satisfaction.
 
8. Leverage Video Marketing on TikTok
When it comes to engaging content, the video format remains one of the best storytelling mediums. Video marketing is your best bet if you want to get people’s attention and drive engagement.
With more than a billion active users, TikTok is one the largest and most active social media platforms today – and it happens to be an excellent network for video marketing. Although TikTok is known for fun, short, and entertaining content, it has evolved into a legitimate video marketing platform.
But why TikTok?
TikTok has filled the gap left by Meta by providing robust options for connecting and engaging patients and care provider communities. For starters, TikTok is by far the most engaging social media platform, with an average session length of 10.85 minutes. Plus, it offers one thing that other social media platforms don’t – native targeting options available to health advertisers.
With TikTok advertising, you can produce creative videos designed to engage patients at every step of the buyer journey. The key is to create authentic content that resonates with your audience and showcases your personality. Plus, you can always repurpose your TikTok content for other platforms since they play off each other so well.
One of the best ways to approach TikTok advertising is by activating disease state awareness (DSA) campaigns. Since brand advertising is still limited on the platform, your practice can shine through DSA content which is permissible by TikTok.
 
Conclusion
Developing a fully-realized health advertising campaign is more than daunting, it’s a challenge. However, you can start your campaign by adopting the strategies outlined above. Regardless of the strategy you wish to adopt for growing your practice, remember that your patients should always be the focus.

                    7 Ways Digital Marketing Can Improve The Patient Experience

                                            
                                                            When it comes to improving the patient experience, there are some simple strategies that many healthcare providers overlook. Here’s a look at what other practices are doing that you might be missing, as well as the core digital experiences that today’s patients expect.

                    These days, much of the patient experience begins and ends online. This is especially true in light of the ways digital healthcare has evolved, including online appointment scheduling, patient portals, and telehealth. As a result, patients expect low-friction digital experiences across the board. Moreover, patients consider digital channels as essential parts of their healthcare decision-making processes. In competitive healthcare markets, patient experience can be how you distinguish your brand, build a strong reputation, and get more referrals. This article shares a few ways your digital marketing team can help improve the patient experience by removing barriers, easing frustrations, and making it easy for patients to get the care they need.Table of Contents1.

1. Optimize Your Website for Mobile
In Healthcare Marketing for a Mobile-First World, we wrote at length about the opportunity cost of failing to prioritize mobile experiences. As some of the data we shared shows, you need to build website experiences with exceptional mobile user experience (UX); otherwise, people won’t use your website.
When we say optimize your site for mobile, we mean the whole kit and kaboodle. That means mobile-friendly code, navigation, and design from top-to-bottom—on each page, interaction, process, form, video, portal, and so on. For larger websites or multi-location healthcare entities, this can be a time- and cost-intensive undertaking. However, the long-term cost of failing to meet new consumer demand for mobile-optimized experiences is too steep to risk.
Step one? Take your site for a spin on your own mobile device. Put yourself in the shoes of a patient. I suspect it won’t be long before you identify where mobile users might be getting hung up.
 
2. Create a Great Google My Business (GMB) Listing
“Googling stuff” might sound like a silly phrase, but it’s often the first step that healthcare consumers take when seeking a provider online. One of the things those consumers will likely come across is a GMB listing. A GMB listing is essentially a business profile, which can include contact information, site links, photos, reviews, and so on. The more complete your listing, the better, as these listings are often embedded in Google Search experiences.
Here’s a look at a well-optimized Google My Business listing:
Optimize your Google My Business profile to ensure patients can find all of the information they need to make a decision.
Your GMB profile is often the first thing patients find when they search for you. Your job is to ensure that healthcare consumers—new and returning—can find everything they need from you. Don’t make them hunt for information! Here are a few tips from our recent blog post, How to Optimize Your Google My Business Listing:

Check to see if you already have listings you can work with
Establish a Google account and Google My Business profile for each of your locations
Optimize your listing by completing as much information as possible, including site links, service descriptions, photos and videos, promotions, and contact information
Regularly revisit, revise, and update your listing with new posts, photos, etc.
Respond to reviews both positive and negative

 
3. Build Out a More Robust Website
Your website is more than a marketing tool. It’s an opportunity to constantly create value for your new and prospective customers/patients. Think about the kinds of needs, questions, and objections that healthcare consumers have within your specific niche. What information, for instance, does a person considering cosmetic surgery need to know? What kind of information will help someone living with a particular condition improve their quality of life?
Your website content, including dedicated pages, blog posts, video content, testimonials, should offer detailed information on conditions, services, etc. Not only do patients want this, so does Google! Publishing authoritative, well-structured website content can indeed improve both patient experience and SEO simultaneously.

4. Offer Multiple Ways to Schedule an Appointment
The first step in getting more patients to walk through your doors is to let them know you want them to contact you and schedule an appointment. But this is an opportunity to go beyond simply listing your phone number on your website. Remember that a lot of people prefer not to call healthcare providers at all.
You’ll increase conversions when you give patients multiple ways to schedule an appointment on your website. 
 
Instead, incorporate all of your methods of contact throughout your website, GMB listing, and so on. Here are some ideas on how to do so:

Click-to-call or click-to-text phone number
Click-to-email email address
Traditional contact form
Links to social media channels
A dedicated contact page with all methods of contact listed
Easy navigation to your patient portal for direct communication with a physician

Naturally, the options you present for contact and appointment scheduling ought to follow the principles of mobile optimization and mobile UX.
 
5. Send Automated Reminders
I’ll be honest: I forget my dentist appointments all the time. Who can remember an appointment they made six months ago!? My saving grace is nearly always the automated reminders my provider sends me a couple of days in advance of my appointment.
It’s funny how big a win it can be just to remind patients to show up for their appointments. When you make that effort, you show patients that you’re committed to helping them get the care they need and that you, as a provider, bear some of that responsibility.
Lately, the SMS text message has become an effective way to send appointment reminders, as the vast majority of healthcare consumers use smartphones. However, emails and phone calls can work as well. The key is to develop automated cadences in advance of the appointment. For example, you can send a text or email seven days and three days in advance, then call the patient the day before.
You can also send reminders for special instructions too. For example, maybe a patient needs to fast in advance of their procedure or stop certain medications. Sending a detailed reminder that includes this information is yet another way to potentially improve patient outcomes.
 
6. Educate Through Content
When building out your site content, remember this mantra: patients first; appeasing the Google gods second. Why? Because the former now inherently supports the latter thanks to Google’s E-A-T and YMYL updates. So, how do you publish expert, authoritative, and trustworthy content that helps people make better decisions about their healthcare?
Educate your healthcare consumers by drawing on your own experience and training. We recommend mapping content to specific needs across the patient journey. Let’s take plastic surgery as an example. Early in this journey, patients are likely addressing objections and fears, such as cost, negative outcomes, and even stigma. As a plastic surgery practice, you might consider publishing an eBook or digital guide to help patients make a more informed decision (“Plastic Surgery: Is it the Right Choice for Me?”).
Sticking with the plastic surgery example, you might publish different educational content to address the needs of a patient that’s further along the journey. We’ve seen plastic surgery practices produce short, engaging video clips in which the surgeons themselves walk the patient through a procedure, including preparation, duration, and other post-op details. Testimonials work too.
Regardless of the healthcare space, the key is to become a trusted resource by consistently putting out authoritative information that helps people make better decisions (not just selling your services). If you can build out this quality of content for each stage of the patient journey, you’ll be well on your way to an improved patient experience.
 
7. Consider Deploying a Chatbot
In our recent blog post, How Chatbots Can Improve the Patient Experience, we took a close look at how chatbots are being used in healthcare. There’s no question that chatbots have the potential to make life easier for patients by providing timely communication and information without the need for human intervention. As they say, no one wants to call customer support if they don’t have to.
Chatbots make your life and your patient’s lives easier by providing timely communication and information without the need for human intervention.
That said, poorly constructed chatbot solutions that are rushed to market can have the opposite effect on patient experience. Again, many of the principles we’ve already mentioned in the context of content, websites, and patient journey apply to chatbots. Here are some of the core tenets of a well-designed chatbot:

Capable of understanding natural language queries
Built on “playbooks” mapped to the most common patient queries
Linked to an extensive content database for easy answer retrieval
Free of “dead-ends” (if need be, the chatbot can hand the interaction off to a live agent)
Backed by analytics that help reveal sticking points, inefficient experiences, and content gaps

 
Final Thought: Marketing Needs to Listen to Patients
Yes, healthcare marketers can help improve the patient experience. It’s not just selling, clicks, traffic, and conversions! Indeed, healthcare marketers often have the best tools and tactics for capturing patient insights. In the end, it’s the teams that not only listen to these insights but adapt their patient journeys accordingly that win.
So I’ll leave you with this final imperative: do what you can to learn what your patients care about most. That might mean directly asking for feedback in the form of surveys (CSAT, for example) or reviews. It might mean monitoring digital channels for insights, including Reddit, GMB reviews, Facebook pages, and so on. Finally, you might consider reviewing call lots using conversational analysis tools to connect the dots on where your patient experience could use a boost.
The point is to not only listen but to use that information to guide your marketing efforts. Share that information with your internal teams, including operations, to get aligned around putting patient experience first.
You’ll know it’s working when your patients keep coming back.

                    Marketing in healthcare comes with challenges that marketers in other industries never have to think about. Privacy laws don’t just shape best practices—they define the tools you can use, the platforms you can advertise on, and how you track performance. Every decision is a compliance decision.Table of ContentsWhat’s Changed and Where is the Risk?How HIPAA + Marketing Violations OccurWhy You Need BAAsUsing Non-HIPAA Compliant MarTech in a Compliant MannerCall Tracking & Analytics SolutionsMarketing Analytics & Data VisualizationDemand-Side Platforms (DSPs)Secure & Compliant Website TechnologiesSMS Marketing PlatformsReputation Management ToolsMarketing Automation & Email MarketingCRMsConclusion
Want to run retargeting ads? Not so fast. Trying to determine marketing attribution? You’ll have to get legal’s sign-off before connecting anything to your EMR—if it’s even allowed. Marketing best practices and tools that were once basic are now a regulatory minefield. It’s frustrating, exhausting, and constantly changing.
And yet, you still have goals to hit. New patients to reach. Growth targets to meet. The good news? HIPAA-compliant marketing is possible. But it takes the right strategy, the right tech stack, and an understanding of how to operate within the guardrails without slowing down.
This guide is here to help. We’ll break down what’s changed, what’s risky, and what’s still possible in healthcare marketing today—so you can move forward with confidence.




 
What’s Changed and Where is the Risk?
It’s been just over two years since HIPAA changed the game for healthcare marketers. In December 2022, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) dropped a Bulletin that redefined what qualifies as protected health information (PHI) and how it can (or, more importantly, cannot) be shared—sending shockwaves through the industry. The HHS bulletin stated:
“Regulated entities are not permitted to use tracking technologies in a manner that would result in impermissible disclosures of PHI to tracking technology vendors or any other violations of the HIPAA Rules.”
What is considered a tracking technology? According to the Bulletin, tracking technology refers to a script or code on a website or mobile app used to gather information about user cookies, web beacons or tracking pixels, session replay scripts, and fingerprinting scripts. (A full list can be found ahead).
Following this bulletin, the FTC has accelerated enforcement of the HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. First up, the FTC alleged that GoodRx violated the Health Breach Notification Rule (HBNR) by failing to notify the FTC that it had shared the personally identifiable health information of millions of users with third-party advertisers and others without the user’s authorization. Since then, other healthcare organizations have faced complaints and lawsuits. 
Fast Forward to 2025
On March 18, 2024, the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) updated its guidance on online tracking technologies and HIPAA compliance to provide more clarity to the healthcare community.
The update followed pressure from the American Hospital Association’s appeal to Congress and a subsequent lawsuit challenging the broad implications of the original guidance. While HHS acknowledged the industry’s concerns, the key takeaway is clear: they are not backing down. Instead, these updates reinforce their commitment to enforcing HIPAA compliance in digital marketing.
However, the core message remains the same as the 2022 HHS Bulletin: PHI is heavily regulated, and you cannot pass it along to a tracking technology vendor without following HIPAA Privacy Rules. However, recent updates have clarified several key points that impact how healthcare marketers must handle tracking, analytics, and data sharing.
Here are the three biggest takeaways:
1) Unauthenticated Webpages are Subject to Regulation
It’s well understood that HIPAA applies to authenticated pages—where patients log in to schedule appointments or access medical records. However, a key clarification now states that certain unauthenticated web pages are also regulated under HIPAA.

Pages like hospital visiting hours or general wellness blogs do not contain PHI and are not regulated.
Pages related to health conditions, treatments, or provider searches are regulated if the user is seeking healthcare services.
Even without a login, tracking an IP address or geolocation on these pages can be considered PHI because it suggests an individual’s interest in a specific healthcare condition or service.

Since you cannot distinguish whether a visitor is seeking care (vs. conducting research), all identifying data must be treated as PHI on regulated pages.
2) Older Privacy “Solutions” Do Not Satisfy HIPAA Compliance
Many businesses assumed they could rely on older privacy measures to remain compliant—but the new guidance makes it clear that these are not sufficient.

Cookie consent banners do NOT satisfy HIPAA authorization for tracking PHI. Even if users accept tracking cookies, that does not meet the standard for a HIPAA-compliant patient authorization.
Google Analytics and similar tools still capture PHI, even if they don’t store it—and HIPAA violations occur at the moment of collection, not just at storage.
You cannot rely on past interpretations of “privacy-friendly” tracking—HHS has confirmed that all tracking on regulated pages must fully comply with HIPAA.

3) The Privacy Rule and BAA Cannot Be Evaded
If you are tracking data on any regulated healthcare webpage, you must have:

A signed Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with all tracking vendors
HIPAA-compliant authorization for any PHI disclosures

If your preferred tracking vendor refuses to sign a BAA, you have two options:

Use a Customer Data Platform (CDP) like Freshpaint, which will sign a BAA and ensure all data processing is compliant.
Replace the vendor with a BAA-signing alternative, such as:

Mixpanel for HIPAA-compliant analytics
Invoca, Liine, Call Box, or Patient Prism for call tracking


Implement server-side tracking to control the flow of data and strip PHI before it reaches third-party tools. With server-side tracking, data is routed through your own secure tagging server (e.g., hosted via Stape.io), giving you the ability to anonymize or hash identifiers before passing them to platforms.

Interpreting Regulatory Changes: A Legal & Compliance-Driven Approach
Regulatory changes in healthcare privacy are complex, and their interpretation should be guided by your organization’s legal and compliance teams. Every healthcare organization has a different level of risk tolerance, and determining the right approach to HIPAA and state privacy laws requires internal evaluation and strategic decision-making.
This guide is not legal advice—it is a resource designed to help you develop a privacy-first marketing strategy by compiling the latest industry insights, regulatory updates, and HIPAA-compliant marketing solutions. Ultimately, it is up to your organization to assess compliance risks and define a path forward that aligns with your business objectives and legal obligations.
 
How HIPAA + Marketing Violations Occur
The long and short of it is this: HIPAA violations occur when you combine personal identifying information (i.e., Name, IP Address, Phone Number, Email, Device ID, etc.) with protected health information.
What is “health information” exactly? Well, it comes in two forms: explicit and implied.
What’s an example of ‘explicit’ health information? Think about when a potential patient submits a website form requesting healthcare services. That would be ‘explicit.’ So-called “implied” health information might involve another user simply visiting a specific condition page. It’s “implied” that they are seeking healthcare, but they haven’t taken action and, therefore, haven’t generated “explicit” health information.
It’s at the confluence of those two types of healthcare information—explicit and implied—that your healthcare marketing efforts could possibly result in a HIPAA violation. 
Let’s walk through an example. A user visits your website, providing you with an IP address or device ID. While on your site, that user visits a specific page (say, for oncology treatment), and you use that information to infer that the user has that healthcare condition, then market to them accordingly (using their device ID). That would constitute a HIPAA violation under these new guidelines.
In summary, what happens is that analytics platforms like Google Analytics, HubSpot, etc., are designed to capture a myriad of data. Not all data is bad when viewed in a silo. But when viewed together in the platform, it is possible to tie personal identifying information with implied health information.
What Exactly is PHI?
According to the HHS, PHI is “individually identifiable health information,” including demographic data, that relates to:

the individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition,
the provision of health care to the individual, or
the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual,
and that identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).

18 PHI Identifiers 

Patient names 
Geographical elements
Dates related to the health or identity of individuals 
Telephone numbers
Fax numbers
Email addresses
Social security numbers
Medical record numbers
Health insurance beneficiary numbers
Account numbers
Certificate/license numbers
Vehicle identifiers
Device attributes or serial numbers
Digital identifiers, such as website URLs 
IP addresses
Biometric elements, including finger, retinal, and voiceprints
Photographs of a patient’s face
Other identifying numbers or codes

 
Why You Need BAAs
An important piece of this new puzzle for healthcare marketers is the BAA or Business Associate Agreement. A business associate agreement defines a legal relationship between HIPAA-covered entities, such as doctors and practices, and business associates (i.e., tech tools, software, etc.) that can potentially access PHI during the course of their work for a HIPAA-covered entity. This type of agreement is designed to ensure complete protection of a patient’s PHI. 
How do they make technology and apps HIPAA compliant? Well, a BAA alone doesn’t make a technology HIPAA compliant—it’s one component of a broader compliance strategy. Technology providers must also implement technical, administrative, and physical safeguards, including but not limited to data encryption, access controls, and audit controls.
It’s important to know that getting a BAA in place is not always easy, either. Some marketing technologies and ad platforms will not sign them (E.g., Facebook and Google Ads). Moreover, even if they are willing to sign, they may insist on their own agreement, rejecting your organization’s BAA. This often becomes a contentious issue for compliance teams, and reaching a compromise can become elusive.
As we delve into potential marketing tools, it is crucial to remember that a BAA is not a one-size-fits-all remedy, and a potential tool might not be a solution for your organization. 
 
Using Non-HIPAA Compliant MarTech in a Compliant Manner
Just because a technology isn’t HIPAA compliant doesn’t mean it’s off-limits to you as a healthcare marketer. 
Remember, not every marketing tool captures PHI. To ensure that your solution is not capturing PHI, it’s important to understand what PHI is in the eyes of the HHS (as described above). 
When implementing new technologies, ensure you fully understand how the tech will be used, what information is being captured, and where (and how) it’s being stored and sent. Train your marketing and operational team to understand data management best practices. 
As a counterexample, you never want anyone on your team uploading customer lists to an ad platform like Facebook or Google or an email marketing platform that hasn’t signed a BAA! 
You will need to be especially vigilant with staff that comes to you from other industries, such as retail or CPG. Remember, they’ve been using marketing tech and customer data differently and may need special training to ensure they understand how different the stakes are in healthcare.
 
Customer Database Platforms (CDPs)
What do you do when a marketing technology vendor won’t sign a BAA? You can consider implementing a CDP or Customer Database Platform. 
Implementing a CDP lets you keep your current technology stack, avoiding expensive switching costs. 
CDPs safeguard patient health information and ensure the anonymity of your website users through various mechanisms. 

CDPs employ robust data encryption techniques to secure patient information during transmission and storage. This encryption ensures that the data remains protected even if it is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized individuals. 
CDPs often implement strict access controls, limiting data access to authorized personnel who require it for legitimate purposes. This prevents unauthorized individuals from viewing or manipulating patient health information. 

Additionally, CDPs use techniques like data anonymization or de-identification to remove personally identifiable information from the datasets. By anonymizing the data, CDPs help ensure that patient health information is stripped of identifying details, making it nearly impossible to link the data back to specific individuals. These measures collectively safeguard patient privacy, protect health information, and allow marketers to use other technologies in a HIPAA-compliant manner. With identifying information removed, marketers, for example, can pass information between data sources like Google Analytics and Google Ads. 

When considering a Customer Data Platform (CDP), there are several established options available. Rudderstack and Tealium are two notable platforms that have proven effective across various industries. 
On the other hand, Ours Privacy and Freshpaint are uniquely dedicated to healthcare, operating as a healthcare privacy platform. They specialize in bridging the gap between patient privacy and digital marketing, ensuring that sensitive data is never shared with tools lacking HIPAA compliance. This focus makes these platforms an ideal choice for healthcare-specific digital marketing needs.




 
Server-Side Tracking
Unlike traditional tracking methods (client-side), which send data directly from a user’s browser to third-party platforms like Google Analytics or Meta, server-side tracking routes all data through your own secure server first. This setup allows you to anonymize, filter, or encrypt data before it’s ever shared externally, which reduces the risk of exposing PHI.
Some organizations choose to self-host their server-side infrastructure—often using platforms like Google Cloud or AWS—for greater control over security configurations and data governance. While this approach provides maximum visibility and ownership, it also requires dedicated technical resources to manage and maintain the environment.
 
Server-side Tracking Tools
GTM Server-Side is a privacy-focused extension of Google Tag Manager that lets you route tracking data through a secure tagging server you control, typically hosted in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or a service like Stape.io.
Stape.io provides managed server-side GTM hosting with U.S.-based servers and customizable configurations, making it a practical option for healthcare organizations looking to implement HIPAA-aligned server-side tracking without building infrastructure from scratch.
Freshpaint also functions as a server-side tracking layer, with an important distinction: it handles hosting for you. Freshpaint supports both client-side and server-side connection modes, allowing you to capture events without exposing PHI to non-compliant platforms. Unlike server-side Google Tag Manager, Freshpaint can send data to supported destinations in a HIPAA-compliant manner. 
 
Call Tracking & Analytics Solutions
Call tracking is a vital technology in the healthcare marketing toolkit. It provides insights into where your leads are coming from, what they want, and if they ultimately book an appointment. The most innovative of today’s call-tracking solutions leverage AI to track and analyze phone calls and identify crucial data points, including patient sentiment, conversion barriers, lead quality, and more. With this data in hand, marketers can then identify which campaigns, keywords, and resources are generating calls and form fills, enabling them to allocate spend and optimize strategy more effectively.
While there are a number of options out there, we hear that our clients prefer these call-tracking solutions:

Invoca
Liine
Patient Prism
Callbox

 
Marketing Analytics & Data Visualization
Analytics tools in marketing can provide marketers with easy ways to access and analyze metrics that, in turn, provide insight into which marketing efforts are working and which are not. 
The go-to analytics solution for many marketing teams has long been Google Analytics. While a hugely popular and effective tool, it is not inherently HIPAA-compliant. Google places the onus directly on marketers, stating that users should not pass any data to Google “that Google could recognize as personally identifiable information (PII)” or that could be considered PHI.
Here’s why it’s so difficult for Google Analytics to remain compliant: Say a man in the Cincinnati area is looking for mental health treatment for a particular condition. After googling “treatment for [condition] Cincinnati,” that potential patient clicks on a link to your site on the results page. Google Analytics’ tracking tool will collect your page URL along with the IP address of the potential patient. These two pieces of information put together violate HIPAA regulations because a connection has been made between a piece of PII (the patient’s IP address) and your URL—potentially identifying the patient’s condition.
While a Customer Data Platform (CDP) can solve the problem—more on that below—you can also use other analytics tools. 
When it comes to analytics solutions, we turn to the following, all of which will sign a BAA and offer a solid alternative to Google Analytics 4:

Heap
MixPanel
Amplitude
Google BigQuery
Looker Data Studio

 
Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs)
Demand-side platforms (DSPs) allow healthcare marketers to run programmatic advertising across multiple channels, including display, video, and connected TV (CTV). However, many DSPs do not sign BAAs, making them non-compliant for handling PHI-related audience data.
Most DSPs do not sign BAAs, which makes them risky, if not outright unusable, when handling PHI or condition-related targeting. 
To stay compliant, healthcare advertisers must:

Recommended HIPAA-Compliant DSP: Illumin
Illumin is one of the few DSPs that will sign BAAs, making it a strong choice for healthcare organizations. It allows advertisers to build privacy-first, full-funnel patient acquisition campaigns while ensuring that no PHI is exposed to non-compliant platforms.



Integrates with Meta, enabling seamless cross-channel campaign management
Built for full-funnel patient journeys, from awareness to booked appointments
Leverage propensity scoring and Pathlight reporting to visualize campaign impact

As the only canvas-based trading platform, it allows you to map, manage, and optimize the full patient journey. 
HIPAA-Compatible (with a CPD): Viant
Viant does not sign BAAs directly, but it can still be used in a compliant way when integrated through a CPD. For organizations that have that infrastructure in place, Viant can be a powerful option. Highlights include:

Built around incremental conversions, helping advertisers understand true campaign impact
Supports third-party audience targeting, enabling broader reach
Enables multi-touch attribution across the channels it manages, giving a clearer picture of patient acquisition journeys

 
Secure & Compliant Website Technologies
Websites remain an essential first point of contact for patients, serving as the foundation of most patient acquisition strategies. For many, research into a condition and/or care starts online, and websites can serve as a way to continue research, evaluate providers, and, of course, schedule initial appointments. On the provider side, websites can include important tools for communicating directly with potential patients, including chatbots, forms, and live chat.
Now more than ever, however, healthcare marketers need to ensure that they are using secure and HIPAA-compliant tools with their websites.
 
Website CMS (Content Management Systems)
Chances are, if your site is doing its job, it will be “handling” PHI at some point. Whether patients are filling in forms, engaging in live chats, or just viewing condition web pages, there’s an opportunity to transmit PHI. For this reason, whatever CMS you use must be HIPAA-compliant or offer integrations and plugins to meet security and privacy requirements. 
Here are our recommendations, along with some details on how they address compliance:
WordPress: Making a WordPress site HIPAA-compliant is possible with the right tools and data management strategies. It involves implementing security controls and protocols that meet the requirements defined by the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). The HIPAA Journal recommends that you:

Host the website on a HIPAA-compliant host or with a hosting company willing to sign a BAA.
Ensure that any data uploaded to the website (via form) is through a HIPAA-covered plugin (see below).
Store electronic PHI separately from WordPress and ensure data encryption during transit and at rest.
Train all website users on privacy and security best practices.
Implement two-factor authentication for all website administrators and users.
Use security plugins like WordFence to conduct routine security scans and log CMS user access records. 

Joomla: Like WordPress, Joomla has a two-factor authentication plug-in available that can be used to protect HIPAA-controlled data and keep it secure.
Drupal: Things get a bit more complicated with Drupal, as it’s a platform that requires more sophisticated developers and customization. It can get the job done and achieve HIPAA compliance with add-ons.

Website Forms
Patients today want to take action on websites, and one of the main ways they do that is by filling in forms to book appointments. Often, healthcare groups will use these forms to collect PHI, raising the stakes when it comes to compliance. An open text field in a form asking “why are you contacting us” allows a user to enter PHI and exposes you to risk.
As a precaution, we recommend limiting the information you’re collecting.
FormDr: Built for multi-location practices and offers the ability to direct form submissions to appropriate intake locations or providers.
Formstack: Offers mobile-friendly, HIPAA-compliant forms that include data encryption, user-level permissions, audit logging, and security maintenance.
Logiforms: HIPAA and PCI-certified form solutions include SSL, RSA encryption, and two-factor authentication.
MedForward: Submissions are encrypted in transit and at rest and are served over a protected SSL certificate.
Gravity Forms: Gravity Forms is not compliant in its free form. You will need to use the HIPAA FORMS plugin to ensure that you are HIPAA-compliant.
JotForm: HIPAA-compliant forms are only available with JotForm’s Gold plan.
FormAssembly: HIPAA-compliant forms are only available with Enterprise and Government plans.
 
Chatbots + Live Chat
Patients have questions, and they want them answered as soon as possible. That’s where chatbots and live chat come in, providing healthcare groups and marketers with a way to engage patients when they want help.
What are the best options when it comes to these site tools? We recommend going with Smartbot360 as your chatbot solution. It’s built specifically for healthcare.

If you want live chat grouped with a chatbot solution, we recommend the following:
LiveChat: HIPAA compliance is only available with an Enterprise account.
Freshworks: HIPAA compliance is only available with the standalone version of Freshchat.
TeamSupport: HIPAA compliance is only available through an add-on.


Online Schedulers
Today’s patients want the option of scheduling online; for that reason, many healthcare groups and their marketers turn to online schedulers, which allow patients to initiate the process themselves online. Looking for information is one thing— scheduling an appointment is another that can often capture PHI. 
When it comes to online schedulers, we here at Cardinal love the following:

NexHealth
DaySmart
10to8
CareCloud
Acuity Scheduling

Why is NexHealth our top choice? 
NexHealth passes data back to Google Ads so you can track campaign performance and train the algorithm on the leads that converted into booked appointments. So not only are you giving patients a seamless booking experience, you’re also gaining valuable insights to improve your campaign performance (all in a HIPAA-compliant manner). 
 
SMS Marketing Platforms
Patient no-shows and dropouts are always a concern in healthcare. SMS marketing and communication tools give practices and marketers an easy way to maintain contact with patients and remind patients of upcoming or follow-up appointments.
Here are the SMS solutions we recommend:

Podium
TigerText
QliqSoft
Notifyd

 
Reputation Management Tools
As patients research, they often look into a practice’s reputation online. Reputation management tools can help you stay on top of your online reputation by automating review solicitation, compiling reviews in one place, and allowing you to respond when not-so-great reviews come in.
We like:

Birdeye
Yext
OhMD
MDidentity

 
Marketing Automation & Email Marketing
Ideally, patients and practices have ongoing, long-term relationships. One of the most effective ways to manage patient relationships in the long term is to leverage marketing automation and email marketing tools. You can use these solutions to keep patients up to speed on new services, push out promotions, and engage patients between appointments.
The marketing automation and email marketing tools that we love are:

Paubox
Virtru
Hushmail
LuxSci
ActiveCampaign – Only HIPAA-compliant for Enterprise tier customers.

 
CRMs
CRMs or customer relationship management solutions serve as a database of patient actions and choices, giving you the information you need to improve patient outcomes and increase patient satisfaction.
We recommend the following CRMs to our clients in the healthcare space:

Zoho CRM
Mend
Enquire Solutions
Salesforce – Requires security customizations and add-ons to become HIPAA compliant.
Freshsales – Requires a signed BAA to become HIPAA compliant.

 
Software Integration Tools
Zapier is an online automation tool that connects different applications to automate tasks without coding. Healthcare organizations often use Zapier for transmitting form submission data, email campaigns, data aggregation, and CRM updates, thereby streamlining their marketing workflows and improving efficiency.
However, Zapier is not HIPAA compliant because it does not adhere to the security and privacy standards required for PHI. Without these safeguards, using Zapier to process or transmit PHI poses a risk of non-compliance.
So, what’s a viable alternative? Keragon is a HIPAA-compliant automation platform created exclusively for healthcare, including more than 100+ integrations with EHRs, HIPAA-compliant CRMs, and AI medical tools. This makes Keragon an ideal choice for healthcare organizations looking to automate their processes while strictly adhering to HIPAA standards.
 
Putting it Together: HIPAA-compliant Advertising Ecosystem

Now that you know which technology is HIPAA compliant, it’s time to assemble the right tools in a way that aligns with your business needs. Integrating the proper technology will help you develop more intelligent advertising that reaches the right patients and drives more booked appointments.
Let’s explore the 5 elements of a data-enabled advertising platform that will protect patients’ privacy:
Quality Signals
For effective advertising, you must capture quality signals (site engagement, form submissions, calls, and actual booked appointments) and transfer those signals back to advertising platforms to inform algorithms. HIPAA-compliant solutions that can capture those quality signals include:

Patient Prism – AI-powered call tracker that can report on booked appointments. 
Liine – AI-powered call tracker that can report on booked appointments. 
Mixpanel – Marketing analytics (GA4 alternative) platform captures onsite activity.
Nexhealth – Online booking platform that can capture booked appointment data.

Informed Algorithms
Capturing quality data is just the beginning; it’s equally vital to ensure that this data is transmitted back to your advertising platforms in a fully HIPAA-compliant way.  It’s possible to pass anonymized conversion actions to advertising platforms manually, but Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) automate this process. CPD options include  Tealium, Rudderstack, and Freshpaint, a healthcare privacy platform designed exclusively for healthcare needs.
Holistic 
For a comprehensive view of marketing performance, you need a holistic reporting system that can track all patient activity and normalize it across data points, locations, channels, brands, etc. This can be a tedious, manual process. ETL tools, like Funnel.io, automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) from various sources into a central data warehouse.
Querable Reporting
For efficient dashboard and report creation, it’s essential to have a dataset that is not only easy to query but also flexible and rapid, allowing for swift iteration of versions tailored to the needs of various stakeholders. ETL tools can direct data to platforms like:

Google Big Query for data warehousing
Looker Studio for data visualization 

End-to-end
Having end-to-end measurement enhances your understanding of the patient journey from initial engagement to actual healthcare outcomes and ROI. That means you need an integration with your EHR or PMS, which is something a CPD can help facilitate.




 
Conclusion
Never fear, healthcare marketers; there is a way forward. With the right HIPAA-compliant marketing technologies in place, you can still do your job while protecting the reputation of your providers and ensuring that you are in line with regulations.

                    The COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed the healthcare sector. In the past, healthcare providers and practitioners relied on traditional marketing methods to attract new patients. However, the pandemic has demonstrated that going digital is the way to go if healthcare companies want to remain competitive. Even in the post-pandemic era, it’s clear that marketing teams need to pivot their strategies and go digital, especially when dealing with problems like staffing shortages–the current healthcare marketing trends say it all. Thankfully, the appetite for digital solutions is increasing among healthcare providers. Therefore, you can’t afford to stick with traditional advertising to attract new patients and remain competitive. Below are universal strategies that will help fine-tune your healthcare marketing campaign and take your practice to new heights.Table of ContentsWhat is Healthcare Marketing?1.

What is Healthcare Marketing?
Healthcare marketing is a multifaceted discipline that includes the processes of communicating, creating, and providing healthcare information. For healthcare marketers, the primary goal is to increase awareness of various medical conditions, illnesses, and treatments, establish relationships with potential patients, and guide them through their journey.
Healthcare practitioners and institutions can achieve such feats by demonstrating thought leadership, implementing coherent marketing strategies, promoting patient-first digital experiences, and strengthening brand trust via social proof. With patient-physician discovery and interaction significantly transformed, healthcare marketing has become an invaluable tool of modern healthcare.
 
1. Leverage Local SEO to Attract New Patients in Your Geographical Area
If your practice has a physical location, you have likely relied on conventional methods like referrals and word of mouth to attract new patients. That’s hardly the case anymore since patients are becoming more tech-savvy by the minute and will use digital solutions like search engines for researching health-related issues and providers. Therefore, if you’re one of the many healthcare practices with physical locations, you should enhance your digital footprint with local SEO.
Outlined below are some proven strategies to increase your local SEO presence.
Optimize Google Business Profile
Consider this: Google Search is the most popular website globally, with billions of searches daily. Even more eye-opening is that a staggering 46% of all Google search queries have local intent. Therefore, your practice must show up consistently for these local searches. One of the most straightforward ways to optimize your local SEO is to claim and populate your Google Business Profile listing or GBP.
GBP is a free tool that allows small businesses and healthcare practices to promote their business information via Google Search. On top of claiming your GBP listing, you should optimize it by providing critical information such as:

Practice name
Website URL and appointment links
Directions/map
Business hours
Phone number
Email address
Customer reviews
A short description of your practice
Photos of facility/clinic and staff

Ensure this information is accurate and up-to-date, particularly with your business hours. For instance, if your GBP listing says open and your front desk can’t be reached, that’s a big problem.
By creating a Google Business Profile for your organization, you can effectively fill up your pipeline by capturing high-intent BOF leads in your target areas.
In addition, you may also create FAQs or frequently asked questions about common patient inquiries, including services and treatments and accepted insurance. Ultimately, GBP is a critical local SEO tool, providing potential patients with information to help them convert.
Use Local Citations
According to Brightlocal’s 2023 Local Consumer Review Survey, 98% of consumers used the web to research information about local businesses. As such, local citations and listings can help bolster your local SEO strategy because these are some of the many ways search engines can validate your healthcare practice. Citations make it easy for Google to understand the nature of your service and connect you to your target audience.
Types of Local Citations
There are a few types of local citations that could work for your local clinic or health center:

Structured Citations: A structured citation is when your name, address, and phone number (NAP) are listed on relevant directories such as Yelp, WebMD, Healthgrades, and ZocDoc. These structured directories generally have massive databases of reliable information, so search engines like Google prefer them.
Unstructured Citations: These citations also include essential information about your healthcare business but in a less organized manner. They’re generally found in more traditional websites and apps and aren’t designed as directories or business listings. Good examples of these are local news articles, blog posts, social media, and reviews.

Acquiring structured local citations is simple enough: finding relevant large directories known as “primary data aggregators” and submitting your NAP. Meanwhile, getting unstructured citation opportunities is a more involved process. For example, you can look for the “big fish” in your local area (a prominent local publisher or influencer) for potential collaborations and PR ideas.
Reach Local Leads with Geo-Targeted Pages
Multi-location healthcare groups must create geo-targeted websites and landing pages to not only increase traffic but also convert more local patients. Geo-targeted websites and landing pages are optimized based on the geographical areas you serve. When you have multiple locations, patients will visit the location closest to them. By building geo-optimized websites and landing pages, you’re increasing the probability of local patients finding your practice–plus, you’re offering a more personalized experience to them and increasing their likelihood to convert.
Create geo-targeted websites and landing pages for each of your locations. Ensure each page has accurate and reliable information, including your NAP, URLs, maps, business hours, etc. You may also add custom content for each location page for further personalization, such as clinic tour videos, FAQ videos, patient reviews, facility, and staff photos, etc. Lastly, ensure you provide call-to-actions to help patients convert with actionable steps.
 
2. Provide Patient-First Digital Experiences via Your Website
Any healthcare marketing team should prioritize the ability to provide the best user experiences through its website. Why? Your healthcare website is a core pillar of your marketing efforts and is the first touchpoint for most patients. Thus, your web design and user interface (UX) must be purposeful and offer high-quality digital experiences. Below are some ways to improve your healthcare website’s user experience.
Check Your Site Speed, UX, and Mobile Performance
When more than 80% of users jump ship from a website following a poor experience and close to 40% will outright quit a poorly-designed one, marketers can’t afford to have a non-optimized website. Remember that your website is one of the best ways to make a good first impression among potential patients. Therefore, all messaging and design elements should align with how you want to be perceived by patients.
For starters, your website should implement basic web design practices like readable fonts, easy-to-navigate menus and layouts, high-quality professional images, and prominent call-to-actions (CTAs). In addition, you should also prioritize page speed since it can affect your bounce rates. Use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool to effectively gauge your site’s performance and make proper adjustments.
Lastly, you must ensure your website works correctly on all mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets, etc. Mobile traffic accounts for 56% of global website traffic, so the last thing you want is your website to not display correctly for mobile users. The key is to implement responsive design, which helps your website to display properly across all devices, including desktop and mobile.
Create and Leverage High-Value Content
Content marketing remains king, and it’s not just a buzzword.
Patients and their loved ones will visit your website with health-related concerns and questions. On top of providing a comfortable user experience, your website must have valuable content targeting ideal patient personas. This means high-value content that answers the visitors’ questions and concerns, and they can walk away with real-world value. 
When done right, high-value content will help establish your practice as a thought leader and trustworthy brand within the community. True enough, high-quality content does more than just sell your practice; it builds trust. Through content and overall messaging, demonstrate that you understand the patients’ pain points and are capable of providing solutions to their health concerns. Think of engaging articles, blog posts, video content, and website copy that resonates with your target audience.
Furthermore, providing valuable content gets you on the good side of Google, thanks to the recent Helpful Content Update.

Eliminate Conversion Barriers
If you want people to choose your practice, make sure you make it easy for them by removing potential barriers to conversion. Eliminating unnecessary barriers will provide patients with a more seamless experience. For instance, streamline the process of contacting your business office through AI chatbots, live chat apps, and click-to-call phone numbers.
In addition, you can invest in patient scheduling software such as AthenaONE and DrChrono for a more efficient appointment process. As a result, you are making it easier for patients to book an appointment and decreasing the burden on your staff due to lower phone call volumes.
 
3. Run a Proficient Google Ads Campaign
Google Ads or PPC advertising remains one of the paid digital marketing solutions for growing patient volume. For the uninitiated, PPC puts your practice in front of consumers by placing your ads at the top of the search engine results pages (SERPs). PPC puts you in front of your ideal patient personas and provides opportunities to capture bottom of funnel (BOF) leads–aka people ready to see a healthcare provider.
In the post-pandemic era, healthcare organizations face unprecedented pressure to cut down patient acquisition costs while growing their patient base. However, any marketer will tell you that a healthy balance of both spectrums is a fine line to walk. In other words, success in PPC means you have to do it right. Otherwise, you’ll overspend for glorified traffic volume and clicks with no conversion.
Below are some best practices for a more proficient Google Ads campaign.
Choose a Suitable Account Structure
Campaign segmentation has changed over the years. Modern PPC dictates that there are three spectrums comprising three different approaches depending on the level of control you need.

Segmented: PPC marketers wishing maximum control over their accounts should capitalize on the segmented approach. Segmentation excels in controlling budgets and other business objectives. However, it’s not very effective in increasing performance since segmented accounts restrict algorithm learning and leave little room for improvement in messaging, tracking, and post-click experience.
Consolidated: Meanwhile, consolidated account structures work best for achieving maximum efficiency. In this account structure, your ads will be grouped in a way to maximize the number of impressions, and algorithmic solutions like responsive search ads can deliver better performance. ThinkWithGoogle recommends marketers to consolidate their accounts for better reach and performance.
Hybrid: A hybrid account structure makes the most sense for multi-location healthcare organizations that want to focus or un-focus on specific locations. Your campaign benefits from consolidation with maximized ad impressions and better Smart Bidding performance, along with tighter budget control and more precise targeting with segmentation. Hybrid brings the best of both spectrums.

Develop a Funnel-Based PPC Strategy
A funnel-based PPC strategy aims to align your ads and campaigns with keyword intent along the funnel, i.e., covering each step of the patient journey. As such, you’re sending the right message at the right time to the right audience. Your conversion funnel should look something like this:
Lower Funnel “Product Aware” Leads
These are BOF or “provider aware” healthcare leads. They’ve gone through the prior funnel stages (problem-aware and solution aware) and may be familiar with your clinic or health center via your ads targeting prior funnels. These leads have decided that they need to see a healthcare provider. Direct the algorithm to show ads with high-intent, product-aware keywords at this stage.
Mid-Funnel “Solution Aware” Leads
Many high-intent leads will fall into the mid and upper funnels. Solution aware leads are already looking for solutions because they know they need something but are still determining what type of treatment they should get. Leads in this funnel are prime targets for nurturing and education. Use solution aware keywords that educate patients about your services and treatments.
Upper Funnel “Problem Aware” Leads
Upper funnel leads are people who aren’t ready to become patients yet. This is the research and solution discovery phase, so these are lower-intent leads. This person knows they have a healthcare concern and are asking questions. For the upper funnel, use problem aware keywords like “signs of diabetes in your 40s.”
 
4. Use Social Proof So Patients Advocate for You
As I’ve mentioned earlier, patients are more tech-savvy, which means they rely on the Internet when looking up healthcare providers. This closely ties in with your digital reputation. With that said, 72% of healthcare consumers count on online reviews when evaluating doctors and other medical professionals.
What does this mean for your practice?
This means you should have a solid reputation management strategy and use your social proof to build trust and credibility within your community.
Best Practices for Managing Your Digital Reputation
Social proof may come in different forms, social media profiles, user reviews, and testimonials. For instance, if you have a healthy following on social media, you’ll want to showcase that on your websites and landing pages to build trust and credibility for your brand.
For healthcare practices, the most important social proof is patient reviews. As mentioned, healthcare consumer behaviors have changed, and they no longer rely on referrals, word of mouth, and traditional advertising (e.g., TV, radio, print, etc.) when searching for providers. Instead, they will evaluate providers by reading patient reviews.
To generate patient reviews, the quickest and most reliable way is to encourage patients to leave reviews–and this is where a proper review collection strategy comes into play. You can train your front-facing staff to ask patients for reviews following an appointment. Thankfully, satisfied patients will be more than happy to leave their feedback. Ensure you provide multiple, accessible ways to leave reviews, including short review forms and follow-up emails.
Automate your review solicitation using tools like Birdeye.
Investing in reputation management platforms like Birdeye and Podium is also worth considering. These systems can seamlessly integrate with your CRMs, and help automate the review collection process.
 
5. Develop an Engaging Video Marketing Campaign
When it comes to engagement, video content is hard to beat. As such, consider investing resources in creating video content for your brand. If you haven’t been paying attention, social media is quickly becoming a go-to source for healthcare advice and information, especially for the younger population.
For instance, many healthcare marketers are missing out on TikTok advertising because it targets younger audience groups. However, Gen-Z patients are aging, and many of them can make decisions for their health. TikTok is an excellent platform for building brand awareness because it’s a more user-centric network with a strong sense of community.
TikTok is also an excellent resource for healthcare marketers because you can use the platform to collect patient insights, refine brand messaging, and source content ideas and trending topics. However, TikTok marketing isn’t the right approach for all healthcare practices. For your reference, some specialties with the most engagement on TikTok include mental health, pediatrics, addiction treatment, cosmetic surgery, women’s health, and more.
 
6. Implement a Patient Retention Program
Many organizations focus heavily on patient acquisition in the competitive healthcare landscape, pouring resources into attracting new patients. However, this full-throttle approach often neglects a critical aspect of sustainable growth: patient retention.
With patient churn rates reaching up to 48% in some cases, it’s clear that keeping existing patients engaged is just as crucial as bringing in new ones.
Patient retention is frequently overlooked because healthcare providers assume that quality care alone will keep patients coming back. However, in today’s consumer-driven healthcare market, patients have more choices than ever. They’re looking for excellent medical care and convenient, personalized experiences that make them feel valued.
Implementing a comprehensive patient retention program can significantly impact your practice’s long-term success. Execute an effective retention strategy with these steps:
Harness Patient Feedback
Start by creating a robust feedback collection system that captures insights from multiple touchpoints, including:

Post-appointment satisfaction surveys via email or SMS
In-visit interviews to gather real-time feedback
Social media channels for patient sentiment
Review platforms like Healthgrades and Google Business Profile (GBP)

Take a closer look at your patient feedback–it’s a roadmap to better care. If you notice a pattern, say, lots of grumbles about long wait times, it’s your cue to act. Maybe it’s time to fine-tune your scheduling or rethink your appointment slots. Small changes can make a big difference.
Personalize Patient Interactions
Use the collected data to tailor your communication and services:

Send targeted health tips and reminders based on patient demographics and medical history
Include specific instructions in appointment reminders
Offer secure platforms for direct messaging with healthcare providers
Provide personalized patient portals with easy access to test results and treatment plans

This level of personalization demonstrates that you understand and care about each patient’s individual health needs. For example, a diabetes patient might receive regular blood sugar management tips, while someone with hypertension gets heart-healthy recipe ideas.
Embrace Technology for Convenience
Incorporate user-friendly digital solutions to enhance the patient experience:

Implement online appointment scheduling systems
Send automated SMS appointment reminders
Deploy AI-powered chatbots on your website to handle common queries
Offer telehealth services for remote consultations

These tech solutions improve patient satisfaction and help manage office workflow more efficiently. A dental practice, for instance, might use an AI chatbot to help patients determine whether they need an emergency appointment or can wait for regular office hours.
Track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Measure the effectiveness of your retention efforts by monitoring essential metrics:

Patient Retention Rate (PRR)
Attrition/Churn Rate
Patient Lifetime Value (PLTV)
Time Between Visits

Regularly analyzing these KPIs allows you to identify trends and areas for improvement. For example, if you notice a spike in churn rate among a certain age group, you might develop targeted retention campaigns for that demographic.
Leverage Marketing Automation
Use automation tools to streamline communication and boost patient engagement:

Set up automated email campaigns for health reminders and educational content
Implement ad retargeting to reconnect with patients interested in specific services
Use CRM automation for personalized follow-ups and appointment scheduling

A pediatric practice could use marketing automation to send parents age-appropriate developmental milestone information and vaccination reminders, ensuring children receive timely and appropriate care.
Adopt a Continuous Improvement Model
Implement a cyclical approach to refine your retention strategy. In simple terms:

Plan: Look at how you’re doing and figure out ways to improve your service
Do: Put your ideas into action based on what you’ve learned
Check: See if your changes are working as well as you hoped
Act: Keep doing what works well and fix what doesn’t

Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into this process can automate certain aspects of the improvement cycle, making it more efficient and responsive to patient needs.
Why Prioritize Patient Retention?
By focusing on patient retention alongside acquisition, healthcare organizations can reap numerous benefits:

Increased patient lifetime value: Retained patients typically generate more revenue over time as they continue to use your services and potentially refer others.
Cost-effectiveness: Retaining existing patients is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
Improved patient outcomes: Consistent care from a provider who knows the patient’s history can lead to better health outcomes.
Enhanced reputation: Satisfied, loyal patients are more likely to leave positive reviews and refer friends and family.
Stable revenue: A loyal patient base provides a more predictable revenue stream for better financial planning.
Competitive advantage: Strong patient relationships can set your practice apart from competitors in a crowded healthcare market.

Retaining patients is about finding the right mix of modern technology and genuine human interaction. While data and automation offer helpful insights and improve efficiency, personal care builds lasting connections. Remember, patients appreciate both the convenience of tech and the warmth of a caring team. By combining smart systems with top-notch service, you create an experience that keeps patients coming back.

                            We collaborate with your team to produce a beautiful website that clearly communicates your brand’s unique selling points. Once we’ve squared away the creative details, we create wireframes to determine the information hierarchy. 
Then we mock up homepage design concepts (for both desktop and mobile versions) for your review. From there, we craft an entire design system—patterns of elements that interact consistently to communicate your brand ethos—with design templates for additional pages. The result is a fully-functioning, flawless website that offers users an unbeatable digital experience.

Equipped with the latest stable release of the JQuery JavaScript framework, we make your page more interactive, simple, and user-friendly. JavaScript utilities and frameworks may be chosen to aid in the development of specific visual or data-driven features.

                            Should we take on the revision or creation of new content for your website, we’ll provide a detailed content plan for the pages that will be revised or added to the site. We make sure the content strategy is optimized for search and is crafted specifically for each stage of the patient journey. Content creation will occur in tandem with design and development for maximum efficiency.

That means we’re able to continue providing key insights into page performance even as changes are underway.

                        How long will it take my new website to get up and running?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The short answer is that it really depends. Some clients just need a quick landing page refresh, which can be finished much faster. Others need an entirely new website that supports dozens of locations. This can take several months. Your dedicated project manager will assess your goals and needs, then set expectations about how long it will take to deliver on your requests.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What if I don’t have any developers or marketing staff on my team?

                        Why would I work with a website design agency instead of just hiring freelancers?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The difference between working with a website design agency like Cardinal and working with freelancers is a lot like the difference between being a CEO and being a project manager. 
An agency puts you in the role of the CEO. You set the direction, and we do the heavy lifting for you. We will assess your needs, advise you of what’s possible, outline plans and options to accomplish your goals, see the design and development through to completion, and follow up frequently to ensure everything is performing at optimum levels. You get to play the role of the savvy CEO who invests in a smart solution and reaps a satisfying ROI.
On the other hand, hiring freelancers is more akin to acting as a scrappy, hard-working project manager. You evaluate the needs, do all the research, and decide what needs to be done all by yourself. Then you search for one or two freelancers, hire them, and manage all progress, communications, and problems while they work to get it done. In short, it’s a full-time job for you.
Hiring freelancers is probably cheaper in the beginning, but ultimately the time and frustration it will cost will eat those savings for lunch. Worst of all, in many cases, you won’t get the website you were hoping for. Working with Cardinal–a reputable healthcare website design agency–is the most efficient way to get results.

                    Up until now, I’ve hated agencies. Cardinal has changed my mind—there is at least ONE incredible one out there. Their multi-site design is genius and connects the right audience to the right content at the right time. The work Cardinal has done has been thoughtful, creative, and compelling. It's some of the best I’ve seen in my career.

                                                            With rapid technological advances and growing reliance on the internet, consumers are taking control of their healthcare journey. The one-size-fits-all and physician-voice-driven model has run its course and is undergoing a massive paradigm shift. With healthcare consumerism in full swing, healthcare marketers should prioritize website personalization based on patient-centered participation.

                    According to new research, about 90% of Americans use the internet and their favorite social media platforms when looking for healthcare-related information. As the healthcare market becomes more consumer-driven, patients are becoming more in-tuned to their roles as healthcare consumers, resulting in a significant shift in expectations. In particular, patients expect to be treated as individuals with unique needs and issues. Thus, a one-size-fits-all marketing approach doesn’t foster personalization and, to an extent, patient satisfaction.
True enough, one of the most important innovations in digital marketing is personalization and how it helps patient engagement and provides a more satisfying user experience.
A Dassault Systèmes and CITE Research study shows 83% of modern consumers expect personalized products, services, and experiences. As such, when visitors come to your healthcare website, they hope to see information relevant to their needs, questions, and concerns. They’re used to the “one-click” digital experience (thanks to end-to-end personalization from e-commerce websites like Amazon), where they have instant access to information relevant to them.
Website personalization is one of the best ways to provide user-centric experiences and curate a more dynamic digital experience for patients. This guide includes everything you need about website personalization and how to leverage it to improve patient satisfaction.
 
What is Web Experience Personalization?
Personalized web experiences aren’t exactly a brand-new concept–even in the field of healthcare, which has typically trailed behind other industries in digital adoption. Website personalization encourages providers to present different information to patients based on historical data (i.e., previous interactions). For healthcare providers, it starts with identifying the patient’s health needs and providing outreach based on those insights. Incorporating key patient information, such as lifestyles, behaviors, and preferences, will enable providers to deliver the right message at the right time and to the right audience. Plus, it also allows physicians to choose and select the most effective communication channels.
Personalized web experiences start with data collection. Your marketing team must collect essential information about your ideal patients, including health needs, preferences, interests, and demographics. Information is generally collected by explicitly asking visitors (e.g., requesting to disclose their location) or through various healthcare systems like a CRM (customer relationship management). A CRM is a system that collects guest data which you can turn into patient insights to understand your customer base and create targeted campaigns.
However, personalization isn’t just used for outreach. Personalized marketing can also improve patient outcomes. Because you’re anticipating individual needs and emphasizing relevant healthcare items, personalization helps ensure patients get the treatment they need.
 
What’s the Importance of Website Personalization in Healthcare?
There are various ways website personalization can help improve overall patient satisfaction.
Improve Patient Engagement
Since you have a more holistic picture of your patient’s needs and lifestyle, you can develop a highly targeted digital marketing campaign to deliver personalized experiences. Consumers appreciate personalization because it makes them feel like they’re their person with unique needs and preferences. Tailor-made experiences help patients feel valued and empowered, establishing a connection and brand loyalty. Remember, engagement is a crucial factor in converting more visitors into patients.
Speed and Relevance
A personalized website can improve the patient experience with speed and relevance. With patient insights, you can determine the usual paths visitors usually take and map personalized pathway links to the information they want. As a result, visitors will find the information they want quickly, which may lead to a conversion down the line. If patients cannot find what they’re looking for on your website, they’ll leave swiftly and likely toward your competitors.
Better Patient Outcomes
Personalized marketing isn’t just about messaging. Providers who have collected a wealth of insights regarding patient lifestyle, health requirements, and socioeconomic challenges will be better positioned to forecast their changing needs and wants. For example, personalization will enable healthcare groups to segment patients based on their financial situations, allowing you to craft custom payment plans and send payment reminders via personalized communication channels.
 
Best Practices to Personalize Your Website for Patient Satisfaction
Website personalization is not a straightforward and one-and-done marketing strategy. Below are the best practices to kickstart your personalization strategy:
1. Optimize Your Website’s UX
User experience or UX is a set of practices that focuses on the user’s needs and experience and is often used when designing websites and digital experiences such as patient portals, apps, etc. Simply put, well-designed UX is synonymous with user-friendliness. When potential patients visit your website, they’ll evaluate their experience based on the following factors:

The website’s ability and speed to provide the information they need
Easily accessible website features and functions: physician introductions, video tours, location information, appointment scheduling, etc.
The site and page load speeds (more on this later)
Quality of customer support.

The goal is to provide frictionless and comfortable digital experiences while acknowledging the patient’s needs and values. At a basic level, best practices like easy-to-read fonts, intuitive layout and navigation, professional images, and prominent call-to-actions (CTAs) must be implemented. In addition, when optimizing UX, ensure the digital experience you offer answers the following questions:

Will patients accomplish their goals while on my website?
Do I currently provide the best experience possible? 

If you can’t answer these questions with a resounding “yes,” you’ll likely lose potential new patients to your competing practices.

2. Improve Page Load Speeds
Slow-loading pages are a hallmark characteristic of poor web design and are the antithesis of user satisfaction. In fact, according to a 2017 Google study, an increase in page load speeds from 1 to 3 seconds equals a 32% increase in bounce rate. Google’s Page Speed Insights is one of the best tools to evaluate your website’s page speed–aim for a score greater than 80.
Having said that, below are several optimization steps to improve page speed:

Compress and optimize images
Avoid multimedia clutter
Minimize 404s and redirects
Remote or deactivate unnecessary WordPress plugins
Enable browser and web page caching
Use a content delivery network (CDN)

3. Develop a Mobile-Friendly Website
Did you know that more than 60% of worldwide web traffic comes from mobile devices like smartphones? With that said, mobile technology doesn’t display your healthcare website on a smartphone or tablet the same way it looks on a desktop system. If your healthcare website is not mobile-friendly, it will not display correctly on mobile devices—with limitations like stretched interface, unreadable text, and slow loading speeds.
With a mobile-optimized medical website with responsive design, your website will be displayed correctly regardless of which system it’s being viewed. Mobile-friendliness enables visitors to interact and engage with your brand with zero friction, enhancing patient satisfaction.
4. Provide Dynamic Custom Content
The core pillar of website personalization is sharing relevant content with the target audience. In the consumers’ eyes, if the website content isn’t personalized, it’s irrelevant to them. Custom content solves the problem of relevance and thereby helps boost conversion rates.
Tailor-made content forges an emotional bond with patients. Since the information they see on your website is in tune with their needs, you’re forming a stronger bond with patients. They’ll feel they can trust your practice to solve their unique issues and help them accomplish their healthcare goals. Through this connection, you can build trust and credibility for your brand, which is critical for marketing results.
Outlined below are several strategies to personalize your website with dynamic content:

CTA personalization: CTAs attract people’s attention and compel users to take specific actions like signing up on email lists or downloading an app/patient portal. CTAs present an excellent opportunity to personalize your website and show a clear path to visitors based on where they are on their journey. Personalize your CTAs based on behavioral and psychographic data. An excellent example is customizing CTAs for current and potential new patients.
Relevant dynamic content: Visitors coming to your website have healthcare-related questions and concerns. Thus, your website can be designed to show custom content and present recommendations based on specific criteria, including search terms, geographic location, lead attribution, medical history, etc. As a result, patients will be provided with custom content relevant to their needs, from patient stories to medical services to health screenings.
Content recommendation: This system suggests relevant content to patients who have already engaged in your website in one way or another. You’re offering them more information that they might be interested in. Typically, recommendation sections are labeled “You Might Also Like,” “Suggested Reads,” or “Just for You.” The result? The visitor consumes more relevant content and stays on your website longer.

Our experts at Cardinal Digital Marketing helped IVX Health create webpages with robust content. This allowed their content more easily accessible and digestible for potential patients.
5. Create Patient Personas
With the significant shift towards the consumerization of healthcare, marketers are finding more ways to understand their target audience–leveraging patient personas is one of the best ways to achieve this feat. Patient personas are essentially semi-fictional representations of ideal patients based on your research and data collected from previous visitors.
Patient personas help you determine the type of patients you want–aka people who are more likely to engage with your brand and, hopefully, result in an appointment. As you create these personas, you’ll run into positive and negative personas. Negative personas are low-quality leads with less appealing attributes. They could be visitors looking for treatments or technology you don’t have and one-time visitors.
Detailed patient personas can do wonders for website personalization, and use them for your marketing advantage. With a wealth of consumer data on hand, you’ll be on track to make informed marketing decisions and leverage it for your other marketing pieces, including:

Market segmentation
Content creation
Marketing messages

Invest in creating patient personas so you can personalize many aspects of your marketing efforts.
6. Implement Patient Portals
The accelerating adoption of digital solutions among consumers has proven one thing: patients want to take a more active role in their healthcare journey. On top of being able to research their healthcare options, patients wish to have direct access to their medical records. In the past, people needed in-person visits to get a copy of their documents. With patient portals, consumers can access their medical information at their fingertips.
Benefits of Patient Portals
Patient portals are growing in popularity and are a robust solution for patient-centric experiences. How can patient portals benefit your practice? Here are the ways:

Access to digitized medical records: The best benefit of portals is that it enables patients to access their medical records through a website or app, including test results and upcoming appointments. Plus, they take the load off your staff members because patients have everything they need to know about their health via the portal.
Serving targeted content: Patient portals are excellent places for marketers to offer targeted content to their audience. The portal provides quick access to educational information about their conditions, medications, and procedures in one convenient place. Relevant content through the portal helps with engagement and better patient outcomes.
Appointment scheduling: One of the most time-consuming tasks for your staff is scheduling and following up on appointments. With patient portals, you don’t have to deal with this headache anymore. You can integrate a patient scheduling system within the portal where people can set up appointments and receive reminders.
CRM integration: Patient portals can integrate with your CRM system. When done right, you can automate specific tasks like patient scheduling for a more streamlined operation.


Encourage visitors and patients to use your patient portal by giving it a prominent place within your website. For example, you can add high-profile links to the portal on your home and location pages. The idea is to eliminate as many barriers as possible for a more intuitive user experience.
7. Legal and Ethical Considerations
Before you start your website personalization campaign, remember to mind your campaign’s legal and ethical guidelines.
One of the trickiest parts of healthcare marketing is HIPAA compliance. To illustrate, marketers can only leverage patient information for marketing initiatives under specific circumstances. Furthermore, appropriate security measures are a must to protect sensitive patient information. This is why many physicians and healthcare practitioners are apprehensive about website personalization.
There are also concerns surrounding the collection and usage of consumer data. While many visitors will happily provide their information, asking for too much sensitive information may be seen as a red flag. People are more alert when it comes to their privacy and safety.
Thankfully, partnering with a digital marketing agency will ensure that patient privacy and other legal considerations are correctly approached.
 
Embrace Website Personalization to Satisfy Patients
That wraps up the strategies you can use to personalize your website and healthcare marketing campaign. More than ever, medical providers should embrace the concept of personalized digital experiences to improve patient satisfaction and grow their practice in general. In this hyper-competitive healthcare landscape, personalization allows your brand to stand out from the crowd.

                            A positive digital reputation is critical for your brand’s future growth and success. Negative reviews can sway potential patients towards better-reviewed competitors. We gather intelligence on the digital conversation to identify the perceived strengths and weaknesses of your brand and react quickly to potential crises.

With this information you can capitalize on opportunities and differentiate your practice as a cut above.

                            Our multi-point competitive audit strategy identifies key competitors, gathers data through our network of partners, and provides a statistical analysis of their strengths and weaknesses relative to your brand.
We can answer questions about your top competitors, their business presence (including several locations and reported metrics), which digital channels they’re active in, and what messaging and creative they’re using. We also analyze their digital strengths and weaknesses and compare your brand’s performance.

                            As your brand grows and expands, you must have a complete and thorough view of your potential markets and acquisition targets. Making the right acquisitions and expansions can accelerate your growth, reduce risk, and help your business realize its full potential.
Our market opportunity research strategy helps identify the ideal market conditions for your line of business. We overlay demographic and psychographic data over DMAs to determine priority targets and evaluate the quantity and quality of competitors in those areas. We also use geographic clustering to determine potential practice locations and rank and analyze key acquisition targets and DMAs for expansion.

Our social listening suite can identify the channels and volume of conversation, trends in the conversation’s volume, and the breakdown of positive and negative sentiment. We can also identify key conversation leaders and influencers and determine your share of voice compared to your competitors.

In addition to social listening analysis, we provide review analysis that allows us to identify where reviews are being created, aggregate review scores from multiple sources into a dashboard, and manage/flag negative reviews.
Our analysis will answer questions about the brand’s reviews on key platforms, including volume and overall rating. It will also identify common pain points and positive topics and compare the brand’s ratings with competitors.

                            We export data sets to different endpoints, including Google BigQuery, Tableau/PowerBI, Google Sheets, and other data warehouses, so you can access your data wherever needed. All while integrating all relevant data sources and creating custom dimensions that align with your business needs.

                            Long story short, our growth tactics really work. That’s because we’re performance-driven to the max.

                            From orthopedics to podiatry groups, we help multi-location provider groups crush their growth goals with proven patient generation tactics.

                            One of the key ways we show our support for our team members is through a comprehensive health, dental, and life insurance package. That goes for you and your dependents! Quality, affordable healthcare you can count on when life happens (as it always seems to!).

                            The future might seem far off, sure. Why not pad that 401k to help fund a few trips in retirement? Our 4% company match for employee 401k programs ought to help you do just that.

                            That’s right: if you’re overworking yourself, or putting your paid time off on hold with reckless abandon, we’ll step in to get your vacation going for you. Those waves in Hawaii aren’t going to surf themselves! And with unlimited PTO, you’ll have all the time you need to get your bird on (and fly, duh).

                            So many of our team members have families themselves, or will soon. Which is why we’re so proud to offer 12 weeks of fully paid maternity leave to all the mommas in our Flock. For the poppas, we offer three weeks of fully paid paternity leave.

                With an emphasis on work-life balance during 2020 and the global pandemic, we made security a top priority for our employees. This meant embracing the work-from-home model and making it a seamless part of our daily operations. Turns out, a lot of employees really liked the trust and flexibility of WFH. Productivity and efficiency got even stronger. So we kept it! Now all employees are allowed to work from home 2-3 days a week, with the rest spent in-office.

                When we win, you win. And we REALLY want you to win. Which is why we’re constantly reflecting on how we can better prioritize inclusivity, diversity, visibility, and individual support.
Other highlights include:


An office-less CEO (he sits among the Flock, for better or worse)
Openness to being real about what’s going on in the world. Group-wide discussions about the various social justice movements and how we can support them are common.

                When we say the CEO has an open-door policy, we mean it. Not long ago, Alex asked the agency what they would do with $250k. When we told him we wanted to use it to acquire more healthcare clients, that’s exactly what he spent the money on. When he asked if we’d rather invest in a Creative Project Manager or Creative Director, we got to decide the title and person we hired.

                Not one member of our Flock is just a cog in the wheel. On the contrary: you’ll have a direct role in igniting growth beyond what most businesses think possible for themselves. You’ll be invited to collaborate with other marketing pros to solve tough business challenges, while applying the latest marketing innovations. And you’ll help businesses large and small dominate their industries.

                    Take a look at the space you will be working in. We like to think of our office as an open and collaborative environment — with some fun murals on our walls (yes, we do have Baby Yoda in here). We also have a few private conference rooms you can use when you need to take a client call or have a focus session with your team. If you think this is an environment you would thrive in, take a look at our open positions or talk to one of our Flockers!

                If you enthusiastically said yes to all five of these questions, then we definitely should get to know each other better. At Cardinal, we value hard work, creativity, discipline, and a good sense of humor. In return, we offer a superior work-life balance and a bunch of other awesome stuff that will just blow your mind.

                Cameron Memorial Community Hospital

                
                
                
                    Throughout nearly one hundred years of operation, Cameron MCH has constantly evolved its approach to care. To meet the region’s needs, it’s expanded to eight additional offices and provider locations. As such, the group’s digital marketing needs have also evolved.
The Cardinal team acted as an ongoing partner, helping to revamp and structure the Cameron MCH website, location pages, and Google My Business listings.

                    Healthcare marketers, especially those in behavioral health and addiction treatment, often carry a kind of inherited skepticism toward Meta. It’s understandable. Behavioral health leads are notoriously difficult to qualify, and in addiction treatment, those leads can come at an extraordinary cost. For years, Meta’s lead forms delivered volume, but not the level of intent an access center needs. Most teams have stories about hours spent calling unreachable submissions or people who had no insurance and never intended to engage.
That reputation came from real experience. Meta’s early lead tools were built for ease, not for the level of qualification healthcare requires. But while many organizations pulled back, the platform continued to evolve. New tools made it possible to verify identity, filter for intent, and connect real patient outcomes back into the algorithm.
In this case study, I walk through how we applied those newer capabilities for a multi-state behavioral health and addiction-treatment organization facing familiar challenges: high CPLs, a high share of unqualified submissions, and pressure to improve acquisition efficiency without sacrificing patient fit.
In four months, we reduced cost-per-new-member by 73% while monthly spend doubled. By the end, Meta was generating new members at a cost 28% lower than paid search. Nothing changed about the service line or the audience. The improvement came from rebuilding the funnel and using Meta’s tools in ways that align with the realities of behavioral health patient intent.
 
How Meta evolved as a performance channel
Several developments reshaped what was possible on the platform. SMS verification helped eliminate bot traffic by requiring users to validate their phone numbers before form submission. Conditional questions created new opportunities to ask about insurance coverage, treatment preferences, or patient readiness. CRM integrations through the Conversions API made it possible to pass actual conversion data back into the platform so the algorithm could learn what a high-intent patient looked like.
Together, these improvements turned Meta into a more intelligent acquisition channel. But few healthcare organizations had updated their approach. Most continued running lead campaigns the way they had five years earlier.
The client in this case study had a familiar challenge: high lead volume, low conversion rates, and a sales team overwhelmed by unqualified submissions. They were willing to invest in the channel again, but wanted a more predictable, patient-focused system. This became the starting point for the transformation.
 
A new framework for Meta success
Through repeated testing across behavioral health, physical therapy, vision, and multispecialty groups, Cardinal developed a five-pillar framework that improves both lead quality and patient acquisition efficiency. Each pillar builds on the previous one, creating a step-by-step path from initial creative testing to full-funnel optimization.
Cardinal’s five-pillar framework for improving Meta lead quality and reducing cost-per-new-patient.
Before we began optimizing, we had to understand the root cause of the performance breakdown. The issue wasn’t demand or the service line. It was the structure of the funnel, the lack of qualification signals, and the overwhelming amount of low-intent form submissions.
Healthcare groups looking to strengthen Meta performance can begin with a phased approach:
Pillar 1: Messaging that motivates patients
Before making any technical changes, we focused on what users saw first: the ad creative. Message testing is often undervalued in digital performance programs, particularly in healthcare, where many ads rely on similar templates and language. Yet creative is the mechanism that attracts (or repels) qualified prospects.
Two themes shaped the first round of testing. We compared results-oriented messaging to more supportive, encouraging copy that acknowledged the difficulty of taking the first step toward treatment. Encouragement-focused ads produced a 25% lower cost-per-lead than messages centered on results alone.

A second test incorporated insurance language. The client’s marketing team had shared an important insight: users with insurance coverage converted at a significantly higher rate. When insurance was mentioned directly in the ad, cost-per-lead improved by 11%. That signal became essential later when optimizing the form itself.
These early tests created a foundation for the rest of the work. Once the most effective messages were identified, budgets were shifted to the ads that produced higher-intent submissions.
 
Pillar 2: Fueling the algorithm with stronger signals
Meta’s algorithm improves when fed with high-quality audience signals. Instead of pushing lead forms directly to cold audiences, we built a warm-audience approach grounded in engagement.
Video viewers and in-platform engagers became the first targets for lead campaigns. Site visitor and cross-channel remarketing were introduced selectively and only through HIPAA-compliant methods. This ensured that all audience building followed current healthcare regulations and best practices.
This strategy tripled monthly spend while improving lead quality from 17% to 24% qualified. Once the algorithm recognized the behaviors associated with higher-intent users, it delivered ads to people more likely to convert.
The warm-audience structure also created room to scale. As the client expanded budgets, Meta had a larger pool of relevant users to draw from, helping protect efficiency while enabling continued growth.
 
Pillar 3: Removing spam leads
Although lead quality improved, a significant portion of submissions were still categorized as spam. In March, 57% of unqualified leads were marked as “not a lead/spam.” Users completed the form but provided fake contact information or immediately became unreachable.
To address this, we added conditional questions that asked about service interest, whether the user preferred virtual or in-person treatment, and willingness to receive a callback. These questions filtered out users who were not ready to engage or had no interest in treatment. After implementing conditional logic, spam fell from 57% to 19% of unqualified leads in one month.

SMS verification was added next. This step required users to validate their phone numbers during form submission, effectively eliminating bot traffic. By June, spam was eliminated.
Removing spam created a clearer picture of true intent. It also saved the access center time and helped identify the next barrier to conversion: insurance coverage.
 
Pillar 4: Insurance filtering reshaped the economics
With spam removed, the dominant disqualification reason was lack of insurance coverage. Seventy-two percent of unqualified leads fell into this category. We added a conditional question asking users to confirm their insurance, then tested two variations of the form: one displaying a full list of accepted insurance plans, and the other showing plans available only in the user’s state.
The results surprised everyone. The full-list form produced a higher cost-per-lead, but a far stronger cost-per-new-member. The state-specific version looked efficient on the surface, yet conversion from lead to new member was significantly lower. The full list created clarity and helped users self-select earlier, leading to a higher share of qualified submissions.
Adding insurance filtering reduced the cost-per-new-member by 44% month over month. Once the winning form structure was identified, the lower-performing variant was paused, and the budget was shifted to the version that produced better downstream results.
 
Pillar 5: Optimizing for patient outcomes, not CPL
The final stage of optimization focused on shifting attention away from platform metrics like cost-per-lead and toward business outcomes. When comparing the two insurance form variations, the state-specific version had a much lower CPL. Yet the cost-per-new-member was nearly twice as high as the full-list version. The scheduled rate was also weaker.
This reinforced an important principle for healthcare marketers: CPL is only useful when it correlates with patient acquisition. When it doesn’t, it can obscure the funnel’s true economics. By prioritizing cost-per-new-member and schedule rate, we identified the approach that produced real value for the organization.

With the optimized form in place, results accelerated. Monthly cost-per-new-member dropped 31% in June, 7% in July, 44% in August, and 25% in September. The client doubled its spend while improving efficiency, and Meta became their most consistent source of new members.
 
The final results
Four months after beginning the rebuild, the client achieved a 73% reduction in cost-per-new-member. Spam disappeared. Lead quality improved at each stage of the funnel. The algorithm learned to prioritize behaviors associated with treatment readiness. Most notably, Meta surpassed Google paid search, producing new members at a cost 28% lower than search campaigns.
The client continued running Meta as a core acquisition channel and expanded its use of video, remarketing, and CRM integration. The campaign eventually stabilized to a point where daily optimizations became minimal. Meta evolved into a predictable source of new members rather than a source of frustration.
 
What this means for healthcare marketers
Meta’s evolution is reshaping digital patient acquisition. The platform is no longer defined by high volume and low intent. New tools allow healthcare groups to introduce qualification, verify contact information, and refine audience targeting. When paired with insights from CRM data, Meta becomes capable of identifying and delivering high-intent prospects at scale.
This case study demonstrates what becomes possible when an organization rethinks its approach and invests in rigorous testing. Instead of focusing on lead quantity, the funnel shifted toward patient outcomes. Instead of running campaigns in isolation, creative, audiences, and CRM data worked together. Instead of treating Meta as an awareness channel, the platform became a reliable source of new member growth.
 
A roadmap for your organization
Healthcare groups looking to strengthen Meta performance can begin with a phased approach:
Phase 1: Build the Foundation

Begin with message and creative testing. Identify which themes consistently attract higher-intent users, not just clicks or cheap leads. This often includes testing encouragement-focused copy, value props, and insurance callouts. At the same time, run top-of-funnel video or educational campaigns to create early warm audiences that will later fuel retargeting.
Phase 2: Strengthen Audience Signals

Shift from cold audiences to warm pools, based on engagement signals like video views. And where appropriate, use site visitors and cross-channel remarketing audiences built through HIPAA-compliant methods, such as with a customer data platform (CDP) or server-side tracking. This gives Meta stronger behavioral signals and sets the stage for more efficient lower-funnel performance.

Phase 3: Qualify and Verify

Add the form elements that filter out noise. Include conditional questions aligned to your operational requirements: treatment interest, preferred modality, callback readiness, and insurance, if relevant. Turn on SMS verification to eliminate fake submissions. This combination reduces spam, clarifies true intent, and saves your access center time.
Phase 4: Use CRM Data to Guide Optimization

Look closely at why leads fail to convert. If lack of insurance is the primary issue, add or refine your insurance questions. If location or readiness is the barrier, adjust the form accordingly. Test variations, but evaluate them against cost-per-new-patient rather than CPL. CRM insights should drive both creative and form structure.
Phase 5: Scale and Sustain

Once you see which form experiences and audience combinations produce real patients, scale gradually. Maintain creative diversity, continue feeding warm audiences, and revisit CRM data regularly to ensure alignment with real-world qualification patterns. As Meta accumulates conversion data, performance stabilizes and the system becomes easier to manage.
 
A new chapter for Meta in healthcare
Meta is becoming an essential part of the healthcare acquisition mix. It reaches audiences that search cannot and surfaces patients earlier in their journey. When built thoughtfully, it reduces blended acquisition costs and creates a more efficient path to growth.
For years, Meta was seen as a playground for low-intent leads. That chapter is ending. A smarter funnel reveals what the platform can truly deliver. And based on what we saw in this case study, I expect more healthcare groups will start to rethink how Meta fits into their acquisition mix.

                Advanced Reconstructive Surgery Alliance (ARSA) is an MSO with multiple brands that retain their individual identities. While this approach was valuable for targeting market niches, it added some challenges to their media strategy. 



That’s where we came in. To ensure ARSA met the patient acquisition goals for each brand, we built new accounts for each and segmented campaigns to better reach their audiences. Then, we refined the new keyword strategy and developed optimized landing pages for each brand.
Our efforts resulted in a 294% increase in patient volume—and a 73% decrease in CPA.

How do we do it? We structure each of your Google Ads accounts to maximize efficiency and performance. We’ll consolidate where it makes sense to, then separate campaigns to support the needs of individual brands and locations. Your goals guide our strategy. 
We know how to balance lead volume goals and capacity requirements to build a dependable patient pipeline for steady growth.

                            Citations are a critical ranking factor for local search, but they’re notorious for getting messy as you scale. Inaccuracies and errors can ding your search rankings. We develop efficient systems to ensure accuracy across your listings and Google Business Profile pages.

                            Your growth shouldn’t impact the quality of your rankings. Cardinal believes in creating scalable website structures that set you up for long-term success, no matter how many new markets you enter. A scalable technical framework ensures your MSO’s content gets discovered, crawled, indexed, and ranked at a much faster rate.

                See How We Helped An Expanding ENT & Allergy MSO 

                
                
            

            
            
                When SENTA (Southern Ear, Nose, Throat, and Allergy) Partners approached Cardinal, the MSO was acquiring new allergy & ENT brands at breakneck speeds. Given the speed and scale of this growth, SENTA needed a strategic partner to adapt and scale its paid search strategy for new brands.
We optimized their pre-existing campaigns, then fine-tuned them based on location and brand. We revisited and bolstered their keyword strategy, then set up messaging and UX strategies to match each funnel stage. Finally, we optimized their landing pages and ad copy for precision. 
The results? A 218% increase in conversion rate, with a 40% increase in lead volume. And all that with a 63% CPA reduction.

                MSO Digital Marketing FAQs

                
                
                
                    Here’s what you can expect from our MSO digital marketing services.
                

                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                        Can you develop a website for each brand in the MSO?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We absolutely can. We specialize in creating website ecosystems that support various brand architectures. Whether you have one master brand, several regional brands, or retain all local brand identities–or maybe a mix. We’ve seen it all. 
The process starts with developing a central website structure, including site architecture, page hierarchy, and modules, that can be used as a foundation for each sub-brand. We then customize each sub-brand to match that brand’s visual identity with color, typography, etc. However, we make sure to implement a common look and feel that carries across all brands to ensure a consistent experience for site visitors. This approach makes it easier and faster to spin up new acquisitions in the future and allows you to have more fluidity as your MSO matures.


                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you centralize marketing data across different brands?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Definitely. High-growth MSOs need dashboard reporting that’s privy to their growth. While we build your MSO’s digital ecosystem, we’ll set up reporting capabilities from each brand’s digital assets. This enables us to get a clear snapshot of each brand’s performance, honing in on leads by region, city, and zip code. We also provide dashboards for all your regions, as well as a roll-up of all regions for key stakeholders.
As the trusted growth partner for multi-location healthcare brands, we’re ready to provide dashboards to give you visibility across your platform. Our dashboards emphasize performance measurement and follow information architecture best practices, meaning you’ll see clear results that are easy to digest with just a glance.

A specialist will be assigned to your account for constant supervision – this ensures that your campaign is running efficiently at all times.

This is why we deliver a comprehensive quarterly business review (QBR) on the health of your portfolio.

                            The biggest challenge for high-growth companies is scalability. We understand that quickly adding new locations and services means things get complicated fast and tend to break. Trying to merge multiple local sites into one regional powerhouse is daunting enough from an operational standpoint. Cardinal builds websites with the future state in mind. We’ll help you quickly add new locations as you sign leases or how to fold in local acquisitions quickly and effectively without losing traffic.

                How much more business could you get done if you weren’t constantly vetting new vendors? Assessing the competitive digital landscape and conducting digital due diligence? Reviewing vendors and RFPs? Preparing and negotiating SLAs, contracts, and so on?
            
        

        
        
        
            
                When you find a partner that you can trust, you can say goodbye to those time-consuming tasks. Instead, you come to the table with a strong, differentiated digital marketing team that can hit the ground running. That means you can spend more time securing your next big deal.

                                                            For many years in the past, healthcare was highly physician-focused, where providers could grow their practice by simply being able to provide care–patients simply came. Healthcare is now consumer-driven, and patients are empowered to take control of their journey. This is why healthcare providers need to understand, map, and manage the patient journey.

                    Modern patients are more aware of their roles as healthcare consumers and know they have options in terms of providers and treatments. As such, today’s patients are empowered to take the reins of their healthcare journeys and have expectations about their care experience. Instead of traditional methods of finding providers like referrals and word of mouth, most healthcare journeys now start with a search engine.Table of ContentsWhat is the Patient Journey?What Are The Stages of the Patient Journey?What is Patient Journey Mapping, and How Can It Help Grow Your Practice?How to Map the Patient JourneyFinal Thoughts
In fact, 77% of people use search engines when searching for healthcare providers before picking up the phone. And for patients who booked appointments, digital content and presence are keys to decision-making. Healthcare groups must focus on providing exemplary digital experiences to attract these tech-savvy patients.
As Adrienne Woods, Vice President of Digital Engagement at Hackensack Meridian Health, said during Scaling Up:
“We need to understand our patients—how they want to engage with us and what they expect from their healthcare experience.”
This means healthcare organizations must go beyond simply being available—they need to anticipate patient needs, create seamless digital experiences, and meet patients where they are. To meet and exceed the expectations of modern patients, healthcare organizations must understand the importance of the patient journey. Below, I discuss the definition, importance, the ways in which the patient journey can help you grow your practice.
 
What is the Patient Journey?
The patient journey is the term used to refer to an individual’s experience throughout a care delivery episode. From scheduling their first appointment to receiving treatment for an illness or injury, the journey describes a series of related events that consumers experience within a healthcare system or across providers.
The patient journey is a process that encompasses all parts of the healthcare system–from hospitals to doctors, specialty care, and outpatient treatment.
While it’s tempting to simplify the patient journey as the before, during, and after the care experience, various stages or touchpoints affect the overall journey. And with the renewed focus on the patient experience due to the rapid shift to value-based care and consumerization, understanding the patient became essential for providers.
Every healthcare system should encourage patient engagement, but not every marketer knows that the path to engagement can change depending on the patient’s healthcare needs, motivations, and challenges. Although patient engagement happens during a single encounter or touchpoint, it doesn’t mean you should only focus your engagement efforts on that encounter alone.
Instead, healthcare groups should develop engagement strategies that cover every step of the healthcare journey. This means having a sound digital marketing plan covering everything from early education and awareness stages to physician interaction and post-hospitalization care.

 
What Are The Stages of the Patient Journey?
Before you can map the patient journey, you must know about its many stages, including:
Before Symptoms: Building Awareness and Trust
Before a patient even recognizes a need for care, their relationship with your brand begins. This early stage isn’t about symptoms; it’s about establishing trust and becoming a resource people rely on when the time comes. In competitive markets, especially those involving high-acuity care, creating strong brand recognition and familiarity lays the foundation for future engagement.
Establishing Connection Without Immediate Needs
Consider major life events like pregnancy and childbirth. Long before a woman plans to have a baby, providers and healthcare systems that provide resources, support, and educational content can become the go-to choice. Whether it is through online prenatal classes, nutritional advice, or parenting guides, the goal is to build an early and lasting connection.
Similarly, high-stakes specialties like oncology and cardiology attract patients seeking the very best care. Patients often turn to health systems they already know and trust. Proactively positioning your organization as an authority in these areas through patient stories, expert-led seminars, or health advocacy initiatives can make all the difference when these patients start their search.
Educating the Unaware
Another critical aspect of this stage is reaching individuals who don’t yet realize they have a problem or that their symptoms can be treated. This is where awareness campaigns and consumer education play pivotal roles. By addressing overlooked issues like mental health conditions (ADHD, anxiety, depression) or chronic pain, your practice can encourage patients to seek care sooner.
For example, an individual struggling with persistent joint pain might not realize physical therapy could offer relief. Or someone scrolling through social media might come across mental health content that resonates with their experience, prompting them to take action. Sharing accessible, relevant, and engaging information positions your brand as both approachable and knowledgeable.
At this stage, the aim is to deliver value through education and visibility. Whether it is blog posts about overlooked health topics, interactive social media campaigns, or community outreach, your organization can establish itself as a trusted partner in people’s healthcare journeys long before they schedule their first appointment.
Stage 1: Awareness
Awareness is the first step in the patient’s process of seeking care. At this stage, individuals begin to recognize symptoms or conditions and start researching to understand their issue and possible options for care. They are focused on self-education rather than provider selection.
Patients in this phase typically explore the following resources:

Online searches (e.g., Google, health blogs, forums)
Social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok)
Reddit and other digital communities

This stage is a critical opportunity to connect with potential patients by providing high-quality, educational, and SEO-friendly content that addresses their questions and concerns. Optimizing your digital presence ensures your practice becomes a trusted source of information early in their search.
Your practice must have a robust online presence to reach patients in the awareness stage. This is where high-quality, valuable, and SEO-friendly content will come in handy for engaging potential patients. In addition, ensure you have optimized your Google Business Profile or GBP listing, as it plays a crucial role in patients choosing your practice. In particular, ensure your online reputation is on point because 94% of patients use online reviews when deciding on healthcare providers.
Stage 2: Consideration
At this stage, the patient analyzes their options and decides if their healthcare fits their current needs. Some of the primary factors patients take into consideration when choosing healthcare providers include:

Referrals and recommendations
Location
Accepted insurance, coverage, and perks
Accessibility
Patient reviews and testimonials

Patients will likely go to your website and/or social media channels for the consideration phase. One of the main challenges that patients face at this stage is the inability or difficulty to reach or interact with the provider. If that happens with your brand, there’s a good chance they’ll go to your competition instead.
At this point, crafting patient personas will help you determine the preferred method of communication for your ideal audience. Email marketing, targeted ad campaigns, and AI chatbots are excellent strategies for making it easy for patients to choose your brand.
Stage 3: Acquisition
At the acquisition stage, the patient has decided to set an appointment with your healthcare facility. This stage involves direct patient contact, where individuals will interact with your practice via phone calls, patient portals, social media accounts, emails, and SMS.
The acquisition stage typically involves the patient’s first appointment with your clinic or health center, aka a preliminary check-up. This interaction can be an in-person visit or a telehealth consultation which took off during and after the pandemic.
In the acquisition, some challenges that patients may face include:

Unable to quickly find appointment links or booking portals
Limited communication surrounding their appointment
Lengthy wait times result in poor patient satisfaction
Dealing with extensive paperwork before meeting a healthcare practitioner

At this stage, healthcare providers who want to facilitate patient acquisition should consider digital solutions like patient scheduling software such as NexHealth and Solutionreach. These programs can provide benefits like automated appointment bookings and minimizing the chance of no-shows.
Stage 4: Care Delivery
The care delivery stage is where your healthcare team shines–basically, where medical care is provided to patients. This journey stage is where the bulk of traditional patient satisfaction is evaluated. This step includes the standard care provisions, including medical consultations, regular check-ups, management and treatment, payment, and registration and discharge.
After choosing your practice, the patient will shift their focus from your online presence and reputation to quality of care. At this point, your main challenges are administering appropriate medicine and treatment and living up to the patient’s expectations. As such, the quality of your service will be evaluated. In general, patients will base their opinion and feedback on personal experience.
At this stage, there are various tools you can use to ensure the highest patient satisfaction, such as:

A billing or patient management software like DrChrono and CureMD, for example.
A customer relationship management (CRM) platform for managing patient relationships and unifying data.
A review solicitation or feedback collection software like Birdeye and Podium

Stage 5: Ongoing Care and Patient Loyalty
In any healthcare setting, attracting new patients is more resource-intensive than retaining current ones. When it’s more crucial than ever to optimize marketing spend (especially in the post-pandemic era), healthcare organizations should also focus on fostering loyal patient relationships. Below are some of the most common strategies to increase patient retention:

Improved communication: Ensure your care team correctly relays information and compassionately resolves concerns.
Interactions during in-patient visits: According to a recent Medscape study, most doctors, on average, spend 13-16 minutes of face-to-face engagement. You can differentiate your practice by going above and beyond by interacting with patients between visits. Short phone calls and personalized healthcare tips can go a long way in retaining patients.
Streamline the appointment process: Use digital solutions like patient portals and mobile apps to streamline the appointment process. Automated SMS and appointment reminders can also reduce no-shows.
Manage your online reputation: Your digital reputation doesn’t just affect patient acquisition but retention as well. Be proactive with monitoring conversations about your practice. Thank all patients for their feedback, and reply to negative feedback or complaints with compassion.
Excellent bedside manners: Treating patients compassionately and with respect will establish strong physician-patient relationships. With every appointment, you can make a positive impression among your current patients and help develop loyalty–soon, they’ll also become brand advocates.

Always keep an eye on your patients’ aftercare and track all your interactions with them. This enables you to provide personalized experiences, which lead to better patient outcomes and higher satisfaction.
 
What is Patient Journey Mapping, and How Can It Help Grow Your Practice?
Patient journey mapping is a method healthcare leaders use to understand how patients interact with their healthcare system or practice at every stage. It provides a comprehensive view of patient experiences, allowing providers to identify opportunities to enhance engagement and satisfaction through strategic outreach.
The stages and touchpoints listed above serve as examples, but every patient journey is unique. Different types of care and providers create varied paths that require tailored approaches. Conducting your own research and mapping your patients’ journeys is essential to identify how to effectively engage with your audience. This process helps uncover the specific needs and preferences of your patient base, empowering your organization to deliver better care and build lasting relationships.

Benefits of Patient Journey Mapping
Mapping the patient journey is challenging, but the benefits are more than worth the effort. Here are some key benefits of mapping the patient journey.
Personalized Patient Experiences
With physician-focused healthcare of the past, you can get away with providing one-size-fits-all care experiences for patients. After all, you’ll have a consistent patient pipeline as long as you provide care. That’s not the case anymore with today’s healthcare that shifted toward consumer-driven and value-based care.
Patients are empowered to control their healthcare journey by arming themselves with information and researching their options. In fact, a recent survey said 72% of patients want healthcare explicitly tailored to their medical needs. Therefore, at the core of the patient engagement playbook is personalized experiences. With customized patient experiences, you can:

Provide flexible care
Improve patient-physician communication
Provide omnichannel options
Engage patients in various touchpoints
Assess and evolve your services

Patient journey mapping enables your organization to understand your patient’s needs, preferences, and circumstances–which is vital for a personalized care experience.
Improved Communication
Once again, your main goal in mapping the patient journey is to lift the veil around the authentic experiences of your patients–including every touchpoint, interaction, and pain point. This feat is achieved through intensive data collection and qualitative research, enabling individuals to express their thoughts and feelings. You can count on improved and more effective communication once you have a holistic picture of the true patient experience.
As you might know, effective communication relies on a positive provider-patient relationship. Since you clearly oversee the patient experience in each stage of the journey, your team can identify the gaps and opportunities to improve communication. For example, mapping the patient journey lets you specify the communication pros and cons. As such, providers may reduce the use of technical terms or medical jargon to help patients better understand the circumstances around their health.
Identify Ways to Identify Aftercare
Journey maps will also allow you to identify ways to support the patients after the treatment concludes, during recovery, and ongoing care/maintenance. For instance, patients with medical conditions or who have undergone major surgery often must comply with a broad routine of medications, behavioral changes, and adaptations to a new lifestyle.
With patient journey mapping, you can find out how patients manage and deal with their day-to-day after treatment which may spark innovations in products and services that may lead to better health outcomes. Improving the quality of your aftercare services can impact patient retention and build a more positive reputation within your communities.
Empowering Patients Through Enhanced Processes
One of the most significant advantages of patient journey mapping is the ability to turn healthcare into a more collaborative experience. By improving digital tools like patient portals, websites, and mobile apps, healthcare providers can give patients more control over their care. Simplifying workflows allows patients to book appointments, access test results, and receive updates without unnecessary delays or confusion. This not only streamlines operations but also boosts patient satisfaction and trust in their healthcare provider.
Increasing Efficiency for Healthcare Teams
Patient journey mapping isn’t just about patients; it’s also a critical tool for empowering healthcare staff. By optimizing internal workflows and introducing automation, teams can manage protocols and schedules more effectively. For instance, streamlining task assignments or automating appointment reminders can free up staff to focus on patient care. Additionally, aligning actual service delivery with what patients expect reduces frustration for both parties, creating a more harmonious healthcare environment.
Digital transformation is reshaping the healthcare landscape, profoundly impacting each stage of the patient journey. By integrating advanced technologies, healthcare providers can enhance patient experiences, improve outcomes, and streamline operations. This section explores the multifaceted role of digital transformation in the patient journey, highlighting key areas of impact.
 
How to Map the Patient Journey
Mapping the patient journey requires detailed research and thoughtful analysis. As Jean Zhang, Senior Creative Director at Cardinal Digital Marketing, explains:
“We need to critically assess user flows, identify the highest-value conversion points, and prioritize them. Conducting a path analysis audit helps us step into the patient’s shoes, experience the website as they do, and ensure the journey aligns with key conversion goals.”
By focusing on key steps in the journey, you can create a seamless and empathetic experience for your patients. Incorporating insights from industry leaders, here are essential steps to guide your process:
1. Establish Patient Personas
To effectively map the journey, start by identifying and understanding your patient base. Ask critical questions like:

What challenges or pain points do they face when seeking care?
What steps do they take to find care? 
Who do they trust, and where do they go for information?
How do they prefer to engage with healthcare providers?

An in-depth understanding of your patients will allow you to craft the best possible patient experience. To achieve this, you need a robust data collection system that enables you to analyze and predict patient needs. This system forms the backbone of journey mapping, empowering your practice to identify trends, refine personas, and deliver personalized care.
“When we build out journey maps, this essentially allows us to follow the journey of that specific persona through these different stages. What I like to do there is not only to state the action, but to then think through what is their actual emotion during each of those stages.”
—Jean Zhang, Senior Creative Director, Cardinal Digital Marketing
2. Track and Monitor Patient Activity
Omnichannel listening provides a comprehensive view of how patients interact with your brand. This approach helps you understand the patient lifecycle and identify areas for improvement. Tracking their actions and perspectives allows you to step into their shoes and address potential gaps.
Understand the Moments of Truth
Every interaction with your brand is an opportunity to build trust and move patients closer to resolving their concerns. Known as “moments of truth,” these critical touchpoints can significantly shape their perception. Google’s concept of the Zero Moment of Truth (ZMOT) emphasizes how patients research symptoms, conditions, and providers online before making decisions. Positive interactions during these moments set your brand apart.

3. Leverage Insights and Strategies
Incorporate these actionable tips to refine your mapping process:

Understand Emotional Stages: Identify meaningful touchpoints by focusing on the emotional stages patients experience at each step. This ensures your messaging is timely and relevant.
Demonstrate Value: Use testimonials, outcomes, and ratings to show the impact of your services rather than simply stating it.
Highlight Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Tailor your USPs to resonate with patients’ needs and emotions, especially during the research phase.
Test and Iterate: Experiment with different value propositions in campaigns to determine what resonates best and refine your strategies accordingly.
Engage Stakeholders: Collaborate with clinic owners and managers to uncover insights about patient pain points and retention challenges.

4. Create a Comprehensive Digital Strategy
When developing a website or campaign, consider the unique needs of all patient personas. Ensure the experience supports them at every stage, from initial diagnosis to aftercare. By leveraging user research and a robust data collection system, you can craft targeted, empathetic, and effective digital experiences that enhance patient satisfaction and loyalty.
By combining these steps with continual research and iteration, your practice can optimize patient experiences, leading to stronger connections and better outcomes.
 
Final Thoughts
As healthcare becomes more consumer-driven, fostering patient engagement isn’t just a best practice anymore but an absolutely essential initiative. Modern healthcare consumers want to be engaged, and mapping their journey will let you engage patients throughout the entire continuum of care. By mapping the patient journey, you’re transforming the patient’s healthcare into a more proactive experience.

                            We help behavioral health providers fill appointment books while ensuring resources are allocated efficiently. Underutilized facilities get more clients, and no ad spend is wasted on fully booked providers, keeping your system running at capacity.

We provide data-driven digital strategies to help retain patients, increase session completion rates, and build long-term trust.

                            In behavioral health, protecting privacy isn’t optional—it’s essential. We help you implement compliant martech solutions and craft privacy-first marketing strategies so you can focus on improving lives with confidence.

                            Despite progress, stigma around behavioral health and addiction creates barriers to outreach and engagement. We help break down those barriers with compassionate, effective marketing strategies that build trust and encourage clients to seek care.

                        Do I need a brand-new website for marketing my mental health brand?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No. If your mental health center’s website is on WordPress, we can continue marketing it. In our experience, WordPress is the ideal content management system (CMS) for healthcare websites because it’s a simple-to-manage platform and is easily customizable to meet the needs of every individual practice. If your website is not on WordPress, we can help with the migration from any platform.
What if you’re not satisfied with the current state of your mental health facility website? According to Stanford’s web credibility research, 75% of consumers judge a business based on its website design. Unfortunately, a poorly designed website will turn away potential patients that may need your mental health services. In this case, Cardinal will also be more than happy to assist.
Our web design team will help you develop a website that doesn’t only look and function well but is also optimized to attract and convert potential patients into paying customers.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How long does it take to see the fruits of your marketing efforts?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The only reasonable answer to this question is: it depends!
Digital marketing takes time, and great digital marketing, with measurable results, takes even longer. Even so, Cardinal sets performance-based goals for all of our clients. We’re huge advocates of transparency, so you’re always included every step of the way in your digital marketing plan–you’ll always know what we’re doing and the expected impact.
For actual time frames, it depends on the services you require. For instance, PPC Management typically yields results within the first three months. On the other hand, a full-scale SEO strategy may take up to six months, although we can fix issues like duplicate content and 404 error pages almost immediately.
Remember that digital marketing is not an overnight process, and anyone who claims it is should be watched.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you take care of all my mental health facility’s marketing?
                                            
                    
                        
                            If you want us to, we absolutely can.
Cardinal is a full-service digital marketing agency that offers a wide range of services. Some of our most popular services include SEO, PPC Management, Facebook Ads, Web Design, Reputation Management, and Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)–just about everything you’ll need to achieve scalable growth for your mental health group. 
Even if you don’t have an in-house marketing team, it’s not a problem. Our clients come from all levels of marketing maturity; we can make it work whether you’re an established brand or a growing new organization. We’ll ensure your marketing journey is off to a strong start and help you get where you need to be.

                        Can you help scale my PPC campaign to create a reliable source of behavioral health admissions?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Of course! The mental health space is a very competitive industry, which brings common challenges to media management, like complex keyword targeting, high acquisition costs, and low-quality leads. 
However, Cardinal has helped many mental health facilities scale their paid search campaigns with great success. Our PPC experts are skilled at devising strategies that will generate high-quality leads, increase admissions, and reduce cost per acquisition (CPA). 
In one of our previous campaigns, we created a high-impact PPC campaign by optimizing account structure (e.g., making use of Google’s smart bidding feature) and refining the ad messaging (e.g., relaying insurance coverage information within the ads). Our PPC management strategies are defined by scalable growth, more qualified leads, and maximum efficiency.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                         My mental health website gets plenty of traffic, but admission numbers are stagnant. How can you help?
                                            
                    
                        
                            It sounds like a mental health website isn’t optimized for conversions.
Most marketing teams will focus on driving more traffic toward websites, but we know that’s only half the battle. Cardinal is one of the nation’s top agencies in Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO). Think of it as a strategy to make your website work smarter rather than harder by eliminating conversion barriers. A better user experience allows you to capitalize on the traffic you’re already getting.
There are numerous ways to optimize your mental health website’s conversion rates and generate more qualified leads. For example, we can engage more potential admits via targeted messaging and creatives that address their pain points. As a result, your website will attract high-quality visitors who are more likely to benefit from your services.

                            There are several answers to this question. For organizations looking to drive traffic, clicks, leads, MQLs, or other business metrics in a visible, repeatable way, investing in a Facebook advertising strategy that works is well worth the money. It all comes down to how valuable that traffic or that lead is to your business.
Also: consider that Facebook has over a billion users. You’ll find almost any customer segment on Facebook. And with Facebook Ad platform hyper-targeting tools, you can zero into highly customized marketing segments down to the neighborhood level. The costs for advertising on Facebook are comparable to Google Ads, but much more customizable for just about any goal, audience, or budget.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What does a Facebook marketing agency do?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The real question is: what don’t we do? A Facebook marketing agency essentially makes sure your Facebook ads reach prospective customers and drive real results to your business. We start by creating a custom assessment of your goals, your target audience(s), your location needs, and your messaging. We’ll lay out a plan for the Facebook audience, ads, and spend to start with. Once the plan’s in motion, we monitor your Facebook ad performance as we go, making small tweaks here and major changes there (with your approval.) Oh: and we don’t stop fine-tuning to make your ads function flawlessly, even after they’ve brought in the revenue you were after. If that all sounds like a win, that’s because it is!
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How do you target ads with increasing privacy restrictions?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Reaching the right audience is becoming more difficult on social platforms. Recent updates to iOS effectively barred apps from tracking users across the web, severely curbing data access critical to advertising tools. Android plans to do the same in the next few years. Despite these challenges, we’re able to effectively reach your audience by leveraging strong ad creative, display advertising solutions (like StackAdapt), and retargeting strategies that re-engage qualified prospects.


                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Who makes the content for Facebook ads?

Track and Monitor the CampaignElevate Your Healthcare SEO Marketing Today
Healthcare SEO aims to drive organic traffic to your medical website and bolster your online presence by increasing your rankings on the search engine results page (SERP). When 75% of users don’t scroll past the first page, you know you can’t afford to make a first-page appearance. After all, if your practice is not on the first page, your competitors will.
Healthcare SEO involves a long list of creative, technical, and scalable strategies, such as keyword research, content marketing, on- and off-page optimization, etc. It’s a long and ongoing process, but the rewards of a fully-realized healthcare SEO campaign, like igniting growth and generating new patients, are worth the effort.
Below we have outlined the best practices to leverage healthcare SEO, grow your practice, and generate more patient leads.
 
1. Conduct Keyword Research
An effective SEO strategy starts with keyword research, allowing you to identify and target relevant keywords for your campaign. This process helps you determine the keywords and phrases that patients use when searching for medical services or specialties. Using the right keywords can help improve your search rankings for those terms.
To find the most relevant keywords for your practice, you can:
Research your target audience
At Cardinal, we use patient personas to guide our marketing efforts, including SEO. A patient persona or profile is a detailed, semi-fictional representation of your target audience. You can build these personas by analyzing critical demographics like age, gender, income, interests, hobbies, psychographics, etc.
Researching your target audience also lets you determine what their primary and secondary healthcare goals are, as well as their pain points and frustrations. Patient personas will help you identify the keywords patients use when looking up health information and use them for your SEO campaign.
Analyze the competition
Another crucial keyword strategy is competitor analysis. Research the keywords used by competitors in search engines like Google. Start by doing a simple Google Search of your target keywords and evaluate the highest-ranking websites based on the results. Alternatively, you may use Semrush’s Organic Research tool to identify your top competitors.
Use keyword research tools
Thankfully, there’s no shortage of free and paid keyword research tools to help you identify top keywords within your practice or sector. These keyword research tools will help you get started:

Ubersuggest
Ahrefs Keyword Explorer
Google Keyword Planner
SEMRush

Once you have your list of target keywords, incorporate them into your site content and metadata (e.g., title tags, meta descriptions), but keep it organic and natural.

2. Create High-Quality Patient-Centric Content
Content marketing enables healthcare brands to connect and engage patients through high-quality, relevant, and valuable content. For better or worse, Google has become a de-facto doctor’s office with over a billion health-related searches every day. This puts medical organizations in a strategic position to provide helpful and actionable advice through content marketing. Healthcare content marketing offers the following key benefits:

Build trust and credibility for your brand by showcasing your knowledge and expertise.
Minimize patient anxiety with helpful content that answers their questions and concerns and shows them exactly what to expect.
Differentiate your practice from the competition.

Most importantly, producing patient-centric content aligns with the recent Google Helpful Content Update, which favors websites that deliver actual, valuable content to readers instead of generic content optimized for the algorithm.
Your success in content marketing hinges on understanding your audience, along with their healthcare needs, motivations, and challenges (again, patient personas). Use the target keywords you researched, and focus on quality over quantity. Consistently producing high-quality content sends a strong signal to Google that your website is a reliable and trustworthy resource, increasing your search rankings.
Google has stricter content guidelines for healthcare, so make sure your content library is refreshed regularly and updated, accurate, and relevant.

3. Develop a User-Friendly Website
Visitors coming to your website want to be engaged, but you’ll have to make it easy for them by providing comfortable digital experiences. You could be ranking high for your top keywords, but if your website fails to be user-friendly, you’ll have a hard time generating leads or revenue from the traffic. In this case, ensure your organization invests in patient-centric web design that prioritizes the user experience.
Investing in patient-centric web design is worth it because every dollar nets an ROI of 9,900%. Otherwise, your website’s bounce rates will skyrocket since nine out of 10 patients will abandon a website following a terrible user experience. Meanwhile, a patient-centered healthcare website will engage visitors and provide them with a satisfying experience, thus, increasing their chances of conversion.
To provide the best user experiences, you need to get the following best practices right:

Make your healthcare website easy to use: Provide comfortable user experiences with easy-to-navigate layouts and menus, legible and eye-pleasing fonts, professional quality images, and prominent call-to-actions (CTAs).
Key content should be discoverable: People coming to your website will have questions and concerns about their health and need answers. Therefore, ensure your website contains valuable information about services, treatment programs, accepted insurance, etc. Moreover, key content should be easily discoverable and not hidden behind poorly-designed menus and confusing link trees. A good SEO technique that promotes good site architecture is called “siloing,” where you group, isolate, and interlink content based on the topic.
Optimize your medical website for speed: Slow-loading web pages are a surefire recipe for higher bounce rates. Use Google’s PageSpeed Insights tool to audit the speed of your web pages. Then, use techniques like image compression, minimal plug-in use, enable browser caching, and use of a content delivery network (CDN).
Prioritize mobile-friendliness: More than half of all web traffic comes from mobile devices, so a mobile-friendly website is necessary. Implement responsive web design so your healthcare website is displayed correctly on desktop and mobile devices.

 
4. Optimize Technical SEO
Technical SEO refers to optimizing various technical aspects of a website to improve its organic search visibility. Google likes it when you make it easy to crawl and index your healthcare website and enhance its relevance and quality for specific search terms–which is what the following technical SEO best practices can do:

Title tags: These are HTML elements within your website’s back indicating the titles of your web pages. Title tags appear on SERP as clickable headlines. Use title tags that accurately describe what the page is all about and use relevant keywords to enable search engines to understand its content.



Description tags: These tags appear below the title tags and summarize the web page’s content. Use primary and secondary keywords in the meta description, keep it between 155-160 characters (including spaces), and include a CTA.
Schema markup: A schema markup is a code you can include in your website’s HTML to help Google better understand your website’s content. Basically, it allows Google to crawl your website better and display your site’s content as rich results.
Outbound and internal links: Outbound hyperlinks connect to an external website, generally for citing claims, statistics, facts, etc. Only link to credible, high-authority websites. Meanwhile, internal links connect to pages somewhere on your website, helping search engines (and patients) discover more helpful content and understand your site’s structure.
Alt tags for images: Google can’t read images but can read text. Alt tags describe the images you use on your website and help Google achieve context and improve indexing. Use descriptive alt tags for all your images.
Sitemaps: An XML site is a file that lists all your site’s web pages that encourage Google to crawl all the URLs. Sitemaps help search engines understand your website’s architecture and are highly recommended if you have a large website with frequently changing URLs. In addition, providing a dedicated Sitemap page is not only vital for SEO but also improves user experience.

Technical SEO provides your website with “good bones” and lays a solid foundation for a successful SEO campaign.
 
5. Optimize for Local SEO
Despite brand consolidation and private equity acquisition trends, healthcare, at its heart, is a local service. Physicians and providers rely on attracting new patients within their geographical area, while patients prefer to work with nearby practitioners. As such, any healthcare business must optimize for local SEO.
Local SEO refers to the process of optimizing your medical website for local search queries and location-based searches. Local SEO is especially vital for practices with physical locations and multi-location companies. “Near me” searches for health-related services have more than doubled over the years, so when a patient searches for “physical therapy near me,” you’ll want your outpatient website to appear in the search results.
Local SEO can get it done for you, but you’ll have to keep in mind the following best practices:
Claim citations and listings
Citations, listings, and directories are web-based references to your practice that, at a bare minimum, include your practice’s Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP). Similar to backlinks, Google uses citations and listings to evaluate the authority and authenticity of your website. Some of the most popular online listings for healthcare businesses are:

Castle Connolly Top Doctors
RateMDs
HealthGrades
Vitals
Yelp
WebMDs
Caredash
AMA Doctor Finder
U.S. News Doctor Rankings
Zocdoc

When searching for “best optometrist atlanta”, structured directories are high ranking results.
To optimize your citations and listings, ensure you provide accurate and timely information about your practice. Also, be consistent in all of your listings. For example, if your company is listed as “Healthcare Essential” on some directories, don’t list your business as “Healthcare Essential, LLC” on other platforms–you’re going to confuse both search engines and patients.
Optimize Google Business Profile
Google Business Profile or GBP (formerly Google My Business) is a free online tool that lets you reach patients through Google Search and Google Maps. With an optimized Business Profile, you can share accurate information with patients and gain credibility with reviews. 64% of consumers use GBP to find information about local businesses, including addresses and phone numbers. This stat emphasizes the importance of a robust GBP listing to connect with potential patients and remove barriers to conversion.
Below are the steps to optimize your Business Profile:

Ensure NAP consistency: NAP helps potential patients identify and find your practice. Your NAP should be consistent anywhere your practice appears online to ensure clarity.
Write a short blurb: GBP allows you to write a brief description of your practice. Provide a short but relevant description of your practice instead of cramming in as many keywords as possible. Keep it professional, so avoid grammatical/spelling errors and promotions.
Add facility and staff photos: Consumers are frequently anxious about their healthcare journey and are uneasy when dealing with providers. Adding pictures can do wonders in demystifying your practice and making you appear more approachable. Upload photos of your exterior, interior (including reception, care delivery areas, equipment), and your staff at work.

Create dedicated landing pages
For multi-location healthcare organizations, creating a dedicated landing page for each location or service line is non-negotiable. You can’t just always link your home page or service pages in all of your marketing efforts–that would hurt your ability to provide personalized experiences. When 71% of consumers expect personalization when engaging with brands, you can’t afford to serve cookie-cutter digital experiences. Geo-optimized landing pages help you solve this problem.
Landing pages help improve patient satisfaction by giving them exactly what they want through relevant, personalized, and actionable content. Landing pages are unique destinations of your healthcare website–one page usually represents one of your locations. So when patients search for a medical service with a location identifier, they’ll find your geo-targeted landing page with custom characteristics.
Landing pages are also prime real estate for incorporating local and geographic keywords, further enhancing your local SEO presence. Plus, landing pages can have one or two CTAs where you can guide patients on the “next step” based on their needs, improving the conversion flow.
 
6. Track and Monitor the Campaign
At Cardinal, we believe that whatever gets measured can be improved. This is especially relevant in digital marketing, where if you’re not measuring, you are guessing. As mentioned, SEO is an ongoing process where a current strategy may work at one time and stop being effective the next. So you need to be able to act and adapt quickly, or you’ll end up wasting valuable resources.
There’s more to SEO than driving traffic to your website; you’ll also want to track other critical metrics such as:

Click-through rate (CTR)
Exit rate
Pages per session
Avg. page load times
Backlinks and referring domains
Top keywords performance
Bounce rates
Domain authority
Leads and conversion rates
Social shares
Engagement rate
Landing page

Thankfully, many tools let you track and monitor every piece of SEO data. This enables you to know which marketing pieces are delivering the results you want or not. However, having access to all this information, while empowering, can also feel overwhelming. An SEO agency can help you track the most critical metrics in your SEO campaign–ones that can actually move the needle with your marketing efforts.
Perhaps the most crucial tool for SEO tracking is Google Analytics. This tool allows healthcare marketers to track, analyze, and report data regarding their websites.
 
Elevate Your Healthcare SEO Marketing Today
SEO is a cornerstone of digital marketing efforts, especially for healthcare organizations. In reality, physicians and other practitioners can’t rely on referrals, word of mouth, and traditional advertising anymore. By incorporating the above mentioned tactics, your healthcare website will have a more robust search presence and attract higher-quality leads.
However, you must remember that SEO is a continuous process and an ongoing commitment, especially when it takes about 6-12 months to see meaningful results. But trust us; the rewards are more than worth the wait and effort.

                            Think of this as your preliminary search wellness check-up. We analyze your SEO and AI visibility as-is, conducting assessments to compare your rankings and recommendations against competitors, discover your traffic share percentage, and collect backlink profiles. We also review how your brand appears in AI platforms like ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews. Then we conduct a robust technical audit to identify red flags and top priorities. These findings are built into our SEO + AI roadmaps to ensure all roadblocks to visibility are eliminated.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Local SEO at Scale
                        
                            At its core, healthcare is a local service. So, how do you develop local SEO strategies for dozens or hundreds of locations? You need an organized and scalable SEO strategy if you want to reach patients across markets. We have deep experience managing the complexities of scaling local SEO strategies from 20 locations to more than 500.
Our SEO strategies will provide your business with a bird’s eye view of your brand’s performance, as well as drill-down data in each of your local or regional markets
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        AI SEO
                        
                            AI-generated results are reshaping how patients find care. From Google’s AI Overviews to ChatGPT, more decisions start with machine-generated recommendations. We help your brand earn a spot in these summaries by aligning content, technical structure, and trust signals with what AI systems value. Our approach blends proven SEO fundamentals with AI-specific tactics (like entity optimization, sentiment monitoring, and visibility tracking) so you stay competitive in both traditional and AI-driven search.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Multi-location Citation Management
                        
                            Citations are a critical ranking factor for local search, and they can get messy as you scale. We ensure your business is listed accurately in each of your growing markets, enabling referral traffic and earning real estate on Google’s first page. Clean, consistent citations also strengthen the trust signals AI systems use when surfacing local recommendations.
                        
                    

                    
                    
                        
                        Entity-based SEO Strategies
                        
                            As user queries become more unique, Google uses entities to match user intent to results—even when the keywords aren’t an exact match. AI SEO tools rely on similar entity-based logic. We help you identify the core concepts that prospective patients are searching for. These insights become the foundation for high-ranking content strategies and ensure you show up in both organic and AI-generated results.

                            Some agencies will acquire backlinks from who-knows-where and point them to your site willy-nilly. Not us. We have a dedicated in-house link-building team that strategically sources high-quality backlinks from high DA websites, injecting your site with the quality and reliability that prospective patients—and search engines—will trust. These authoritative links also contribute to the credibility AI models look for when selecting sources.

We can help you refresh your existing site, migrate you to a more user- and SEO-friendly platform, or start from scratch with a brand-new site that’s built to perform in both traditional and AI-driven search.

                Let’s Answer Your Questions About  Healthcare SEO 

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                        Why is SEO important for healthcare?
                                            
                    
                        
                            When a medical need emerges, the first place healthcare consumers go for information is a search engine. Will they find your brand on page one? If not, search engine optimization (SEO) can help you get there. 
SEO is the process of optimizing or improving your webpage, so it ranks higher on search engines. This is why healthcare SEO should be one of the main focus points for healthcare groups. A solid SEO strategy will establish your brand as a medical authority and help you build a sustainable pipeline of new patients. SEO puts your hospital, treatment center, nursing facility, or practice in front of healthcare consumers searching for your services.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What kind of results can I expect from Cardinal’s SEO services?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No matter how you choose to engage us, you can expect comprehensive, data-driven results that were expertly planned for and meticulously worked towards. Whether that’s increased leads and patient volume, higher levels of organic traffic, or better search rankings, we’ll set a goal at the beginning of each project and won’t stop until we’ve met it.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What’s the difference between AISO, AEO, and GEO, and which should I focus on?
                                            
                    
                        
                            So, here’s the scoop:
AISO (AI Search Optimization) is all about making sure your content shows up in AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. It helps your content get discovered by AI systems that are changing the way people search.
AEO (AI Engine Optimization) takes things a step further by tweaking how your content is structured so that search engines better understand it and serve it up to the right audience.
GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) focuses on getting your content referenced and cited in AI-generated results. It’s about being seen and included in the kind of conversational search experiences people are increasingly using.
Which should you focus on? It depends on your business goals. If you’re just starting out with AI search, you’ll want to prioritize AISO and AEO to make sure your content is visible and well-structured. But if you’re looking to position your brand at the forefront and get cited in those generative AI results, GEO should be your focus. It’s about understanding where your brand can get the most visibility.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How can my brand appear in AI-generated answers and overviews?
                                            
                    
                        
                            To appear in AI-generated answers, focus on creating high-quality, relevant content that aligns with user intent. AI search engines like Google’s AI Overviews and ChatGPT pull from sources like your Google Business Profile, reviews, and third-party content. Optimize your content to be authoritative, specific, and clear, and manage your online reputation, as AI looks at sentiment and user feedback too. By focusing on trust and differentiation, your brand can be cited in AI-driven answers.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Is AI SEO worth investing in?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, investing in AI SEO is essential as search behavior shifts toward AI-driven results. Traditional SEO isn’t enough anymore. AI search engines prioritize relevance, intent, and trust over keywords. By optimizing for AI, you ensure your brand appears in AI-generated recommendations and stays competitive in the evolving search landscape.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How do you measure AI SEO success?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Measuring your ranking in AI search engines is a bit different from traditional SEO. Instead of just tracking clicks, you’ll want to track your AI visibility—how often your brand is mentioned in AI-generated summaries or answers. You can use tools to track sentiment (how AI talks about your brand) and AI referral traffic (how many people are coming to your site from AI-driven results). It’s all about measuring your presence, perception, and performance in the AI space, as AI is looking at more than just keyword rankings now. It’s also about how your content is presented and perceived across AI platforms.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How long does it take to see ROI for SEO services?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We set performance-based goals for all our clients every three months, and you’ll typically start to see your SEO services pay off in about 3-6 months—though quick fixes can happen immediately. For example, if we see obvious issues with duplicative content, 404 error pages, or unclaimed Google Business Profiles (GBPs), we can fix those within the first month. 
We create robust SEO roadmaps, so you have complete transparency into your SEO strategy, the activities that support it, and the expected impact.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Do I need to create a Google Business Profile for each location AND provider?
                                            
                    
                        
                            For multi-location healthcare groups, we recommend that you only create Google Business Profiles for each location. If you create GBPs for both locations AND providers, it can create cannibalization issues. Some providers might outrank the overall location and hurt visibility to other providers in the group, for example. It gets messy, real quick.
Don’t confuse users and Google. Create GBPs for locations only. You can highlight providers at the locations by using healthcare directories like Healthgrades, RateMDs, ZocDoc, etc.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What are the top SEO considerations for merging sites to ensure I don’t lose rankings or traffic?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Merging healthcare brands is a multi-step process, even beyond SEO. First, we recommend you get access to the acquired brand’s Google Analytics and Search Console. You need benchmark data for at least three months. This will help you understand how performance is impacted after the migration. Then, it’s time to build a robust redirect map so Google can re-index pages appropriately.  
This is a big undertaking, and we recommend the help of experts to ensure no loss in rankings.

It's some of the best I’ve seen in my career.

                A New Age of Healthcare Consumers 

                
                
                Why  TikTok  for Healthcare?

                
                
            

            
            
                Social media is quickly becoming a go-to place for healthcare advice, particularly for younger Americans. Because Gen-Z consumers are aging into adulthood and making their own healthcare decisions for the first time, TikTok is playing an important role in the patient journey.
Unlike traditional corporate channels, TikTok feels more authentic and credible due to the prevalence of user-generated content that is easy to understand and relate to. It provides a strong sense of community, allowing users to connect with others who share similar experiences and seek support.
By leveraging TikTok, healthcare providers can connect with younger patients, as well as Millennial parents (aged 30-45) who are making healthcare decisions for themselves and their children.

                TikTok Advertising Frequently Asked Questions 

                
                
                TikTok is a  new channel  for healthcare. Get answers for all your burning questions.

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                        What makes TikTok advertising worth the money?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Let’s be clear, TikTok marketing isn’t the right option for every single healthcare specialty. Not every specialty is the right fit for the demography. The healthcare specialties that tend to thrive on TikTok consist of mental health, addiction treatment, cosmetic dentistry, pediatrics, dermatology, plastic surgery, and women’s health. 
All things aside, if your organization is looking to connect with younger patients, drive revenue through targeted campaigns, and natively build your brand through UGC, a TikTok advertising strategy that works well is worth the money. It all comes down to if your target patient population is on the channel and how valuable they are to your business. 
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        What does a TikTok marketing agency do?
                                            
                    
                        
                            The real question is: what don’t we do? A TikTok marketing agency ensures your TikTok ads reach potential and existing patients to drive real results to your business. We start by creating a custom assessment of your goals, target audience(s), location, and messaging. We’ll devise a video content strategy based on trend research, patient engagement, and performance data. Our team will even create short-form video content for you—see more below. Once the plan is in motion, we monitor your TikTok ad performance with custom dashboard reports and continually optimize campaigns to ensure a steady stream of patients. If that all sounds like a win, that’s because it is!
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Who makes the content for TikTok ads?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We do it, or you can! Our team will get to know you through the initial discovery process and familiarize ourselves with your offerings, style, and tone of voice. Once we get a feel for your brand, we’ll storyboard, write, plan, and shoot. We can capture video for you or collaborate with your creative team to capture video content. We also can help you source user-generated content from your patients to build authentic patient testimonial campaigns. 
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        How long are the contract terms?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We want you to be completely confident that you’re getting your money’s worth for your TikTok marketing, so we contract accordingly. It takes a few months of testing and optimizing to establish a steady, predictable pattern of results. We’ll sign you on for an initial six-month contract to set the magic in motion. Throughout this time, we set performance-based goals for all our clients every 3 months, staying in constant communication with clients and continually monitoring performance to ensure they’re getting the results they expect.

                    I'm so pleased and grateful to see the collaboration within the team, the work being accomplished, and the results that we are achieving together. 400+ animal hospitals is a lot to scale marketing for but between the Cardinal + SVP teams we have grown lead volume while lowering CPL over the last 3 years together.

                            In today’s competitive marketplace, your veterinary hospital’s website needs search engine optimization (SEO). If your site is not highly ranked, prospective patients will not find you. Most searchers never make it past the first page. Cardinal will target specific keywords and markets to get your search rankings where they need to be.

                            Paid social platforms such as Facebook have millions of users in the U.S.; tapping into this market can help you reach the people interested in the treatments you offer. We use segmentation to identify prospective clients based on location, age, gender, and estimated income to offer you high conversion rates and qualified leads.

A strong conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategy can help increase the quality of your leads and make the most out of the traffic you’re already receiving.

At Cardinal, we’re passionate about monitoring performance and communicating results; you’ll receive access to all of your data, dashboards, and reports.

                            We specialize in filling appointment books for veterinary practices, ensuring each location meets its capacity goals. Underperforming clinics get new clients, while fully booked offices avoid wasted ad spend, helping your entire system thrive.

                            Juggling data from multiple locations can feel like herding cats. We bring all your marketing data together in one place, giving you clear insights to make smarter decisions and grow your veterinary organization.

                            Pet owners don’t want “corporate vet” experiences—they want the familiarity and trust of their local vet. We help you build authentic local connections to ensure your practice resonates with the communities you serve.

                            Staffing shortages are hitting vet clinics hard, leaving teams stretched thin and pets turned away. We help you stand out to top candidates with smart recruitment marketing strategies, ensuring you attract skilled vets and support staff.

                        

                        
                    

                    

                    
                
            
        

        
    







    
    


    
    
        
            

                
                
                Frequently Asked Questions

                
                
            
        
    

    
    
        

            
            

                
                
                    
                         Do I need a brand-new website to market my veterinary clinic?
                                            
                    
                        
                            No. We can start crafting your marketing campaign if you have a functional WordPress website with a good design and structure. We always recommend WordPress to our clients because it’s easy to use, highly customizable, has a well-designed backend, and is SEO-friendly. Otherwise, we may have to deal with optimization challenges and not reach your campaign’s full potential.
If your website could be better designed and structured, our talented web design specialists will help transfer your website to WordPress from any platform or even make a brand-new site from scratch. We can guarantee a professional-looking website that loads quickly, has strong SEO foundations, and works perfectly on both desktop and mobile.
Furthermore, your veterinary website will contain all the necessary information that visitors need and be gently guided toward your conversion funnels–this means higher conversion rates and more kitties and puppies to care for.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Will it take too long before I can see actual results?
                                            
                    
                        
                            It depends on what you consider “too long.” One thing you need to know about digital marketing is that it takes time. It’s a multi-pronged approach consisting of various long-term strategies that take time to develop and execute. This is why we always encourage our clients to manage their expectations about their campaign results. If you want immediate results from your campaign, Cardinal is not the agency for you.
Regarding the timeframe of results, they will largely depend on the current state of your marketing, your competition, and your required services. For example, a PPC campaign is quick to launch and may yield favorable results within 30 days after optimization, but a more realistic estimate would be 90 days. On the other hand, a full-scale SEO plan may take 4-6 months to a year before it produces meaningful results.
We always set performance-based goals for all our clients every three months. To help ensure transparency, we provide in-depth reports, KPIs, dashboards, and strategy roadmaps you can always access.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Will Cardinal handle all areas of marketing for my veterinary clinic?
                                            
                    
                        
                            We can if you want us to.
As a full-service digital marketing agency, Cardinal doesn’t just offer a wide range of services to grow your vet clinic; we also deliver integrated and cohesive campaigns that integrate all our core services. From SEO to PPC management to conversion rate optimization to Facebook advertising, you can trust that every service you hire us for will support each other to achieve your goals. However, we do not provide email marketing, social media posts, and traditional “offline” advertising (we’re a digital agency, after all).
What makes us stand out from a sea of digital marketing agencies is our expertise and experience in the healthcare arena. Our services are trusted by some of the most prominent names in the veterinary field, and we have the results from successful campaigns to back up our claims.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        We’re getting good traffic to our veterinary website, but patient growth remains stagnant. How can you help?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Your current digital marketing campaign may not drive more qualified leads to your website, so it’s undoubtedly a conversion rate issue. Fortunately, conversion rate optimization, or CRO, is one of our core services.
For starters, we’ll evaluate if there’s a mismatch between your ad messaging and landing pages or if you’re using the wrong set of keywords. There’s a good chance you’re still linking your PPC ads to your home page or generic service pages, which is a common mistake. One step to correct this is to create conversion-focused landing pages that align with your ads.
If people don’t find what they’re looking for after clicking one of your ads, they’ll quickly bounce. Cardinal will help optimize conversions by developing landing pages that match your ad messaging and search intent.
                        
                    
                

                
                
                    
                        Can you market my vet clinic to focus on unexpected high-value services like emergency surgeries or wound treatment?
                                            
                    
                        
                            Yes, we can. As your marketing partner, one of our goals is to support your priority service lines.
If you want to attract patients looking for high-value veterinary services (e.g., wound treatment, bloodwork, emergency surgery, etc.), we can focus on targeting them first, then work our way toward your general service lines.
Through our specialty marketing solutions like SEO and PPC, we can increase awareness for your veterinary clinic and put it in front of people who need help for their pups and kittens. We enhance the results of these core strategies by crafting a customized veterinary marketing plan which will result in higher-quality leads and better conversion rates.

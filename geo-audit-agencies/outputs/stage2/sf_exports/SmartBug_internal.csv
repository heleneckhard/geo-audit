                The Challenge
                When Ashling Partners, one of the largest intelligent automation service providers in North America, first approached SmartBug, it needed a digital agency with a fresh approach to in-person conference engagement and an increase in MQLs.
              
            
            
              
              
                The Solution
                SmartBug created a uniquely branded interactive experience to increase visitor engagement and booth interaction. At the event’s close, Ashling Partners saw a 7x increase in booth visits year over year (YoY), 183 new MQLs, and 18 new demo requests.

                The Challenge
                MW Components, an engineering product manufacturer, came to SmartBug with a tall order: overhauling the company’s sales processes, unifying systems, and streamlining access to shared data.

                The Challenge
                When a global leader in medical device and diagnostic consulting needed a new strategy to reach Tier 1 partners, those with $100 million+ in annual revenue, SmartBug went back to the basics with a website redesign and carefully crafted digital marketing strategy.

                When California Olive Ranch first approached SmartBug, it was ready to overhaul its e-commerce strategy and increase revenue, with a specific focus on SMS and email campaigns. 
              
            
            
              
              
                The Solution
                SmartBug strategists quickly crafted a targeted e-commerce campaign with strategic workflows and audience segmentation. The popular olive oil brand has seen a 58 percent increase YoY in orders placed, a 145 percent increase in campaign open rates, a 62.65 percent increase in Klaviyo-attributed revenue, and a 130 percent increase in placed-order rate.

Senior living organizations have distinctive customer relationship management needs that require property management and resident management functionality. 












Managing occupancy means ensuring apartments are filled as much as possible, which requires an intuitive system that can communicate with operations when an apartment needs renovation for an incoming resident or when a maintenance issue needs to be resolved.

Senior living communities also have a responsibility to manage the quality of care for residents. This necessitates having HIPAA-protected data (such as medications or health conditions), family and doctor contact information, and billing information readily accessible.
Senior living communities face unique challenges in human resources, building maintenance, and staffing to provide exceptional care. Juggling all of these pieces with disparate systems can be overwhelming, but Senior Living CRM powered by HubSpot is changing the game.












    






  

























    






  















Our Senior Living CRM powered by HubSpot is specifically designed for senior living communities and is configured for the entire resident journey, including marketing, sales, and resident engagement and support. This platform minimizes the amount of tools you need, supporting efficiency and reducing costs by putting all of your operations in a unified workspace.

💡The best part? The platform is HIPAA-compliant. 

Let’s take a closer look at how your community can unlock its potential.

How Senior Living Communities Can Improve Resident Satisfaction and Better Manage Operations with One Intuitive Solution







Resident care and satisfaction, family engagement, operational efficiency ... these are all essential components of a vibrant community that helps residents live their best lives. 



















Unfortunately, a lack of integrated systems to manage resident profiles, communicate with families, and attract and retain skilled staff members can result in several challenges. These challenges can include problems managing resident information and keeping an open line of communication with their families, several operational inefficiencies, difficulty attracting new residents, and trouble making informed decisions because of insufficient reporting capabilities. 
This is where SmartBug and HubSpot come in. Say goodbye to inefficient systems and all of the challenges that come with them, and say hello to:

Power Your Operations with an Intuitive Senior Living CRM







Senior Living CRM is a comprehensive solution that enhances the entire resident experience while making it easy for your teams to do what they do best. Let’s explore the full capabilities of this powerful platform.



















Easily Meet Residents’ Needs
Give your residents the personalized care they deserve without sacrificing privacy. 













    






  















Detailed electronic health records (EHR) are essential for giving caregivers and providers in your community what they need to meet each resident’s needs. EHR files can be integrated within the CRM to track and manage residents’ health records, medications, treatments, and medical histories.
Sensitive data such as medical histories and personal health information is encrypted and doesn’t compromise privacy. Senior Living CRM lets your community manage this sensitive information in a compliant manner, ensuring only those with access can see this information. 
The CRM can also facilitate remote consultations and virtual care visits with residents’ primary care providers so they can continue getting the care they need from the providers they know and trust.




















HIPAA-Compliant Data Storage
Our HIPAA-compliant Senior Living CRM restricts access to private health information so only those who need it can access it.












    






  




















Enhance the Resident Experience
Amenities, activities, and special events keep residents happy and engaged and are some of the top benefits of senior living. They’re also key to attracting new residents to the community.












Senior Living CRM has the tools you need to plan and manage resident activities and events, promoting high levels of resident engagement and socialization. The platform’s intuitive systems can help you manage the entire event-planning process from invitation to follow-up and can even help you manage online events or in-person event registration.

You can use the tools in the platform to plan, host, and track your events. Managing invitations, new events, RSVPs, and attendee engagement has never been easier with the intuitive and streamlined interface.
The platform has several built-in systems that will enable your community to better connect with residents and their families through newsletters, notifications, and community updates. It also elevates your community’s engagement efforts with current residents (and lead nurturing efforts for prospective residents!) by organizing ongoing events that improve resident satisfaction and foster closer relationships between residents and staff members.













    






  
























    






  
















While this functionality is beneficial for current residents, it also helps bring in new prospective residents by enabling your teams to craft, monitor, and assess campaigns designed for lead generation. Personalized marketing efforts will help you attract more prospective residents, nurture existing leads, and elevate your community’s market presence.
💡 Senior Living CRM provides all the tools you need to plan events and activities for current and prospective residents, from planning the event to managing invites, RSVPs, and attendee engagement.




















Streamline Staff Recruitment and Retention
Staff members are an integral part of caring for residents and making sure the community runs smoothly. The staff management systems in the senior living software enhance staffing processes with specialized recruitment marketing tools. These tools can be used for posting job openings, tracking applicants, and managing the entire candidate experience to help address the unique talent acquisition challenges in the senior living industry.













    






  















Senior Living CRM streamlines the entire recruitment process, helping you attract high-quality candidates while reducing turnover by managing onboarding, scheduling, staff performance, and training. The system is also beneficial for managing time tracking, payroll, and benefits administration, thus simplifying the entire staff management process from the start.








 💡 Streamline your entire staff recruitment process and reduce turnover with an intuitive system for managing staff onboarding, scheduling, training, and payroll.




















Create Impactful Marketing and Sales Outreach Campaigns
Manage and execute your marketing campaigns directly in Senior Living CRM, and then measure which efforts are the most successful with the platform’s consolidated reporting and analytics features. The customized reporting dashboards are specially designed for the senior living industry to monitor the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, conversion rates, HR activities, and more, so you can make informed, data-driven decisions across all aspects of your community’s operations.













    






  












The CRM’s advanced reporting dashboards enable your community to analyze sales outreach and performance, empowering your leadership team to refine outreach strategies and enhance the sales process. The interface also provides a clear overview of all upcoming activities and reminders for follow-up, all tailored to the unique needs of the senior living industry.
You can further drive engagement with your campaigns and website with interactive content that enhances prospective residents’ experiences by incorporating cost calculators, floor plans, and more features that can increase lead generation and drive the conversion of leads to residents.

The transition to senior living can be stressful for residents and their families. It’s essential to ensure a smooth transition for residents moving in or out and to keep satisfaction levels high among residents and their families.
By using HubSpot’s custom objects within Senior Living CRM, you can easily manage detailed records of people who are moving in or moving out or who made a deposit. This information lives alongside information on floor plans, apartment statuses, and resident agreements. A comprehensive overview of occupancy trends efficiently facilitates apartment assignments while streamlining the entire reservation process.








💡 Manage all details of residents moving in or out as well as updated information about your community, including floor plans and resident agreements, to streamline the entire apartment reservation process.




















Accelerate Your Sales and Leads Process












This single platform can manage all your sales efforts, allowing your sales team to excel in their roles and speed up follow-ups with qualified leads. You can automate workflow tools to send emails and assign tasks to sales reps, then use lead management and task prioritization features to prioritize highly qualified leads, making sure they’re contacted first and that important sales opportunities are advanced within the pipeline.
You’ll also have real-time, advanced reporting capabilities that enable you to analyze sales trends and performance, empowering your leadership team to refine campaigns and strategies and enhance the process of turning a lead into a resident.








💡 Use tools within the CRM to prioritize highly qualified leads to ensure they’re contacted first and advanced within the pipeline.












    






  
















Efficiently Manage Billing and Invoicing













    






  















Manage all of your financial tasks under one roof with tools for financial planning, budgeting, and generating financial reports. Use the integrated billing systems to manage resident accounts, invoicing, and payment tracking so that nothing important is overlooked.












Quickly Resolve Service Requests and Issues












Senior Living CRM uses HubSpot’s ticketing and issue tracking features to efficiently manage community maintenance, repairs, and renovations, including residents’ service requests, ensuring quick turnaround and high resident satisfaction. Fast and smooth service will build residents’ trust in your community’s commitment to their care and satisfaction.
The system also helps you handle work order management and preventive maintenance scheduling and enables you to track and manage physical assets within the community.
Any senior living community’s top priority is for its residents to be satisfied and have what they need to remain happy and healthy. The CRM allows you to survey residents to ensure you’re consistently meeting and exceeding resident expectations. You can then use this information to make adjustments where needed, providing a secure and enjoyable community for current and new residents alike.












    






  
















💡 Use the advanced issue tracking and ticketing system to manage maintenance requests, community repairs, and more, ensuring quick turnaround and high resident satisfaction.








Make Use of Resident and Family Portals
Communicating with residents’ families is essential for any senior living community. Unfortunately, many of the current tools available don’t make that communication easy. 













    






  















The self-service portals built into Senior Living CRM give you better options and tools for effectively communicating with families and managing residents’ profiles. The portals enable residents and their families to easily access information, communicate with your team members, schedule services, and stay updated on events happening in your community. 
💡Communicate easier with families and manage resident profiles more efficiently with an easy-to-use resident portal.

        Overview

        Engineering product manufacturer MW Components needed a unified system for standardizing its sales processes that gave the team streamlined access to shared data.
Goal:
To organize, optimize, and clean up data functionality by planning and executing a full HubSpot CRM migration and integration
Result: 
Unified standardization of sales processes and in-depth training that allowed teams to work more efficiently and cohesively
Metrics

New software integration offers 360-degree views of the customer journey.
The sales team is now spending 5 percent less time on data management tasks.
Consultants created HubSpot custom objects to manage mega-groups.
Closed-loop reporting gave the leadership team full return visibility.


        
          
          

          
          

          
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        
          Background
        
        In need of trusted guidance, MW Components reached out to SmartBug regarding an extensive overhaul of its sales process and data management systems. Knowing that the SmartBug team has the strategic expertise, technical capabilities, and HubSpot knowledge to facilitate such an effort, MW Components tasked us with an integration of its ERP and migration of its CRM systems. Creating better harmony between these two systems would allow all revenue teams (marketing, sales, customer service, and finance) to connect and track customer data at every stage of the buyer’s journey.
In short, this responsibility involved migrating existing data to a new software platform, HubSpot CRM, and integrating this system with MW Components’ ERP. The intended results of the migration and integration were to improve the user interface, better visualize sales data, and clearly define internal marketing and sales processes.

            The Problem
          
          Manual Forecasting and Siloed Data Lead to Inefficiencies and Blindspots
As revenue increased and the business grew, MW Components faced several operational challenges, including disorganized data and misaligned teams. Optimizing these elements on a company-wide scale would present an additional challenge for leadership. Knowing this, the company recruited SmartBug to execute a large-scale data migration and provide strategic guidance throughout the process.
With limited bandwidth, MW Components needed a reliable partner to ensure the systems were set up properly under its new RevOps strategy, train its staff on new functions, and offer ongoing technical support. Priorities included implementing visual closed-loop reporting, unifying marketing and sales, automating forecasts, integrating their ERP and CRM systems to eliminate data silos, and adding new functionality with custom objects. Fortunately, SmartBug could handle everything MW Components wanted to accomplish under one roof.

          
            
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              
                Our current systems did not cleanly integrate with each other. There were attempts made to integrate them, but it never seemed to work. ... The main issue I'd say was [not being able to access] the full story from a lead to an opportunity to a sale.

        Overview

        When a global leader in medical device and diagnostic consulting needed a new strategy to reach Tier 1 partners, SmartBug® went back to basics with a website redesign followed by a robust online marketing campaign.

          Background
        
        The company recently experienced a merger and needed help rebranding and revitalizing its sales funnel. Attendance at live trade shows and conferences usually generated a significant number of leads, and that funnel dried up almost entirely when COVID-19 swept the globe in 2020. The situation spurred leadership to find a marketing partner that could pull the levers needed to regain the business’s pre-pandemic momentum.
SmartBug had a team of specialists—strategy, paid media, design, web development, and content creation—in place to meet the business’s objectives for improved efficiency and increased engagement. Even better? By utilizing key partners like the HubSpot platform, Vidyard, and RollWorks, metrics to prove the utility of our efforts are always available.
“We initially came to SmartBug to help us scale, improve brand awareness, and measure for data-driven marketing decisions. Most importantly, we needed to maximize our customer relationships, and to do that, we needed an expert. SmartBug’s in-depth knowledge of the HubSpot platform was exactly what we were looking for and allowed us to maximize our use of the platform,” the company spokesperson said.
      
    

    

    
      
        
        

        
          
            The Problem
          
          Finding New Ways to Connect
The consulting firm wanted to attract Tier 1 partners, those with $100 million in annual revenue. Without the ability to establish connections in person at various events, the company needed a new strategy to reach that same audience. And because their internal marketing team is small, they knew they needed a partner with the resources to cover all the bases.
Because building brand awareness, improving their reach to prospective clients, and managing current partner relationships were at the top of the firm’s priority list, SmartBug strategists put a plan together that focused on attracting potential partners just starting their customer journey. The overall focus stayed on revenue generation, which proved to be the game-changer the company needed.   

          
            
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              
                What we do doesn’t translate easily into written content, but the SmartBug team is really hitting the mark with content appropriate for a Tier 1 audience
              
              
                
                  
                
              
              
                Company Spokesperson
              
            
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        
          
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        
          OUR SOLUTION
        
        A Fresh Perspective: Web Redesign and Strategic Approach to Martech
SmartBug’s web team dug into a redesign of the company’s website. At the same time, the marketing team launched top-of-funnel ABM campaigns that also incorporated other platforms to create a robust tech stack.
This multi-faceted approach was integral to the plan’s success:

Redesign of the website
Reengagement campaign
Smart content like video, live shows, webinars, white papers, and so on
Sales enablement through HubSpot and Salesforce
Data-driven decisions 

“The web project has been trial and error, and there has been incredible flexibility on both sides to make sure we’re getting it all right,” the company spokesperson said. “What we do doesn’t translate easily into written content, but the SmartBug team is really hitting the mark with content appropriate for a Tier 1 audience.”
      
    

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        The Results
        
        
        
        Rocketing Contact Rates and Conversions
A year after partnering with SmartBug, the consulting company is experiencing more than a 100 percent increase in contacts from potential Tier 1 customers and a conversion rate of almost 10 percent.

New tier 1 contacts from online marketing are up 116% YoY and 38% QoQ
Tier 1 website sessions increased 15% YoY
Tier 1 campaign conversions increased 8% YoY
Record attendance during recent Live! show

“We just can’t do it all. Our weekly call with our SmartBug team reinforces our decision to partner with SmartBug because all the different angles we need are being addressed. We all have each other’s backs, which just goes to show how SmartBug is just an extension of our team here.
“The sales enablement process has been a huge initiative, and working with SmartBug helps us empower our sales team. Through the HubSpot and Salesforce connection, we bring sales and service together. SmartBug is so much more than marketing; they’re our revenue-generation partner.”

Background
Learning Matters Educational Group (LMEG), a growing network of charter schools, needed to centralize its marketing operations and improve enrollment workflows across multiple locations. The organization turned to SmartBug Media to implement HubSpot, consolidate data from multiple sources, and develop targeted marketing strategies.

















  
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Problem
Disjointed Marketing and Technology Limitations Threaten Growth
Marketing teams often have ambitious goals, but LMEG had a particularly steep enrollment goal to achieve within a very short period of time. 
Due to charter school licensing restrictions that governed new schools and the traditional start of the school year, LMEG had less than three months to turn thousands of leads stored across multiple systems to reach their student enrollment goal.
Exacerbating the problem, LMEG had to coordinate the process across multiple sites with a geographically disbursed marketing team—and without a marketing and customer relationship management (CRM) solution tuned to the education industry.
        
      
    
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        LMEG encountered several obstacles in its marketing and enrollment efforts, including: 
1. The lack of a centralized platform that would provide the marketing and enrollment functionality needed to build, track, and maintain a strong pipeline of enrollees. 

2. The absence of a system to track leads and measure marketing success across the lead journey.
3. The need for an automated and scalable method to handle growth across schools within and across state lines.
4. Unique data processing and API requirements based on state laws and system requirements, such as separate personalized learning plan (PLP) systems for each state.
Drawing on her marketing background, Destiny Irons (Director of Communications at LMEG) knew that HubSpot could be the solution. However, LMEG would need to find a proven partner to not only achieve its ambitious enrollment goals but also develop a customized API to integrate its existing PLP and marketing solutions with specific requirements of its state-level student information systems.
        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  
  
  


















	
    
    
      
      In the education sector, technology adoption often lags behind other industries. This left us facing a huge challenge in establishing and coordinating our marketing and enrollment processes ... We were really struggling before we found HubSpot and SmartBug. Our marketing data was inconsistent to non-existent. 
      
      Destiny Irons, Director of Communications, LMEG.
      
    
    
	
	
	

















The Solution
Centralizing Marketing Operations with the Power of HubSpot
After carefully analyzing LMEG's marketing challenges, SmartBug Media developed a comprehensive solution to transform its fragmented marketing operations into a centralized, efficient system. SmartBug’s approach centered on leveraging HubSpot's powerful marketing platform to create a unified ecosystem for LMEG's multi-campus operation. 
A key part of this strategy was developing a custom API integration between LMEG's PLP system and HubSpot, enabling seamless data flow and eliminating manual entry errors. This integration allowed LMEG to capture detailed student information, create accurate family relationships, and track the entire enrollment journey from initial interest to final registration. 

















	
    
    
      
      What we created together hasn’t been done before ... We needed a way to capture student information, create family links, and close the loop from initial interest to enrollment—all within one platform—and within a very short period of time.
      
      Destiny Irons, Director of Communications, LMEG.
      
    
    
	
	
	

















SmartBug then helped LMEG to implement separate business units in Hubspot for each state they either currently had or were opening new schools within, which granted LMEG visibility across its entire network of schools and enhanced how the organization coordinated marketing efforts and measured impact. 
Paired with the technology enablement, SmartBug launched a comprehensive paid media strategy across Google Ads. SmartBug helped LMEG use HubSpot's integrated tools to manage, track, and optimize campaigns alongside traditional public relations campaigns in local communities. This combined approach allowed LMEG to reach its target audience more precisely, drive awareness, generate high-quality leads, and ultimately support its enrollment goals across different schools and states.
Finally, SmartBug worked closely with LMEG to establish standardized processes for forms, lifecycle stages, and lead routing, ensuring consistency across all campuses. This tailored solution not only addressed LMEG's immediate needs but also positioned the organization for future growth and scalability as its charter school network continues to grow.

The Results
Exceeding Enrollment Goals Through Streamlined Marketing

These outcomes also highlight the success of the organization’s new marketing operations, showcasing how proven marketing strategies and custom API implementation can work together with centralized processes, targeted advertising, and HubSpot's integrated tools. 
 Utilized lead nurturing to convert 35% of potential students into Enrolled Students

Demand Generation FAQs

















  
    
    
      
        What is demand generation?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Demand generation is the strategic process of creating interest and awareness in your brand, products, or services, with the ultimate goal of driving high-quality leads through every stage of the buyer's journey. At SmartBug Media, we approach demand generation as a holistic, full-lifecycle initiative—combining inbound marketing, paid media, content creation, and data-driven insights to engage your target audience, nurture relationships, and accelerate conversions. Our tailored strategies are designed to align sales and marketing efforts, delivering measurable ROI while fostering long-term customer growth and retention.
    
    
    
      
        How is demand generation different from ABM?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Demand generation and Account-Based Marketing (ABM) both aim to drive high-quality leads, but they differ in scope and execution.

At SmartBug Media, demand generation focuses on creating broad interest across a wider audience, nurturing prospects throughout the full customer lifecycle. It’s about casting a wide net to engage potential buyers at all stages of the flywheel, using tactics like content marketing, paid media, and SEO to attract and convert leads, as well as cross and upsell existing customers.

ABM, on the other hand, is a more targeted approach. It involves crafting personalized campaigns for specific high-value accounts, aligning marketing and sales teams to engage decision-makers directly within those organizations. While both strategies aim to build strong relationships and drive conversions, demand generation takes a broader, more scalable approach, whereas ABM is precise and highly tailored to a select group of key accounts.

In many cases, the two can complement each other, with demand generation creating general awareness and interest, and ABM zeroing in on high-priority prospects for deeper engagement.
    
    
    
      
        How is demand generation different from lead generation?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Demand generation and lead generation are both critical components of a successful marketing strategy, but they serve different purposes and operate at different stages of the buyer journey.

At SmartBug Media, demand generation focuses on creating awareness and interest across a wide audience, nurturing prospects through the entire customer lifecycle. It involves a mix of tactics—content marketing, SEO, paid media, and social outreach—to build brand awareness, educate the market, and spark curiosity, all aimed at driving long-term engagement with your brand. The goal is to create demand for your product or service, regardless of whether prospects are ready to buy immediately, and what lifecycle they're in.

Lead generation, on the other hand, is a subset of demand generation and focuses on capturing contact information from interested prospects who have already shown some level of interest. Lead generation typically uses tactics like gated content, webinars, or landing pages to convert that interest into actionable leads for your sales team to follow up on.

In essence, demand generation builds awareness and interest at every stage of the flywheel, while lead generation captures and qualifies the top of the funnel interest for sales, turning prospects into tangible leads. Both work together to fuel a full-funnel marketing strategy, driving growth and conversion.

					Step 1
					Audit Your Reputation
					
						Before you can improve your brand's online presence, you need to know where you stand with customers at the local level today. We'll take a look at your current channels to understand where you're making the biggest impact and flag opportunities to update any inaccurate or off-brand communication.
					
					
					
						
						Customer Reviews
						
						Social Media
						
					
					
          
				
			
			
			
			
			
			
    
    
    
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					Step 2
					Enhance Your Listings
					
						Next, we'll get to work cleaning up those listings that may take your customers off course. By enhancing core listings and associated pages, we can accurately pinpoint where we need to focus most on generating quality customer reviews that resonate with your local target audience. 
					
					
					
						
						Local SEO
						
						Employer Branding
						
						Customer Experience (CX) Strategy
						
						Fake Review Flagging
						
					
					
          
				
			
			
			
			
			
			
    
    
    
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					Step 3
					Respond to Customer Feedback
					
						We hope for five-star customer reviews every time, but we're also prepared to pivot when critical feedback comes up. Should customer reviews include less-than-stellar praise, our team is here to provide timely, empathetic, and on-brand responses for every negative review. 
					
					
					
						
						Facebook & Instagram
						
						Google Business Profile
						
					
					
          
				
			
			
			
			
			
			
    
    
    
			
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
					Step 4
					Promote Positive Reviews
					
						What better way to promote your greatest business successes than with the words of your customers themselves? Simply put: Your prospects want to hear from loyal, long-time customers. We'll work with your team to promote these positive reviews across social media, Google Business, and beyond.
					
					
					
						
						Facebook & Instagram
						
						Google Business Profile
						
						Public Relations Outreach
						
						SEO

Why Choose WordPress?













  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Open Code
    
    Its open code sets WordPress apart from other technologies, offering unrivaled flexibility and extensive customization.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Personalization
    
    WordPress provides a vast library of themes, suitable for a variety of sectors, and it offers full customization, allowing you to adjust design, functionality, and user experience.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Ease of Use
    
    WordPress stands out for its ease of use, thanks to its intuitive interface. Even without technical skills, you can manage content and add pages, images, and posts in just a few clicks.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Security
    
    WordPress takes security very seriously, with regular updates, robust security plug-ins, and a large community that quickly detects and fixes vulnerabilities.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Active Community
    
    The WordPress community is vast and dynamic, offering constant support via forums, tutorials, and events. Developers from all over the world contribute to improving the platform and creating innovative solutions.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Regular Updates
    
    WordPress offers regular updates to improve security, add new features, and fix bugs.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Evolutionary
    
    WordPress is highly scalable, allowing you to adapt to a site's growing needs. You can add new features, integrate external tools, and grow with your business.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Previewing & Versioning
    
    WordPress offers real-time preview capabilities, allowing you to see changes before publication. What's more, versioning lets you revert to previous versions of content.
    
  
  
  
    
    
      
      
      
      
    
    
    
      Plug-ins & Extensions
    
    WordPress offers thousands of plug-ins and extensions, providing a wide range of features such as SEO, security, e-commerce, and performance management. These tools let you add specific capabilities without coding.

					Chapter 1
					Introduction to HubSpot for Healthcare
					HubSpot centralizes patient, provider, and referral data into a single CRM, streamlining workflows, enhancing engagement, and ensuring compliance for a more efficient and personalized healthcare experience.
				
				
			

			
				
					Patient expectations have fundamentally changed, shaped by the personalized experiences they encounter in retail, hospitality, and other consumer-centric industries. They expect healthcare providers to offer easy scheduling, responsive communication, and tailored care journeys that build trust, nurture referrals, and improve health outcomes.
And yet, many healthcare organizations still struggle with disconnected technology—one platform for patient scheduling, another for billing, and separate tools for marketing and outreach. Staff spend hours reconciling fragmented patient information across platforms, providers face gaps in critical patient data, and frontline teams become bogged down by manual processes. This fragmentation not only frustrates patients and providers but also introduces compliance concerns, putting healthcare organizations at greater risk of HIPAA violations due to mishandled protected health information (PHI).
HubSpot for healthcare solves these issues by centralizing patient, provider, and referral data into a single, intuitive customer relationship management (CRM) platform. By connecting marketing, sales, and service teams, HubSpot provides real-time visibility into every patient and provider interaction. 
With a unified view across the entire patient journey, healthcare teams can personalize communications, streamline workflows, and ensure regulatory compliance—all while maintaining productivity. And with 70 percent of healthcare executives prioritizing operational efficiency and productivity gains this year, optimizing workflows has never been more critical.
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 2
					What Is a Healthcare CRM and Why Does It Matter?
					HubSpot’s healthcare CRM centralizes patient and provider data, automates engagement, and ensures HIPAA compliance to improve care and streamline operations.
				
				
			

			
				
					A healthcare CRM is a software platform specifically designed to help healthcare organizations manage relationships with patients, providers, referral networks, and stakeholders in one centralized place. Unlike traditional CRMs, healthcare CRMs are built to manage complex relationships and regulatory requirements unique to healthcare. A robust healthcare CRM helps organizations:

Segment and personalize patient and provider interactions: Tailor outreach based on patient demographics, conditions, appointment history, and communication preferences.


Track referrals and provider relationships: Capture detailed interactions and referral sources to optimize provider engagement and streamline referral processes.


Maintain compliance and protect sensitive data: Manage patient consent, track communication permissions, and ensure secure, auditable management of PHI in alignment with HIPAA guidelines.


Automate patient engagement: Deliver timely reminders, educational content, and follow-ups through automated workflows, reducing administrative burden and enhancing patient adherence.

Healthcare CRMs differ from generic CRMs by incorporating mandatory compliance features—such as advanced permissions, audit logging, and encryption—to manage sensitive data according to HIPAA regulations. HubSpot’s healthcare CRM provides these essential capabilities, combining flexible customization with built-in HIPAA compliance to help healthcare organizations better manage patient relationships, streamline workflows, and improve outcomes at every step.
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 3
					Top CRM Challenges Healthcare Organizations Face
					Healthcare organizations struggle with inefficiency, compliance risks, and misalignment when using generic or disconnected CRMs not built for healthcare-specific workflows—challenges a purpose-built healthcare CRM like HubSpot is designed to solve.
				
				
			

			
				
					Healthcare organizations face significant challenges when they rely on disconnected or generic CRMs not built for healthcare-specific workflows. These challenges impact patient experience, operational efficiency, and regulatory compliance—key drivers of organizational success. 


Compliance Risks
Generic CRMs often lack the security controls needed to protect PHI, increasing the risk of data breaches, compliance violations, and reputational harm. Without features such as audit logging, advanced encryption, and automated consent management, organizations struggle to maintain HIPAA compliance. 
Manual data handling across disconnected systems further heightens the risk of errors and unauthorized access. A healthcare CRM mitigates these risks by embedding compliance into its core, ensuring secure data management and reducing the possibility of costly penalties.


Fragmented Systems and Data Silos
A recent Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) survey revealed that 57 percent of physicians identify interoperability as their primary obstacle in maximizing health IT. When critical patient information—such as appointment histories, communication records, or referral details—exists in isolated systems, healthcare teams lack the unified view required to deliver efficient, personalized care.
Disconnected systems lead to repeated administrative tasks, delayed provider communications, and disjointed patient experiences. Staff often spend significant time manually reconciling data between platforms, diverting valuable hours from patient care and relationship management.
Centralized CRM solutions tailored specifically for healthcare workflows solve these issues by integrating multiple platforms—such as electronic health records (EHRs), billing software, telehealth tools, and marketing systems—into one accessible, cohesive system.


Long, Complex Sales Cycles
Healthcare sales cycles typically involve multiple clinical, financial, and operational stakeholders. Generic CRM platforms typically aren't designed for multi-stakeholder engagement or lengthy sales cycles, which can span several months or even years.
To effectively manage lengthy sales cycles involving multiple departments, healthcare teams need a CRM that captures detailed stakeholder conversations, tracks specific regulatory milestones, and automates follow-up tasks. Without these capabilities, organizations risk stalled deals, miscommunications, or lost opportunities as sales teams struggle to maintain continuity and clarity across interactions.


Misalignment Between Teams
When marketing, sales, and service departments rely on separate systems, critical patient and provider insights become siloed, limiting visibility into the complete patient journey. For instance, marketing teams may collect consent and communication preferences, but if this information isn’t shared with service teams, it can lead to non-compliant patient interactions or missed engagement opportunities.
Unified CRMs break down these silos, giving every team clear access to patient data, interaction history, and consent details. This alignment ensures teams operate from the same information, creating more cohesive patient communications and significantly improving organizational efficiency.
Addressing these common challenges requires a CRM built specifically with healthcare workflows in mind—which is where HubSpot excels.

					How HubSpot Solves These CRM Challenges
					HubSpot is built for healthcare, offering secure, compliant CRM tools that unify data, automate workflows, and streamline patient and provider engagement.
				
				
			

			
				
					Effectively addressing CRM challenges in healthcare demands a platform specifically built to handle sensitive patient information, complex provider relationships, and strict compliance standards. HubSpot meets these demands by centralizing data, automating critical healthcare workflows, and giving teams clear visibility into patient and provider journeys.


HIPAA Compliance and Secure Data Management
HubSpot provides built-in compliance tools to securely manage PHI, including robust encryption, detailed audit logging, and role-based permissions. These features empower healthcare organizations to confidently handle sensitive data within HubSpot, mitigating potential HIPAA violations and data security issues.
To further strengthen security, healthcare teams can configure HubSpot to:

Manage patient consent and opt-out preferences directly in the CRM.


Automatically trigger alerts for potential data access or compliance issues.


Create audit trails that document all interactions involving PHI, ensuring transparency and accountability across every patient and provider touchpoint.



Unified Patient and Provider Data Management
HubSpot consolidates patient, provider, and referral partner data into one location, making critical information immediately accessible. This unified record provides comprehensive visibility into every patient and provider interaction—from initial inquiry and referral to ongoing care and follow-up.
With HubSpot, healthcare teams can:

Personalize patient communications based on detailed interaction histories and care milestones.


Coordinate seamless handoffs between marketing, clinical, and administrative teams, eliminating friction caused by disconnected systems.


Track referral patterns, provider engagement, and patient journeys with clear, real-time insights.



Personalized, Automated Patient and Provider Journeys
HubSpot’s powerful automation and segmentation tools allow healthcare teams to deliver personalized patient journeys at scale. Organizations can design automated workflows triggered by patient or provider interactions, such as scheduled appointments, missed visits, or referral activities.
For example, healthcare teams can leverage HubSpot automation to:

Automatically send appointment reminders via email or SMS.


Provide timely educational resources based on care plans or conditions.


Trigger proactive patient follow-ups or provider check-ins, increasing engagement while reducing administrative effort.



Customizable Pipelines for Complex Healthcare Sales Cycles
Healthcare sales processes often require engaging multiple decision makers with distinct timelines, priorities, and evaluation criteria, including clinical directors, CFOs, and IT leaders. HubSpot allows teams to build highly customized pipelines tailored to healthcare scenarios, including patient onboarding, provider engagement, or multi-step payer negotiations.
HubSpot’s custom pipelines enable healthcare sales teams to:

Document interactions with diverse stakeholders, capturing critical information such as care specialties, payer types, and referral sources.


Track sales milestones unique to healthcare, from provider onboarding to complex MedTech implementations.


Automate targeted follow-ups to maintain momentum throughout lengthy sales cycles, ensuring consistent stakeholder engagement without manual overhead.



Healthcare-Specific Reporting and Analytics
HubSpot’s analytics capabilities are designed to provide actionable insights specific to healthcare KPIs—such as patient retention, referral source effectiveness, and marketing campaign ROI. Detailed reports and dashboards help healthcare organizations clearly understand how patient relationships, provider engagements, and outreach strategies contribute to growth and operational efficiency.
With healthcare-specific reporting, teams gain visibility into:

Patient and provider acquisition trends, enabling more targeted marketing and sales strategies.


Referral patterns and provider engagement, empowering teams to optimize referral network management.


Campaign performance across channels, clearly attributing results to individual marketing and sales activities.



Seamless Integrations with Healthcare Systems
HubSpot integrates seamlessly with essential healthcare technology, reducing administrative workload and ensuring data accuracy and compliance. When HubSpot connects to other systems, teams can achieve automated workflows, fewer communication errors, and enhanced compliance across patient interactions.

					Chapter 6
					Integrating HubSpot with Your Healthcare Tech Stack
					HubSpot connects with EHRs, telehealth, billing, and scheduling tools to unify data and automate compliant, AI-powered patient engagement.
				
				
			

			
				
					For healthcare organizations, the effectiveness of a CRM hinges on how smoothly it integrates with existing technologies. HubSpot’s flexibility allows seamless connections with EHRs, telehealth platforms, medical billing systems, and scheduling tools, creating a unified view of patient and provider interactions without the burden of manual data entry.


Connecting HubSpot with Electronic Health Records
EHR systems, such as Athenahealth, Epic, and Meditech, contain essential clinical and administrative patient data. Integration bridges clinical data with marketing, sales, and service, providing consistent, accurate patient information across all teams. 

By integrating HubSpot and your EHR, your organization can:

Automatically synchronize patient demographics, care history, and appointment records, providing marketing and sales teams real-time visibility into patient interactions.


Streamline patient handoffs between clinical and administrative teams, eliminating communication gaps that could negatively impact patient care or compliance.


Ensure consistent, compliant messaging based on accurate clinical data, enhancing both patient experiences and operational efficiency.



Integrating Telehealth Platforms and Patient Portals
Telehealth platforms and patient portals are essential to deliver convenient, ongoing patient engagement. Integrating these technologies into HubSpot extends your visibility into virtual interactions, ensuring seamless patient experiences regardless of care delivery channel. 

With telehealth and patient portal integration, healthcare teams are empowered to:

Capture telehealth session details directly within HubSpot, automatically triggering appropriate follow-ups, educational content, or satisfaction surveys.


Log patient portal interactions in real time, ensuring administrative and clinical staff have a complete picture of patient engagement, appointments, and inquiries.


Personalize outreach based on patient activity within the telehealth platform or patient portal, allowing for more targeted and effective communications.



Integrating Medical Billing and Scheduling Software
Billing and scheduling systems drive critical patient interactions, from appointment reminders to financial follow-ups. By integrating these platforms with HubSpot, healthcare organizations can automate key workflows, reducing manual processes and enhancing patient communication. 

Integration with billing and scheduling software enables your team to:

Automatically update HubSpot records based on appointment confirmations, cancellations, or rescheduling, triggering timely patient communications.

					Why SmartBug Media Is the Leading HubSpot Partner for Healthcare Organizations

					Chapter 9
					Getting Started with HubSpot for Healthcare
					Successful HubSpot implementation in healthcare requires clear goals, tailored setup, team training, ongoing optimization, and expert support.
				
				
			

			
				
					Implementing HubSpot effectively in your healthcare organization requires careful planning, strategic customization, and ongoing optimization to ensure compliance and operational efficiency. A structured process will help your organization successfully adopt HubSpot to enhance patient and provider engagement:
1. Assess Current CRM Gaps
Start by evaluating your current systems to pinpoint specific gaps or inefficiencies in patient and provider relationship management, compliance adherence, and workflow automation. Your assessment should address:

Data management: Are patient and provider records centralized or fragmented across multiple platforms?


Departmental alignment: Do marketing, sales, and service teams have a shared, accurate view of patient and provider interactions?


Manual bottlenecks: Which manual processes consume staff time and could benefit from automation?


Compliance risks: Where are the greatest risks related to managing patient consent, PHI, or regulatory reporting?

This evaluation clarifies how HubSpot can address your organization’s most critical needs.


2. Clearly Define Your Engagement Goals
Based on your gap assessment, define measurable goals for patient and provider engagement. Common healthcare CRM goals include:

Reducing patient no-shows through automated reminders and follow-ups.


Increasing provider referrals by simplifying referral management and communication.


Improving patient adherence with tailored, automated educational resources.


Boosting new patient acquisition and retention rates through targeted, compliant marketing campaigns.

Having clear objectives ensures your HubSpot implementation aligns directly with your organizational priorities.


3. Customize HubSpot for Healthcare Workflows
With clearly defined goals, tailor HubSpot to match your healthcare workflows and compliance requirements. Key customization tasks include:

Creating healthcare-specific contact properties, such as patient status, referral source, payer type, and care plans.


Designing automated workflows for tasks such as appointment scheduling, provider referrals, billing follow-ups, and post-care outreach.


Implementing detailed segmentation for targeted communications based on care plans, provider specialties, or patient demographics.


Setting up secure data management processes, including role-based permissions, audit trails, and consent management.



4. Train Your Teams on Healthcare CRM Best Practices
Effective implementation depends on how well your teams adopt HubSpot’s capabilities. SmartBug recommends comprehensive, role-specific training sessions that address:

Consistent, compliant documentation practices for PHI and patient consent.


Effective use of automation to reduce administrative burden without losing personalization.


Proper tracking of patient and provider interactions to maintain continuity and ensure accurate reporting.


Regular updates and training refreshers to stay current with HubSpot’s latest features, compliance requirements, and industry best practices.



5. Continuously Optimize Your HubSpot Environment
With ongoing updates to HIPAA regulations, expanding telehealth requirements, and growing patient expectations for real-time digital communication, healthcare organizations must regularly adapt their processes. Regular optimization includes:

Periodic performance and compliance audits to proactively identify and address potential gaps or opportunities.


Workflow updates in response to changes in service lines, patient expectations, or provider networks.


Regular training updates for staff as new HubSpot capabilities or regulatory changes emerge.



6. Partner with Healthcare CRM Experts
A successful HubSpot implementation for healthcare requires specialized knowledge and ongoing strategic guidance. Partnering with a healthcare CRM expert, like SmartBug Media, helps ensure your implementation is secure, compliant, and continuously optimized, enabling your team to focus on providing exceptional patient care and service.

This is the privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) for SmartBug Operating LLC (“SmartBug,” “we,” or “our”). We respect your privacy and appreciate the confidence you have placed in SmartBug. We are committed to protecting your privacy and preserving your trust. Please carefully review this Privacy Policy to learn about how we collect, use, and protect any personal information you provide us and your choices for managing your personal information. This Privacy Policy is also subject to the User Agreement.

Information We Collect
SmartBug collects information for a variety of reasons necessary to perform its business operations and when you use our websites, information from our users is collected at several different points on the SmartBug websites. For example, we may collect personally identifiable information from you such as your name, address, phone number, and e-mail address when you register, subscribe to one of our services, download content or participate in other types promotions offered by or through SmartBug, and at other times.
In addition, whenever you visit a website for technical reasons your internet browser automatically transmits information that we collect.  We store some of this information such as your browser type, operating system, IP address, date of access, time of access, URL of the referring website, transferred data volume, retrieved file data, and website usage information, in order to, among other things, evaluate and improve the performance of our websites and to analyze security incidents. 
We do not sell, share, or rent personal information to third parties, and we will not otherwise disclose personally identifiable information to third parties, without your express permission, except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
Why We Collect Your Information
We collect and use information for purposes, such as:

enhancing your experience;
enabling purchases of goods and services;
performing administration and technical support;
marketing communications and promotions;
processing product or offer inquiries;
informing you about special offers;
conducting surveys;
enabling you to enter sweepstakes, contests and other promotions;
creating aggregated information about demographics and usage patterns;
subject to your explicit permission, sharing your information with third parties.

When We Share Your Information
We may use aggregated information to measure general webiste usage patterns and characteristics of our user base, and we may include such aggregated anonymized information about our audience in reports to our commercial vendors. We may also disclose aggregated anonymized user statistics (for example, a certain percentage of our users live in a certain area) in order to describe our audience to existing and prospective advertisers or other third parties. Aggregated anonymized information does not reference names, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, or other personally identifiable information, and it is not traceable to a specific recipient, user e-mail address.
We also may share personal information with companies affiliated with SmartBug. In the event that SmartBug is merged, or in the event of a transfer of our assets, we may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with such transaction. In the event of such a transfer, we will notify you of the change of control of your personal information. You should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to permit your personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without your permission.
From time to time, we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy practices are consistent with ours. For example, we may contract with service providers to provide certain services including credit card processing, data management, promotional services, etc. We provide our service providers with the information needed for them to perform these services. We have a data protection agreement with each individual service provider to keep your information safe.  We use service providers to implement and operate our website for hosting services, programming services, and sales and marketing services.  Each service provider must agree to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of your information in order to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. 
Although unlikely, in certain instances we may disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you or to others. We may also disclose your personal information when we believe the law requires it.
The general registration area can be found on the SmartBug home page and at other locations throughout the website. To use or access certain features of the website, you may have to register or otherwise provide personal information. The decision to provide this information is optional; however, if you elect not to register or provide such information, you may not be able to access certain content or features or participate in various areas of the website.
Utilization and Transfer
To ensure we meet our contractual obligations in providing the Services, we may store, process and forward personal data to our subsidiaries and affiliates and to third parties working on our behalf. 
Security
We use encryption and authentication tools when appropriate to protect the security of personal information that you share with us. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect personal information, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our websites, and you do so at your own risk.
We may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer or use other technology to improve your navigation of our website. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your web browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests, estimate our audience size, track your status in our sweepstakes, contests and promotions and/or analyze your visiting patterns. The use of cookies is an industry standard; you will find them at most major websites. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are using our websites. 
You can generally set your web browser not to accept cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you set your Web browser not to accept cookies, it may affect your ability to utilize all features on the Service.
SmartBug websites may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked websites may be different from our Privacy Policy. You access such linked websites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked website before disclosing any personal information on such site.
Our online chat areas, bulletin boards, other public forums and user-generated content (i.e., photos, videos) can be a useful way for you to express yourself to other online users. When you post messages or otherwise use these features, the information that you provide (including personally identifiable information) may be publicly available to, collected by, and used by third parties. We are not responsible for the content of messages or images posted by users or disclosures of personal information.
Web analytics using pseudonymised user profiles
We use web analytics tools for various purposes on our website. Please note that placing opt-out cookies can only prevent the collection and processing of your data by web analytics tools to a limited extent.
Children’s Privacy
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our records. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.
Privacy Notice for California Residents
This Privacy Notice for California residents applies solely to visitors, users, and others who reside in the State of California (“consumers” or “you”). We adopt this notice to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2019 (“CCPA”) and other California privacy laws.  Any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.

Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights 
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:

The categories of personal information we collected about you.
The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.

You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:

Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
Comply with a legal obligation.
Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

Emailing us at legal@smartbugmedia.com
Visiting https://www.smartbugmedia.com/

Only you or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.  Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.


Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.  If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account.  If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.  For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily usable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
Right to Exercise CCPA Rights
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

Deny you goods or services.
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

                            From start to finish, SmartBug Media was absolutely amazing. We migrated our CRM from Salesforce and had quite a few custom items we wanted built and SmartBug replicated what we were wanting. Our main point of contact, Mike Wolfe, was very professional and knowledgeable about HubSpot and worked very hard to set up our CRM to our expectations and standards.

        Sync and clean data.
As companies grow, data becomes more complex. Without the right tools to manage, synthesize, and analyze that data, you risk missing out on meaningful insights.
With a single, unified CRM platform, we can help you clean and curate customer data with ease, bringing you one step closer to delivering the best results for your customers.
        
      
    
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        Automate and optimize data quality.
Companies’ internal processes must keep up with growing customer demand, or your customers may start shopping around. Let's keep your teams on the cutting edge of efficiency with programmable automation that keeps every business process—from lead rotation to renewals to territory management—running smoothly. 
Additional tools such as workflow extensions and customizable team permissions make it easy to communicate with other team members on a dime, via Slack, Zoom, Asana, or whatever your team uses. 
        
      
    
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        Analyze and draft reports.
Together, we can draw meaningful insights from the customer data collected with robust and comprehensive reporting. By connecting your data to HubSpot’s Snowflake instance, we can leverage that data for your business securely. 
Finally, SmartBug Media can use the custom report builder to produce engaging data visualization reports of all of your marketing and sales efforts on a single dashboard.

What's more, management's transparency and openness to new ideas, customer focus, and flexible working hours won me over!

                            From start to finish, SmartBug Media was absolutely amazing. We migrated our CRM from Salesforce and had quite a few custom items we wanted built and SmartBug replicated what we were wanting. Our main point of contact, Mike Wolfe, was very professional and knowledgeable about HubSpot and worked very hard to set up our CRM to our expectations and standards.

			Most Decorated HubSpot Agency Wins Prestigious Award for Third Time After Expanding Technical Capabilities with Globalia Acquisition

IRVINE, Calif., Feb. 26, 2025 — SmartBug Media® — HubSpot's most decorated Elite Partner in the world and the digital agency of choice for organizations looking to create resilient growth across the entire customer lifecycle — today announced that it has been named HubSpot’s 2024 North American Partner of the Year. This award highlights SmartBug’s continued evolution and leadership within the HubSpot partner ecosystem. SmartBug has been named HubSpot’s Partner of the Year three times in the last seven years. 
SmartBug earned the 2024 North American Partner of the Year award as the top-performing Solutions Partner in the region. HubSpot customers get the most value when they use the entire platform, and SmartBug enables them to do so, bringing expertise across Marketing, Sales, Service, Content and Operations Hub to drive success.
“This achievement underscores our ability to deliver solutions across the entire customer lifecycle and through the entire HubSpot platform,” CEO Ryan Malone said. “Our team demonstrates success working with complex clients across industries to improve their marketing, sales, service and operations — supporting everything from HIPAA-compliant implementations to EHR, ERP and CRM integrations.”
SmartBug has a successful HubSpot partnership history, from being one of the earliest partners to winning the Global HubSpot Partner of the Year award in 2018 to being named one of a select group of Elite Partners. Winning a Partner of the Year award for the third time not only cements the agency as a  HubSpot leader but also sets its legacy as a trusted partner across industries. The world's most decorated HubSpot digital agency has also won 15 HubSpot Impact Awards and more than 200 awards for client work, earned multiple HubSpot Solutions Partner certifications and has served on its North America Partner Advisory Council for several years. 
Angela O’Dowd, VP of the Solutions Partner Program at HubSpot said, “SmartBug has had an incredible impact on their customers’ success. The entire HubSpot community congratulates SmartBug and the other Impact Award winners on this exciting achievement.”
As HubSpot adoption grows, businesses need an agency that can help them unlock the platform’s full potential. Being named Partner of the Year is the cherry on top of a year that saw SmartBug finalize its integration of Globalia, a Canadian marketing agency acquired in 2023, to create one of the world’s largest HubSpot partners.  The combined team brings together deep technical platform expertise and proven strategic consulting, giving businesses both the technical foundation and strategic guidance needed to transform their CRM investment into real results.
“We are starting to see the fruits of our Globalia acquisition as we can combine best-of-breed technical, strategic, and execution capabilities to even the most complex customers — while at the same time creating our own intellectual property in AI and operations to differentiate ourselves in the market and provide lasting customer value,” Malone said.
SmartBug’s expertise spans all HubSpot hubs, enabling robust, personalized solutions for every stage of the customer journey. With eight accreditations, including the newest Content Experience Accreditation, SmartBug offers end-to-end solutions for mid-sized to enterprise-level businesses in equal measure —  backed by deep knowledge and proven success. A team of 19 certified HubSpot trainers equips clients with the tools to optimize the CRM, empowering businesses to achieve measurable results.

When former Shark Tank contestants Nick and Dan approached SmartBug, they were looking for a fresh web redesign to showcase their debt repayment mobile app.
But beyond aesthetics and branding, the Changed team also needed a new site structure to appeal to both B2B and B2C audiences, drive engagement, and boost mobile app downloads. 
Now, post-launch, visitors to the new website are greeted with a modern design, sleek functionality, and messaging specially tailored to attract new prospects.

When it comes to mental health treatment, every missed connection is a missed opportunity to change—or even save—a life. When Potomac Psychiatry struggled to connect with those who needed its services most, the provider partnered with SmartBug Media® to create an empathetic, AI-powered agent that engaged with prospective patients, qualified more leads, increased conversion rates, directly booked new patients, and collected their payments.

Background
Potomac Psychiatry specializes in addressing the root causes of emotional and psychological issues through its personalized, science-based approach called Root Cause Psychiatry™. Led by Bruce Alan Kehr, MD, the national award-winning practice has provided comprehensive mental healthcare services for more than four decades.

















  
    
    
      
        
        
          
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Problem
Missed Opportunities to Connect with Patients in Need of Mental Healthcare Services
Potomac Psychiatry encountered challenges in reaching and converting qualified digital leads, hindering their ability to reach more patients who needed their Root Cause Psychiatry services. Despite enjoying a fruitful collaboration on inbound content, they realized that their technical blog articles—while validating the practice’s thought leadership—were too advanced for the intended audience to understand and were not generating leads.
What was missing was the connection between how this thought leadership would translate into superior patient care and result in better, faster recovery at less cost. This left potential patients without an understanding of how the practice’s specialized expertise would solve their unique challenges.
Recognizing this issue, Potomac Psychiatry turned to AI as a solution to offer more personalized and empathetic interactions. Motivated by a strong desire to improve mental health outcomes, Bruce Alan Kehr, MD believed AI could deliver the timely and unique responses necessary to build trust and guide patients toward the care they need. After thoroughly evaluating potential partners, he chose SmartBug Media, drawn by our consultative approach and deep AI expertise.
        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  


















	
    
    
      
      What particularly impressed me was SmartBug Canada’s extensive background in AI, how long they’d been doing it, and the other projects they’ve worked on ... They didn’t pitch generic recommendations, but very specific, tactical ones that aligned with our goals and vision.

Our Solution
Building Trust and Increasing Lead Conversions with a HIPAA-Compliant AI Agent Integrated into HubSpot

SmartBug developed Dr. Holo, an AI-powered chatbot, to foster trust and build connections with potential Potomac Psychiatry patients.
Dr. Holo provides relevant information and qualifies leads through targeted questions and customized, curated answers to guide potential patients toward appropriate care.
Built with GPT-4, the HIPAA-compliant chatbot integrates with HubSpot, improving lead generation while ensuring patient-centered care.

 


To address Potomac Psychiatry's challenges, SmartBug kickstarted a custom project to develop Dr. Holo—an AI-powered agent designed to foster trust and establish connections from the outset. Named after the Greek word ""holos,"" meaning holistic, Dr. Holo embodies Potomac Psychiatry’s commitment to a comprehensive, root-cause approach to mental health.
Featured prominently on the homepage, Dr. Holo’s dual purpose is clear: to provide potential patients with timely, relevant information while qualifying leads through targeted questions and uniquely personal conversations. This approach ensures users receive the right content at the right moment, based upon situation and empathy-mapping their condition, guiding them toward the care they need. 
SmartBug Canada’s AI solutions team utilized three different large language models (LLMs) to create an agent capable of engaging patients in a sensitive and empathetic manner. They established clear guidelines, undertook rigorous training with curated scientific information and information from the Potomac Psychiatry website, and conducted extensive testing to ensure potential patients would receive accurate and helpful responses (all using HIPAA-compliant procedures) → Learn More About SmartBug's HIPAA Compliance
















The Results
From AI-Powered Communication to Conversion: Turning Warm Conversations into Qualified Leads
















Deploying Dr. Holo at Potomac Psychiatry has been a significant commercial and branding success. Acting as a warm and welcoming virtual doctor, the AI agent provides relevant information while efficiently guiding users through the sales flywheel and converting them into qualified leads. From there, the integration enables the agent to automatically book an appointment with a specific doctor and take payment for that first appointment.
Since its launch, Dr. Holo has surpassed previous lead generation strategies by building relationships and advancing patients through the care process. The data is compelling:

Potomac Psychiatry has seen substantial improvements across all key sales and marketing metrics. There has also been a 24% increase in connection possibility with potential patients—meaning Potomac Psychiatry’s team has a better chance of coming in contact with anyone who becomes a lead.
This project has delivered impressive business results and aligned seamlessly with Potomac Psychiatry’s mission to reach more patients in need. Building on this success, Potomac Psychiatry and SmartBug developed a decision-making support tool for mental health clinicians. Leveraging the development work that created Dr. Holo, this tool assists clinicians in overcoming the treatment resistance that characterizes many of their patients by providing tailored, data-driven insights that guide more effective patient care strategies.
By integrating this innovative tool into its practice, Potomac Psychiatry—with SmartBug on deck as a trusted partner—continues to push the boundaries of how technology can enhance mental health treatment, further solidifying its commitment to offering holistic care to patients in need.

















	
    
    
      
      With Dr. Holo, you're getting an entire suite of specialists on your team to support your mental health, benefiting from the work of countless scientists ... This isn't just a one-on-one transaction; we're transforming mental health delivery with an advanced decision support system. Unlike the typical practice, where patients receive standard advice, here you get curated insights based on research that would take a thousand lifetimes for any psychiatrist to read. 

Dr. Holo brings the benefit of hundreds of thousands of scientific articles tailored to each patient’s specific needs ... The decision support tool results are so compelling in helping our patients that we have featured them in a series of blogs on the Potomac Psychiatry website. We plan to license Dr. Holo to other behavioral health practices to help them achieve better clinical outcomes along with higher rates of return on their marketing spend.

        How much does Senior Living CRM cost?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Senior Living CRM is a purpose-built configuration of HubSpot, designed specifically for senior living communities.
The costs break down into two areas:

Implementation: Starting at $4,500
HubSpot Software: This depends on the number of users and needed features (marketing, sales, occupancy management, etc)

HubSpot is competitively priced against other senior living CRMs. We are happy to provide a recommendation on what functionality would benefit your team the most but feel free to explore HubSpot Software pricing on your own if you’d find that helpful.
    
    
    
      
        How do I effectively integrate AI into the Senior Living CRM?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      With HubSpot, it's easy to integrate AI technology into your day-to-day workflows. HubSpot allows you to leverage AI across your Marketing, Sales, and Service Hub in your new Senior Living CRM so you can work more efficiently across teams and with prospective residents.

        How long does it take to get fully set-up in the Senior Living CRM?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      You can expect a minimum of 4-8 weeks to get Senior Living CRM configured for your team.

The timeline for implementation depends on the number of hubs we are implementing, the number of team members we are training, the number of systems we are building in HubSpot, and the number of integrations we are connecting to HubSpot.
    
    
    
      
        My team is new to HubSpot. Do you offer training?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Yes! As part of the initial onboarding and setup, our team of HubSpot experts will also conduct a training session to familiarize your team with HubSpot. Once your integration is complete, we offer ongoing support as a chance to answer questions, troubleshoot any concerns, and identify other opportunities for optimization. 
    
    
    
      
        Can the Senior Living CRM be customized to our business?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Absolutely! We understand that your HubSpot requirements may be unique, based on the needs of your communities. HubSpot's CRM offers extensive customization for users to:

Map your specific data onto the CRM

Configure layouts to suit your team's needs
Maximize your CRM functionality with a variety of extensions and APIs

    
    
    
      
        Does the Senior Living CRM integrate with other third-party tools?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Yes! HubSpot offers hundreds of pre-built integrations with the most common marketing, sales, and support tools. HubSpot also has a developer-friendly set of APIs that we can help connect your tools through custom integrations if needed.

    
    
    
      
        How does HubSpot support HIPAA compliance?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      HubSpot supports HIPAA compliance by offering robust security and privacy protections. This includes audit logging, advanced authentication features, properties to store protected health information (PHI), and more.

            Smartbug has been a pleasure to work with. I really feel like they are an extension of my team. We've used them for graphic design, content strategy, content creation (both short and long-form), HubSpot consulting, and website/landing page design. We were very close to using them for PR and Ads as well but ultimately ended up hiring those in-house. I have recommended Smartbug to multiple people already. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again in future organizations.

            Smartbug has been integral in getting our inbound marketing efforts off the ground. We had few internal resources, and Smartbug not only built our program but is pushing us forward at a higher speed than we could have ever anticipated. They are self-driven, organized, and true partners for all things related to Marketing, Ops, and PR.

			I've worked with SmartBug on multiple projects, from building a completely new website for my company to one-off microsites for special projects. Everyone has been easy to work with, they have a very clear communication style, are deadline-oriented, and most importantly, deliver excellent results that I am proud of. I can't recommend them highly enough. Two big thumbs up for SmartBug!

			The team at SmartBug was phenomenal from the quotation and project scope process all the way through the completion and integration of the final web site. What impressed us the most about SmartBug was the limited amount of time required for them to understand our message. If there was any language or messaging that needed clarification, they processed the feedback from us quickly and implemented the changes in efficient fashion. The project scope and updates were diligently supplied to us and we completed our web site on time per their original project schedule.

			It has only been a few months but their knowledge of inbound marketing has been one of the best resources we could have asked for. We are in the very niche industry of insurance tech and their ability to adapt surprised me. Our dedicated strategist, Molly, has been exceptional. Working with her and her team has honestly felt like a partnership. They have designed an inbound strategy for us and great content to match it. They have also helped with optimizing our existing content. I would recommend SmartBug to anyone who needs help with inbound marketing.

			I cannot even begin to share the positive experiences I have had with the SmartBug team! We tell them our desired end result and they work with us every step of the way to help us get there. Crafting and customizing plans for each unique situation. They are great stewards of our resources and help us understand the ""complexity"" of their world in ways that makes sense to me. They are super responsive, friendly and a great team to work with. I would recommend SmartBug and their team of amazing people to anyone who is looking to take their digital marketing to the next level.

Jessica and Chelsea are rock stars! They provide us with insights and ideas that are essential to the success of our content strategy and operations. Their guidance and expertise has given us the direction we needed to enhance our presence and develop a better relationship with our audience.

			We started working with SmartBug 6 months ago. In that short amount of time we were able to completely revitalize our marketing efforts and make our small marketing department appear much larger that it actually is. SmartBug taught us new marketing strategies that we could put into effect immediately. Our team at SmartBug has been engaging and supportive. They took the time to really understand our business and our initiatives and put together a plan that fit with our company's mission and values. I highly recommend this company!

			SmartBug is an agency full of experts without all the ego. Our dedicated strategists are always thinking 5-10 steps ahead and very communicative about each task they execute. It's not just about getting it done – they also teach us why we should be doing it a certain way. If you decide to go with SmartBug, you won't be disappointed. We've worked with other marketing agencies before where we've gotten lost amongst other clients and sometimes had to wait a few days before getting an email response or were frequently told ""no"" because we didn't have enough points/we were way past the editing phase of the project. However, from the very beginning of our partnership with SmartBug, every single SmartBug employee we've worked with has been very communicative and eager to help (we've never heard ""no""). Needless to say, we are continuing our partnership with them!

			My healthcare company has been working with SmartBug for a little over a year now, and to think of where we started to where we are now is shocking. We engaged SmartBug for a full website build and transition to HubSpot as well as a comprehensive inbound campaign and PPC. Any one of these tasks is a huge projects alone, but SmartBug handled them all simultaneously with ease. And, most impressively, delivered on every campaign with metrics to back up the success. We've grown over 250% this last year and the growth curve is still ramping. SmartBug provides us with a complete marketing toolkit. My account manager acts as a central line of communication whatever the campaign needs: copy writer, development, strategy, PPC specialist, graphics... the list goes on an on. For companies with limited resources, SmartBug is your all-in-one marketing department. For companies with extensive resources, SmartBug is your strategic partner to maximize spend and ensure success.

			We've worked with SmartBug now for almost a year. I was new to my marketing role at this organization and HubSpot prior to engaging with SmartBug. Quickly I realized we did not have our systems configured to optimize all the potential HubSpot could offer to our organization. We worked with SmartBug to reconfigure our properties, establish lead flow systems & strategies and ultimately implement workflows to encourage more donations while better engaging our target donor personas. The team was very strategic, understood our mission and was a lot of fun to work with. We have increased new donors and new subscribers quickly because of our work with SmartBug.

I was blown away by how much of an impact the company has had on our organization--through its systems, we've been able to reach more prospective donors and turn them into actual donors. We worked closely with the team to put systems in place that resulted in more donors with less day-to-day work. We all really enjoyed working with the SmartBug team

Since we started we have doubled the resources we have from SmartBug and completed a complete website rebuild. To date we are more than 200% up year on year for our key metrics ans super excited to continue our work with SmartBug.

			As a start-up health technology company, every penny of marketing investment must demonstrate clear value and return-on-investment. SmartBug helped us crystalize our focus, set-up and optimize HubSpot, and provide rich, relevant content to usher our clients through the buying process. SmartBug helped us position our company and product in the digital world ""as a must consider"" entry in a competitive segment. Specifically, they helped us establish our company as a trusted source of product and category information, enabled prospects to access the right information they needed, and allowed us to leverage limited staff into the sales process at the right time. Our account team was talented, timely and professional and the content team consistently generated high-value content that hit the mark with our buyer personas. SmartBug's process optimized our time to assure clarity, speed, and quality. After working with SmartBug before, we had high expectations -- and they exceeded them!

From start to finish, they demonstrated superior knowledge about inbound marketing and the HubSpot CMS and guided us to where we needed to be. SmartBug listened, interpreted and adapted our brand into an amazing site that tells our story. As a start-up, launching our brand is critical and the website does an exemplary job. Our PM, Aaron Riddle, was diligent, focused and super knowledgeable on what we needed, how to leverage HubSpot and incorporate. As the Founder and CEO of my company, Aaron knew how to prioritize and keep us on task. The entire team has been outstanding and the product they have delivered is the same!

The entire team was focused on helping us build a modern site that helps guide potential customers through clear messaging of our products and services. They listened. They really took the time to understand what we needed and how we wanted to grow our business. They offered a great strategy for the communication and flow of our pages and were able articulate their suggestions so we could visualize what our customers would experience. The team was on target with communication and meeting deadlines. The end result was fantastic. Our website now gets a score of 97 on website grader. Visitors are viewing more pages and staying longer. Leads are better. Team members Jen, Kyle, Hasan, Ben, Amanda and the rest of the crew were great to work with. We'd work with them again in a heartbeat.

			SmartBug has been instrumental in rocketing our company's marketing approach forward into the 21st century. They came on board during a major shift in strategy and have been there to help with both the baby steps and the giant leaps forward. Working with our account managers Drew and Ken has been like bringing two super heros on board the team. I am consistently impressed by their intelligence, professionalism, patience, creativity, and care. They are generous with their time and knowledge, equally willing to jump in and brainstorm with us, to pick apart analytics, answer questions, and of course, execute on deliverables. In the past our CEO has been skeptical of external agencies that try to apply a prefab, one-size-fits-all approach to complex issues. That has absolutely not been our experience with SmartBug. And indeed, he has been so impressed by the partnership, he’s touted it as a model to other departments. They’ve set a high bar!

			As you have read the reviews, you are quite aware that everyone loves the team they work with. Did you know they are rock stars at content? As in light stage on fire with pyrotechnics and throw televisions out of hotels kind of rocking it. When they are not being the perfect band to hang with, the content they do create is amazing and can change the way your company embraces your ideal customers. Here are three reasons why you should rock with them: 1. The team at Smartbug works with you to not just find your audience but really get to know who they are and what they want. You can't rock without a crowd. 2. They groove and riff creating the best content there is. Trust them, it is their job and they'll leave you wanting more. 3. No reunion tours needed; what you sign up for is better than what you can ever imagine you are going to get and they will not leave you hanging. Are you ready to rock it now?!? Come on [Insert Your City/Business], let's rock!

SmartBug researched and architected the personas, relevant pain, messaging, and general approach to Conversica's targeting plan. SmartBug is a dependable team of marketing ninja's who deliver at the highest level. I would highly recommend engaging with their team.

The entire experience was effortless, as every member of their team that I worked with made it easy and enjoyable, from sales all the way through launch. I was beyond impressed with their expertise. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a HubSpot partner.

I trust them and feel comfortable having them do creative and development work on any project for our startup. The work they do is precise, eloquent, quick, and master class. They know HubSpot intimately and have achieved the impossible on multiple occasions for us. As a UX/UI Designer, I depend heavily on developers who follow designs to the pixel and SmartBug does just that. They launched our corporate site in record time and treated our product like it was their product. Patricia, Tessa, Evan, Ben, Jen, and Ryan — you’re all incredible in your disciplines and you’ve made us a better company because of your work. Thank you for all you’ve done and will continue to do. I can’t say enough good things and will always feel extraordinary confidence in rehiring all of you again.

SmartBug was the perfect blend of a knowledgeable business with the experience in HubSpot to help us to execute a website that not only looked great but was designed to optimize conversions. The team at SmartBug was very easy to work with and brought a level of organization to our complex project that was a breath of fresh air. We are delighted with our experience in using SmartBug and look forward to seeing how we can use them again in the future.

			When we were looking to truly start harnessing the power of inbound by adding HubSpot we chose SmartBug as our partner to make sure our onboarding was successful. We weren't completely convinced that we needed an agency as part of our long-term solution; we wanted to avoid ridiculous agency fees and based on our past experiences felt that there wasn't an agency that could about our business as much as we did. Well over a year later, I think of SmartBug as my daily hero and recognize that the level of detail, innovation, and forward thinking they provide allows me to focus on constantly improving our overall marketing strategy and improving internal processes. Additionally, we have never felt gouged by the fees - when budget has nearly prevented us from taking steps we have been able to work with our SmartBug team to come up with creative solutions. That's a true partner.

			SmartBug were incredibly in tune with our needs and very adaptable. They lent their expertise where we had gaps - without pushing in - which made for a very complementary relationship. This way, they handled the technical development of our entire website, blog and partner directory. They also provided strategic guidance on more advanced things like leveraging content clusters. More importantly, SmartBug executed the work in record time and the quality of delivery was so on-point that we haven’t needed to use a single round of revision - okay, maybe a couple tiny adjustments. In short, SmartBug is a responsive, dependable and expert partner who provides excellent value for money. I recommend them without any hesitation.

			From my very first interaction with SmartBug, they sought to understand our goals and get to the heart of what matters most to us. Throughout our time working together, they’ve continued this practice - before making recommendations, they listen first. Just as important, SmartBug doesn’t tell us what we want to hear. They talk straight and tell us what we need to hear, even if it means turning away potential business from us. Having a partner who we can trust to put our interests first and give us honest advice is invaluable. Unlike a vendor who’s trying to sell us something, SmartBug operates as part of our team. Finally, SmartBug does what they say they are going to and they deliver results. They keep projects moving according to schedule, proactively communicate with us and consistently exceed our expectations.

			Listen, I know inbound marketing. I know design. I understand lead nurturing. I get the importance of content. So, to impress me -- and get a 5-star rating -- you have to astound me with a service that is beyond my expectations. AND, SmartBug has consistently done that ... over and over. They live customer service. They understand responsiveness. AND, they listen -- a trait rarely seen these days. But more than that, they take our needs, wants and concerns and couple that with thoughtful analytics and data gathering. When presenting a solution, they consistency are spot on. True experts in their field. Equally important, they're fun, relatable and just simply good people. Why would I want to work anyone who's not the best? Where do I give 6-stars?

			There may well be an alien civilization out there that has a better HubSpot and Marketing partner; however, if you're stuck here on planet Earth with me this should be your top choice. SmartBug is the premier HubSpot partner and I now understand why. Their deep connection to the HubSpot team and astounding knowledge of both the CMS and CRM parts of the product make the difficult look easy. Couple that with an amazing team of knowledgeable inbound marketing guru's and you have an entire marketing department at your fingertips for a reasonable fee. Probably most importantly though is the great people they have. Tools and tactics are important, but what makes a company great to work with is great people and SmartBug has those in droves. Give them a call!

			SmartBug was an amazing partner for us. They came in and worked with me to transform my entire inbound marketing strategy and helped us build a pipeline funnel along with a strategic approach to nurture and qualify leads. I ultimately had them managing my web experience as I had moved everything from wordpress over to hubspot. The GDD team consistently exceeded my expectations and brought recommendations that improved the experience and drove better quality traffic to the correct areas on the pages. I also used the team for paid search / ads and the team drove triple digit increases in traffic and conversions of traffic for us while garnering better ROI than we were doing on our own. After a year of working with SmartBug, I highly recommend them to anyone as their services have really paid off for us.

			I can't say how pleased I am with SmartBug! Being the marketing manager—in a marketing department that only consists of myself—finding an outsource partner to work with is crucial to not just my company's success, but my success as well. We have unsuccessfully worked with a few other HubSpot partners, which resulted in frustration, disappointment, and a lot of lost time. SmartBug is completely the opposite. They don't miss deadlines, they have fantastic project management, their entire team is great, they are totally on top of everything so I don't have to be, their writing is so top-notch, and all of their design work is just beautiful. I am also ecstatic about their ability to strategize and their level of expertise they bring, and not just with HubSpot best practices, but with marketing in general. Oh, it's so sweet, it is like cheating (shhh, don't tell my boss).

			I love SmartBug! While considering CRM options, we got serious about HubSpot, and the partnership with SmartBug Media was a natural fit. Their team enthusiastically took on a very technical industry with niche service offerings and turned the exploratory process into one that was both enlightening and eye-opening for all involved. We very much appreciate the attention to detail, the prompt response to our needs, and the overall positive work ethic from entire SB team. Jessica has gone above and beyond to ensure client satisfaction, and we are very grateful. Our company is very proud of the results of the collaborative work between SmartBug and our in-house team. SmartBug has helped us immensely to date, and I can't wait to see what the future holds as we continue to evaluate the ROI. Thanks so much for introducing us to inbound!

			After being in business for 17+ years, we thought it was time to get serious about marketing. We first found HubSpot, then we found SmartBug … and are thankful that we partnered with both! In determining who we'd choose as our partners for providing us with a new website and helping us develop our marketing strategy, several key factors were considered: track record, ROI, and customer service. In talking with SmartBug's owner, Ryan Malone, one thing was clear—CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS THEIR MAIN FOCUS, and they have not let us down. SmartBug has a staff of hardworking content producers, web developers, and managers who are taking our business to the next level. We are SO THANKFUL that we found them and they continue to support us in our inbound endeavors!

			Everyone talks about being a ""partner"" with their clients these days, but in my experience, I have found this to largely be just ""sales speak."" What a refreshing and inspiring find it was when we discovered Ryan Malone and his team of unparalleled inbound experts. Rachel, Lexie, and the entire team at SmartBug have quickly become a part of our family and developed a deep understanding of why we exist, how we are striving to achieve our mission/vision, and what exactly we do. Their unparalleled expertise in HubSpot, inbound practices, and marketing in general, combined with countless examples of always going the extra mile and delivering real results, has made them a trusted advisor resource unlike any other we have experienced. Selfishly, I would rather keep them all to myself, but if you want an inspiring experience with a ""true partner"" that gets it, give SmartBug a call.

			SmartBug Media has done an amazing job on our website. We are an insurance brokerage in Canada. Our industry is extremely competitive in the online world. Ryan's team has been able to really help us get on the map for insurance in our area. In the first month, we have tripled the amount of viewers and quotes that we have received from our website. They are in it for the long-term relationship. Ryan is very flexible with how we need his team’s help. Insurance is a very technical industry, and we are making it our mission to simplify insurance for the everyday consumer. They have really helped us achieve this goal. We did our homework prior to signing with SmartBug, and they won over their competitors because of their flexibility in work and their competitive pricing.

I could not have asked for a better partner.

			Senior Solutions Management Group has been a customer of HubSpot for several years. Having personally gone through HubSpot's Inbound Marketing University, I was very familiar with power of HubSpot and what it has brought to our organization. Time became a real issue for us, and we wanted to focus on our core business of senior housing. We contracted with SmartBug Media to manage our inbound marketing strategy and build on the success we had already enjoyed with Hubspot. Ryan and his team took command of our inbound and took us to the next level. Our communities currently enjoy stable occupancy rates of 99%+. SmartBug is an integral part of our success.

			Quantex Laboratories has had a web presence since 1995. We've worked with a number of website developers. A few months back, we made a decision to use HubSpot for inbound marketing of our new site. After a false start, we contacted SmartBug Media and explained our need and time constraints. Ryan and his associates immediately understood what our project entailed. They put a proposal together and executed it flawlessly. Their customer support and service was absolutely phenomenal! When we needed changes or modifications or the addition of features, they got it done! What else can I say—we highly recommend SmartBug Media.

Not only was the creative work outstanding, but the knowledge and understanding that SmartBug Media has of the HubSpot platform is superior to any other service provider that we contacted. Ryan and his team were incredibly responsive and prompt—meeting a pretty tight deadline for our product. After the designs were completed and implemented into HubSpot, Ryan and his team provided us with excellent hands-on training for our team. HIGHLY RECOMMEND. In fact, we are already working with SmartBug Media on our next project!

Plus, through their keyword research they have helped us uncover new phrases that are helping our overall site to rise in search rankings. Give them a call - it'll be well worth your time.

SmartBug knows exactly what HubSpot can do and pushes the platform to perform for our business.

			We worked SmartBug to develop a new version of our website completely on HubSpot COS, with a new company name, and a completely new look and feel. The end result was great (www.answerdash.com), came in on time and on budget. The creative and marketing work and execution were all top-notch. As we waded into the project, we had several changes along the way, and SmartBug was always very responsive to requests we made. During crunch time, as we got closer to a press event, Ryan and team were always on top of things, kept us informed, and delivered what we needed when we needed it. We would gladly use them again for any HubSpot-related projects.

The content they’ve created for us include numerous emails, blog posts, whitepapers, and e-books that not only drive the traffic we need to our site, but is driving the right audience.

Being a newbie to HubSpot, I took the advice of SmartBug that HubSpot was a must-have! Since our launch, month after month I am amazed at the capabilities of the SmartBug Media team and the functionality of HubSpot. Their copywriters and blogging team are very educated in a variety of industries and are able to produce impressive content. SmartBug knows their stuff, that’s for sure, and their proactive approach to our inbound plan has been perfect for our growing technology startup. SmartBug delivers on time and is quick to make the adjustments needed to keep moving forward to success. Thanks SmartBug!

We've used a variety of their services—content strategy development, web design and development on HubSpot COS, blog content writing, premium content creation, social media—and the results have exceeded our expectations. Last but certainly not least, the team is a pleasure to work with. Ryan has built a fantastic team, and I highly recommend them to any organization.

Thanks to Ryan and the rest of the SmartBug team, I am a true believer. Because of their professionalism, there are never any surprises, other than stellar results.

I have been a CMO for a $4B+ NYSE-listed firm prior to starting my own company, and I have been very fortunate to have met the SmartBug team. They are troopers and work as partners in solving problems. Their work ethics are par none, and their delivery quality is best practice material. We struggled with using HubSpot's features to our advantage until the SmartBug team came in, and now we look entirely different. Kudos to these guys, and they have my strong thumbs-up for anyone considering working with them.

As a team, we have developed an incremental plan to get where we are today. They are a valued partner and tirelessly work to make us live up to our full potential.

Too often, marketer companies talk a big game only to waste your time. This is not the case with SmartBug. Any issue we've had they have quickly corrected and are always ensuring they are adding value to our bottom line. We look for ROI, not ""views"" or ""likes,"" and SmartBug gets this. If you are looking for an extension of your marketing team or you even want them to be your marketing team, you should give them a call.

			With a recent investment in marketing automation, our team was very excited about launching effective inbound marketing capabilities. It quickly became clear that if we really wanted to maximize our HubSpot investment and optimize our return on investment, we would need some assistance learning the new paradigm and training our team to shift our mindset around lead generation. SmartBug emerged as our trusted guide to help us design, implement, and measure our program's success. In hindsight, I can honestly say I know we would not have gotten the same incredible results without them. They helped us deliver early wins that created momentum in the change management of our marketing and sales teams. The SmartBug leadership and team are passionate and really fun to work with. They have earned that elusive ""partner"" status with members of our team. Now that you have marketing automation tools in place, optimize your program with a team that can help you reach your goals.

They are extremely responsible and are willing to listen to any ideas and suggestions that I have to offer, and although they are certainly more knowledgeable about inbound marketing than I am, they have always treated me as their equal.

			I was in a bind and needed a basic site up and running in a week while I waited for a website developer to deliver a project that was already a month late. Two days later, I let the other developer go and I'm moving forward with the Inbound Performance templates. The templates are very easy to use. Ryan has been great. It's always a pleasure to work with someone who is genuinely concerned about the experience of his customers.

			We needed a new microsite designed and built in time for the launch of a new product. As is so often the case, circumstances caused the project to get started much later than planned, and we weren't sure we could get it done on time. SmartMedia's Ryan responded quickly, understood our predicament, and told us exactly what they could do for us in the time we had. We took the risk, put our project in their hands, and they pulled it off without a hitch. Two things stand out for me. First, Ryan didn't waste any time spinning a canned sales pitch. It was refreshing to talk to someone who is so matter-of-fact and gets right to business. Second, the team assigned to the project ran it like clockwork. We got a detailed schedule, updates at every step, and reminders when we needed to provide something to keep the project moving. Just what every busy marketer needs—someone else keeping things on track. Bottom line? They did a great job and I'd use them again. Recommended.

			If only I knew of SmartBug Media before. I hired a different HubSpot marketing agency to build our initial website template with the expectation that we would be able to expand upon it without the need to code websites. I was disappointed. A year-and-a-half later, I had a stagnant website that I couldn't make changes to without paying the original agency. I initially contacted SmartBug to get a quote to rebuild our entire website. They came back with an even better solution: a template that allowed us to build our site exactly the way we wanted it on our own time. An extra bonus is that the template had enough pages to give us most of the bells and whistles our marketing department wanted right out of the box! Thanks SmartBug!

We're seeing great results, and we highly recommend them!

			As a non-graphic designer, non-developer, I needed a better-looking homepage and blog than the default HubSpot templates were offering me. So I went to the HubSpot Template Marketplace thinking it would be an easy plug-and-play, just buy this template for this page and this template for that page. I quickly realized that this wouldn't be the case, as each had a different CSS stylesheet assigned to it, which affects the header and footer and look and feel of all pages. That was my own fault, although I do feel like that's how it should work. At any rate, I explained my confusion to SmartBug, and at no additional cost, they made it so that I could use the same CSS stylesheet across their templates and the HubSpot default templates. Yay! They also custom-designed a new homepage for me, at a very reasonable price. I basically said, ""Make it look like this page""—a company that provides a similar service—and they delivered it very quickly. Thanks SmartBug!

			The team at SmartBug was a tremendous help in our complete website overhaul and migration over to the HubSpot system from Blackbaud's NetCommunity. Ryan, Founder and CEO, personally helped walk us through some of the steps before we started and helped alleviate some of the concerns our nonprofit organization had. Emily and her team did an amazing job redesigning our site and taking our needs for certain pages and bringing them to life. The team helped us complete the migration, setup, and training in a tight deadline that we needed it completed in. They made things simple for us (non-website technically oriented people) to understand, and the process went smoothly. I would definitely recommend SmartBug to others and intend to use them in the future for other projects.

			If you are working within HubSpot, SmartBug has the people and know-how to build your website. I've thrown them real, hard web challenges, and they responded with, ""Yup, we can do it."" Not only have they accomplished this, they worked fast. Ryan and team were very responsive to my needs. Not many design firms can be as responsive as they have been. If you are shopping for a design firm, consider them first.

			We are private golf club established in 1920 located in Southern California. I mention our est. date to reinforce our ""old school"" roots—suffice it to say that ""marketing"" is not conventionally a core competency of most private clubs (ourselves included). As a member of our Board of Directors, I inherited the newly established ""Marketing Committee"" and felt inbound was the only sensible approach for our type of enterprise. The choice of HubSpot as the underlying platform was an easy one, but we felt the key ingredient would be finding the right enablement partner. We selected SmartBugMedia after a thorough review, and suffice it to say that Ryan and team have more than met our expectations. SmartBug is an exceptional team of professionals with both breadth and depth. They excel both at strategy as well as execution—a rare combination in most consulting organizations. I credit this distinction to Ryan's leadership and focus, which in turn transcends throughout his team.

			SmartBug created our HubSpot email templates for us—quickly and well. We are now using them for a whole range of other HubSpot projects and remain very satisfied. One of the biggest worries of working with a new agency is that what you request and what is delivered are not always the same; however, with SmartBug the delivery was exactly as it was explained from the get-go. Not only is the quality of work great, but we really enjoy working with the team as well! This team knows their stuff!

			Ryan and the whole SmartBug team were fantastic to work with. They built several different email templates and two templates for our blog that we just relaunched. The pieces they delivered completely aligned with the designs we provided, and Ryan recommended best practices along the way. They also managed to meet what I would call an extremely tight deadline, maintaining a high standard of work, as well as providing clear and consistent communication along the way. I would not hesitate to recommend working with SmartBug, and we already have a few other projects we're planning on sending their way. Definitely one of the best agencies I've ever worked with.

			We originally brought SmartBug in to help us ramp up our inbound content efforts. We had been utilizing HubSpot for about nine months but needed help to take our content strategy to the next level, as well as maximizing the value of HubSpot. We have a very complex B2B product and highly specific target market, and we were blown away by how quickly Ryan, Amber, and team understood our current state, created a practical and impactful plan and then help us execute it. As noted by another reviewer below: ""They excel both at strategy as well as execution—a rare combination in most consulting organizations."" I consider them a true partner in our marketing efforts and would highly recommend them to any size organizations, whether a startup or an enterprise organization.

			I've been very pleased with SmartBug's overall service. I've worked with a number of content and PR agencies on content marketing, and SmartBug’s strategy and execution are the best I've experienced—good enough that I've brought them with me into other companies. We are a B2B software company serving manufacturers. They've been able to work with our subject matter experts to create content that works and gets us noticed. I'm looking forward to a continued fruitful relationship.

			Working with the SmartBug team has been truly enjoyable. Their level of professionalism and adaptability to meet our needs in impressive. Their intuitiveness in bringing our corporate voice to life in the content development and ideas to differentiate A-WIN Insurance from our competitors is remarkable. Only six weeks into our new website launch and we are already hitting our one-year targets in lead generation and marketing results. We have really appreciated their flexibility in program and support design to meet our needs. Great team.

			Why SmartBug? That is the question that every President or CEO will ask when the time comes to make a decision on the right marketing partner for their business. There are many reasons to choose SmartBug. They are an extremely talented group with the highest level of expertise. They always deliver, and they do so with a consistently high quality that I have not experienced with any other team. They can be trusted. In my 20 years of marketing, both as an individual contributor and now as a leader, I have never experienced the level of professionalism, execution, and understanding that we have experienced with SmartBug. Every member of the team has invested the time necessary to understand the culture and voice of Keystone Technologies. They deliver amazing content, and they do so at a pace and volume that is remarkable. Ryan Malone has built a wonderful company that I recommend without hesitation. Not only is SmartBug our partner, they are our trusted friends.

			Our team has been working with the Smartbug team for over two years, and the results have been nothing short of successful. The team truly understands our business, how we use inbound, and where it fits into our overall marketing strategy. Their services don’t stop at content development, social media, web design, and blog writing—they’re truly available to act as consultants and extensions of our team. Additionally, everyone I have interacted with is extremely professional and understanding to our needs. Priorities are constantly changing on our end, yet they react with incredible flexibility and responsiveness. I would strongly recommend partnering with Smartbug for your needs as you won’t be anything short of delighted!

			Huge thanks to Ryan, Ben, and the entire SmartBug team. A more responsive, supportive, and friendly partner you will not find. We did our homework before choosing SmartBug and can say they're absolutely competitive in terms of pricing (more than competitive), but without comparison in terms of ease of working with. We rebuilt our website, choosing to go with their marketplace templates. We then retained them to semi-customize. We were just starting to drink the HubSpot Kool-Aid and learning inbound ... and the SmartBug team was there riding shotgun with us the whole way, coaching us on everything from designing CTAs to blogging best practices. Everyone there was extremely responsive to our requests, their work quality is high, and they always over-deliver. We will definitely retain them for future work, I have no doubt. Thanks again, SmartBug!

			SmartBug's web templates were exactly what we were looking for to enhance our Inbound marketing strategy!

I would recommend and will definitely look them up again for assistance with future projects.

			As the owner of a small business startup, I was looking for a reasonably priced solution to help me build my website. I purchased the SmartBug Performance template pack, and I have to say that I was very impressed. I found there to be any excellent array of webpages from which I was able to build an entirely comprehensive and functional website. The few times I needed support, HubSpot was quite friendly and supportive. I am very grateful for their product and the quality of service I have received.

			SmartBug is the best partner you could ever ask for. They take the time to understand your business and goals and then craft a unique strategic program that utilizes the inbound marketing and web design tactics they’ve developed and perfected over time. From a management and execution standpoint, they are always on time and produce incredible, award-winning work. And just when you thought they couldn't get any better, they engage their analytic chops to evolve and improve the effectiveness of your program. It all boils down to people: Ryan Malone is the consummate professional and is someone you can trust. And he has assembled a team of the most talented marketers in the industry. Over the years, I’ve brought them into several companies and recommended them to even more–and they’ve knocked it out of the park. Every. Single. Time. There is no other group I’d ever consider working with. SmartBug is THE Perpetual Value Generation Machine.

			If you are looking to increase your marketing power by 10x, SmartBug is the partner for you. SmartBug completely changed the course of our marketing strategy. The entire team, and especially Paul, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable while we refined our process. And once it was refined, it became an extremely powerful machine! Our website traffic increased from 1,200 to 14,000 in under a year, with visits converting at a 4 percent rate. I can only connect this to the diligent and intelligent work that the SmartBug team did for us.

We are so pleased with the template that we are in the process of replacing all of our old pages to the SmartBug design. The team was responsive and got the work completed correctly and quickly. Ryan, Andrew, and Ben were wonderful to work with. I would recommend them to any other business. I will be using SmartBug for marketing strategies.

Whether we’re meeting up at Inbound or discussing our next digital marketing campaign a thousand miles apart, SmartBug will always be considered part of our family. We could not have asked for a better, more knowledgeable, or friendlier team to work with. We wouldn’t recommend anyone other than SmartBug Media! Thank you Paul and Aaron for everything that you continue do for us.

			SmartBug gave us not only a professional inbound strategy, but also a professional support organization. As the CEO of a small, rapidly growing company, I didn’t have a lot of time to devote to the daily ins and outs of the program. SmartBug’s understanding of our customers, products, and business objectives allowed me to focus on my priorities and trust them to run with the ball and ensure our program succeeded. Again, it’s difficult for small businesses to zoom in and focus on the small things that can help seriously move the needle—and we are able to do so because of them. The SmartBug team helps our company to be professional and cutting-edge in our marketing and lead gen strategy and execution.

			We're a young, rapidly growing tech company that was focused on engineering first, resulting in an amazing product but little to show for marketing. Inbound was new to us, and we were flying blind before they came along. Other firms we tried put the responsibility on us to figure out what we wanted to do, which was really frustrating. That all ended after our first call. Our team grew with four of the most talented professionals I've ever worked, not to mention the designers and programmers that work behind the scenes. They brought tried-and-true best practices, in addition to in-depth research on our product and industry. Ryan, Amber, and team have helped us grow our contacts tenfold, triple our conversion rate, cut our sales cycle in half, all while developing the richest content we've ever put out. More than just execution, they've taught us principles and strategy behind inbound. Always responsive with the answers needed—I don't want to think about where we'd be without them!

You can read the other reviews to hear the details about how much these guys know about inbound, SEO, content, and so on. This review will talk about money, specifically how SmartBug has helped NSI make more money. All I care about is MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue), more specifically I want to grow MRR, every day, every week, and every month! I asked these guys to help me do that and they have delivered. With their help, guidance, and assistance, NSI has grown our MRR significantly—month. Don’t make the mistake I made: As soon you get on HubSpot, get signed up with SmartBug. They help you make money.

			SmartBug is more than just a partner for us. They are members of our team, invested in our success as much as we are. As a technology company, we have a tendency to focus on the product and the problems we work to solve, and we struggle with how we can share our findings with others. SmartBug has helped us share our work with the world. I have worked with several firms. In most instances, I have had to actively direct teams of people and serve as the leading expert. However, with SmartBug, we work together. They lean on me to understand our business, and I lean on them for their marketing expertise and strengths. It is a true partnership, and I have grown tremendously as a marketer by working with them.

			We've found great value in SmartBug, and a consummately professional team in Ryan and Amber. Engaging them has helped us stay nimble as a growing technology company. The expertise and resources they bring to us in the consumer and commercial space have been paramount to our continued success. Our contacts have increased immensely, but more than that, we've seen our closure rate increase and our sales cycle shorten. To top it all off, they are understanding and sensitive to the needs of a growing company, remaining flexible when pivots are needed.

			SmartBug is head and shoulders above the competition. Having worked with a number of agencies over my 10+ years in B2B marketing roles, I can definitively say they are the BEST and have made a huge impact on our results. The level of partnership, engagement and owning the outcome is second to none. A true testament to their ability to drive results is we have expanded from what started out as an inbound project to adding paid media, a website redesign, and incorporating everything they do for our North American business for our South America operations, in a totally different language! Clearly, they’re always up for a challenge! We’re so thankful SmartBug; they’re much more than a valued partner—they are an integral part of our corporate family.

			SmartBug has been an extended part of our marketing/sales team pretty much since day one, coming on board to help us with everything from our website to our ongoing lead generation and nurturing campaigns. Their ability to dive below the surface and really understand our business and the SaaS industry has been critical in helping us make sure that our marketing doesn't just look great, it actually speaks to our audience and delivers the results and KPIs we need to grow. And the team's knowledge and understanding of HubSpot—for both marketing and CRM—saves us immeasurable time and money.

			Prior to partnering with SmartBug and HubSpot, our success had been driven primarily through word of mouth. But that only got us so far. To get to the next level, we knew that we had to strategically align ourselves with people that could provide an up-to-date platform to approach and reach prospective clients. We’re very happy to have found what we were looking for in Ryan and the team at SmartBug. With their knowledge of HubSpot and the intricacies of inbound marketing, we’re now headed in the right direction!

			The team at SmartBug came highly recommended by those from inside HubSpot, and they delivered a top-notch template that was easy for us to install and implement for our new company website. There was some extra customization that we needed for the header, and it was easy to have SmartBug make these changes for only two hours work. The template has many page options that it was almost hard to choose which templates to use out of the 30+ included in the pack. Would work with them again.

They kept us on track and focused despite some big internal changes in our company mid-project. They were great at listening to our concerns, collaborating on changes, educating us on best practices, and staying focused on achieving a great end result as we walked through the entire process. I was impressed by their expertise, grateful for their collaborative approach, and thankful for their focused guidance. I hope we have the chance to work together again!

			My company engaged SmartBug approximately nine months ago to help us (a) rebuild our website on HubSpot, and (b) implement an inbound marketing program, also on HubSpot. The numbers speak for themselves. We've seen a step-change in traffic, lead generation, and conversion due to SmartBug's expertise in designing and implementing our new site and our inbound program. Every month I'm able to share metrics with the rest of our executive team that show quantifiable progress toward our end targets for this year. Additionally, SmartBug brings creative new suggestions to us every week for further optimizing traffic and leads. The entire team is professional, organized, and generally ""on the ball.""

			As a startup in stealth mode, brand equity, brand awareness, and process are continuously top of mind for our lean marketing team. To build brand credibility and establish ourselves as a market leader, we needed a proven team with exceptional experience and professionalism to be our partner to scale our baseline marketing efforts. We turned to Ryan, Jessica, and their team of innovators and ""doers"" to ignite our marketing machine. From strategic planning, operational and process organization, content creation, campaign execution, and everything that pops up in between, the SmartBug team truly has become a vital ""arm"" of our go-to-market efforts. Their expertise shines through everything they do, and their reliability defines their mission to help companies like ours scale, grow, and, ultimately, make impact to drive demand. At the end of the day, all marketers crave and need one foundational element: results. And that's what SmartBug will give you. Hands down, no questions—just value.

			I recently finished a website redesign with HubSpot and am now going into a sprint with them. The entire experience has been extremely positive. They teach HubSpot's inbound methodology, and by the time our redesign was over we felt like we not only had a wonderful website but also a full understanding of inbound marketing. SmartBug's team is helpful, hands-on, and always available for a question/problem/request. If I needed them to explain something, they were happy to jump on a video chat and show us the step-by-step process then send us the video recording. I will admit that at the beginning of our website redesign, I had a very specific idea of what I wanted in a website, and our new website looks very different from that idea I had in my head—it looks 1,000 percent better than my ideas and than I could have ever imagined. They shared ideas and collaborated like they were truly part of my team to make sure I had an amazing end product. Amazing experience, great team!

The response was timely, and you could tell the organization had tons of HubSpot experience. Together, we outlined a strong strategic approach to the project, and in less than a week, we had a finished product that achieves our need. This enhancement to our website will certainly be a huge benefit to our marketing and sales teams.

			We have worked with SmartBug Media for about a year and have been so impressed with what they brought to the table for our digital marketing. Their thinking is so strategically focused that there is no question that they know what they are doing. They are a part of our marketing planning now, not just ""the website."" HubSpot, while simple of the surface level, requires a lot of planning and strategic thought. I could not imagine doing this without an agency like SmartBug. We picked them because of all the agencies we talked to, they are the ones who really seemed to understand inbound marketing inside and out. We are so looking forward to what the next year is going to bring for us with inbound marketing and SmartBug at the helm!

Going through a website redesign process with HubSpot COS, SmartBug was able to help us create a site that increased the impact of our brand and marketing. The team was extremely flexible and responsive to questions and feedback. We are now partnered with SmartBug to execute a comprehensive inbound marketing strategy that is further building our thought leadership and reputation. We just were named as part of the Inc. 5000 fastest growing companies, and we consider SmartBug to be an integral part of our strategy to stay on that list. We highly recommend you work with SmartBug Media.

			Before working with SmartBug, we had just terminated another HubSpot partner and were pretty frustrated with the time and money we had wasted. I went back into the search process rather jaded. SmartBug immediately changed my attitude by investing in the sales process and potential relationship. They came right out the gates with improvements and ideas that made great sense … and we had not yet contracted with them. The positive experience has continued well past the courting process and, honestly, has only gotten better. They employ an efficient organizational structure that eliminates the ""go between"" communication that is often ineffective and unnecessary. They also employ intelligent and experienced people, people who have often had their own P&L ownership. The service level and attention is unparalleled ... Katie makes us feel like we are her only client. Like I said, SmartBug gets it!!

			Before contacting SmartBug, we contacted three other HubSpot-certified top-tier partners. Some boasted ex-HubSpot employees and so on; however, they just didn’t have “it.” The process and systems didn’t seem put together, what was promised wasn’t really delivered, and so on. We were sold on HubSpot and knew that we couldn’t internally utilize the platform how we knew it could be utilized, so we figured, “Let’s call SmartBug.” I can honestly say it may have been one of the best decisions we have ever made. The entire staff truly does feel like an extension of our team, reliable, unbelievably knowledgeable, and forward thinking.

			We have been working with SmartBug for about eight months on a completely new website built on the COS and an inbound marketing initiative, and our experience has been nothing short of amazing. From our initial introduction to SmartBug, we have been impressed by the professionalism of the team and the constant follow-up, keeping our project on track. The SmartBug team has deep technical knowledge and has taken our organization to a new level in inbound marketing. Our sales team has been very impressed by the quantity and quality of the leads generated as a result of SmartBug's work—and that is the ultimate test for any marketing initiative: Does it increase sales? I would strongly recommend SmartBug Media to any business seeking to up its game on the digital front and gain the benefit of the powerful HubSpot technology to drive new sales.

Whenever we have new projects, they always come back with close to, if not exactly, what we had in mind. When we find things that need fixing or updating, they are quick to respond and are great about letting us know exactly when we can expect things to be completed. They are extremely responsive and always friendly.

			I've been involved in quite a few website redesigns, and this was the first one where the project was completed on time and on budget. SmartBug's project management and follow-up services teams are incredibly professional and knowledgeable. Their creativity and flexibility also helped build a site that solved our business challenges. As we transitioned from our old site to the new site built from scratch by SmartBug, we wanted to make sure that traffic, SEO, lead capture, and other metrics didn't suffer. Not only did our numbers maintain their previous level, they exceeded it within weeks—and they continue to grow.

			The team at SmartBug is fantastic to work with. As a small marketing team, having a single source for website development as well as web and inbound strategy is really helpful.

			SmartBug has played a crucial role in helping our small marketing team redesign our website, optimize for conversions, and develop strategies to move more leads through the inbound funnel. They are very organized and transparent, which gave us a lot of confidence in their ability to execute and make progress. With very little knowledge of how to approach a website redesign, we are very glad that we had SmartBug to project manage the entire process. Aaron made many critical recommendations on how to improve our website experience, and we ultimately have seen positive results across the board. I highly recommend SmartBug to other small marketing teams who are intimidated by the idea of a website redesign and are seeking outside help with a great deal of experience.

			We recently hired SmartBug Media to assist us in getting two of our brand websites updated with a fresh look and a much improved user experience. We were immediately drawn to the HubSpot expertise and experience that SmartBug brings to the table, and they exceeded our expectations throughout the project. We had a very good working relationship, and in all actuality would have been done early if we would have been able to keep up with them. In addition to website development, we also utilized SmartBug for some help with inbound marketing and creating some marketing automation to help nurture leads, which we have never been able to take advantage of in the past. We will most definitely continue to work with SmartBug in the future and appreciate all of the hard work Kyle, Jessica, Tessa, Amanda, and Ryan did for us on our recent project. I would and do encourage other businesses who are looking for a digital agency with top-notch HubSpot experience to contact SmartBug Media.

			We've been working with SmartBug for almost a year, and I can't say enough about the team. I came across the idea for inbound marketing years ago, loved it (bought HubSpot), but never had the time to actually do anything. Decided to take a chance and go with Hubspot's No. 1 partner. The SmartBug team not only delivered great results, but working with them couldn't have been easier. Most importantly, the content was incredible. As a services business, project management for us is HUGE. We were kept informed, the projects ran on time, and any delays were always our fault—lol. If you're looking for an inbound marketing partner, definitely give SmartBug a shot at your business.

			Smartbug provided the best in customer service, support, and partnership. We are thrilled with our new website and have received rave reviews from everyone who has seen it. Their patience, passion, and ability to understand our culture and organizational needs is second to none. Kyle was the best, and we are very grateful for him and the entire team.

			We have been working with SmartBug Media in various capacities for over a year and I cannot speak more highly of their marketing/consulting services. They are Jedi Masters when it comes to HubSpot and are wonderful teachers/coaches when it comes to looping you in on how to utilize it to your advantage. SmartBug easily streamlines any company's marketing functions and I was amazed how they plugged right into our workflow. Our company industry is super-specialized, which made me raise an eyebrow when it came to hiring a third party for marketing support. They adapted to this industry quicker than most of our new employees! We have experienced incredible results from their SEO optimization, social strategies/tips, and full-on campaigns. Their premium content offers are wonderfully crafted, and we could not have asked for a better marketing strategist. Whatever industry you work in, if you are looking to hire a one-stop shop marketing firm, SmartBug Media is the one to hire.

			We have worked with other inbound agencies in the past, but SmartBug is an inbound marketing agency unlike any other—a class act, driven by passion, a strong work ethic, and high standards, without any weak links. My team and I have partnered with SmartBug for the past six months. Our rebranding strategy dovetailed into a website relaunch with an aggressive timetable that Kyle and his team were able to accomplish on time and within budget. We are a fast-growing B2B tech company operating in the genuine white space of web archiving. On the inbound and GDD side, Juli and Aaron took the time to learn about our business, clients, and industry to help us achieve our goals. They have been a true extension of our marketing team, without the compromise or disconnect. SmartBug is a cultivated team that drives results and helps you to achieve your marketing goals.

			SmartBug has been a very good partner for us. They helped us develop a thorough plan and then executed their part very well. The team is very professional and committed to delivering quality work. I would strongly recommend leveraging their services.
			Gregg Morin
			VP of Sales, Health Data Vision
		
		
		
			
				
				
			
			Their spectrum of knowledge and expertise in all things inbound, website development, HubSpot CMS, and lead gen is amazing. But what impressed me the most was their willingness, from day one, to TRULY partner with us to address the issues that WE wanted to address. From our first call with the sales department through the day-to-day work with their development team, they always put our needs first and worked diligently to achieve the goals that we set from day one. In past experiences with other companies, it always seemed to be driven by their agenda and not ours. SmartBug Media GETS IT! While we have finished up our initial project, we look forward to partnering with them moving forward and have the confidence that the work will be done professionally, on time, and on budget.

			SmartBug did a fantastic job for us. We are a boutique law firm that specializes in telecom, and they helped developed a website that looks great. They are very familiar with HubSpot and helped us to integrate. In fact, our HubSpot reps were amazed at the scope of service Smart Bug provided for us. I've been through website design processes before, and this experience was better in every way. I can highly recommend them.

			Our firm is new to inbound marketing (HubSpot in particular) but not to rolling out websites. SmartBug’s web development team did a fantastic job from scoping to executing, was prompt and personable, and delivered right on budget. I couldn't say that about any of our prior developers. And their input on our buyer personas and tailoring our site to optimize HubSpot's functionality will prove to be immensely valuable long after the launch of the site. SmartBug Media is smart indeed.

			SmartBug helped us with a very large website relaunch—starting us to use inbound for the first time, and providing thoughtful feedback and data to make informed decisions on the updates we needed to make.

			We are a startup senior housing company with a goal to reimagine the website experience for our prospects and to create a personalized journey based on persona and stage of readiness. The SmartBug team embraced the challenge and created a design, messaging, and navigation that matched our unique vision. The results have exceeded our expectations! We recouped our investment within the first 30 days of launching the website. I found the SmartBug team to be collaborative and responsive throughout the journey, from concept to go-live.
			Debbie Howard
			VP of Marketing, Vitality Senior Living
		
		
		
			
				
				
				
				
			
			We are very happy to have SmartBug as an extension of our marketing team. They consistently deliver relevant and informative content for our audience (we are a medical device company in a niche market) and provide useful insight and suggestions for keywords/blog topics that have helped increase our SEO ranking. They are always available for questions, extremely professional, and easily adapt to our changing needs as our marketing strategy evolves. SmartBug is an all-around great inbound marketing partner!

			We worked with SmartBug Media, specifically with Jessica and Kristen, on advancing our efforts to equip, nurture, inspire, and mobilize volunteers to deliver our prevention messages in schools and communities. With their guidance, we developed somewhat ambitious but realistic outcomes and a step-by-step plan to achieve them. Their level of focus, willingness to roll up their sleeves, and flexibility made SmartBug a pleasure to work with. When our contract ended due to a change in funding, they equipped us with everything we would need to continue our efforts internally for the following year, which we greatly appreciated. We would definitely hire them again for another project.

			SmartBug has proved to be a great partner in the design and development of five new or updated websites. Their project team was organized, efficient, and responsive, and was always able to address new feature requests quickly. They are a wonderful collaborative partner.
			Bill Skowronnek
			Senior Director of Marketing, Health & Safety Institute
		
		
		
			
				
				
				
				
			
			My team at Smartbug has given our content structure and consistency. The greatest thing? They respond. They listen. They advise. They are a true partnership of wanting the best for our business and providing us ideas that translate into forward motion. Jessica and Sarah have been outstanding in their work with us thus far.

			SmartBug was an essential partner in our launch because of their consultative approach to strategy, their highly efficient working style, and clear communication. At the risk of sounding trite, I don't think I could have done it without them. The initial launch was smooth and stress-free, and our site is beautiful. At each step of the way, they have had thoughtful input that pushed our work forward, while still being flexible with any constraints we are working with.

			I had a simple need to customize email templates based on some existing templates I found in the HubSpot marketplace. However, finding the right partner wasn't so easy, as most companies I've reached out to wanted to charge me thousands of dollars, which I thought was unacceptable. SmartBug was not only very reasonable, but also extremely efficient and delivered exactly what I needed without forcing me into committing to some multi-year contracts and promising large revenues for many years ahead. However, because my experience was smooth and extremely positive, I'd definitely reach out to them again for future work.

			Brian Halligan
			Co-Founder and CEO, HubSpot
		
		
		
			
				
				
				
				
			
			As the manager of over 70 providers in the HubSpot Service Marketplace, SmartBug Media managed to stand out above the rest in several ways—no small feat. Their president, Ryan Malone, is always incredibly responsive (I don't think he sleeps), helpful, thoughtful, experienced, and willing to take on even the most unhappy or niche vertical clients easily.
			Liz Rickleffs
			Partner Marketplace Manager, HubSpot
		
		
		
			
				
				
				
				
			
			SmartBug is the first Partner I think of when HubSpot customers ask me for a recommendation. Everyone there knows inbound marketing inside and out. From my very first interaction, I've been impressed with the strategic plans they develop, and I always know they will do the work needed to make sure their clients see success.
			Adam Gerard

			If you're looking for an agency to help with inbound marketing strategy, you're doing yourself a disservice by not speaking with SmartBug Media. The SmartBug team knows how to put together a plan based around your business goals and then fully execute on that plan. Their team is a pleasure to work with and helps businesses see success with inbound marketing.
			Conor Crimmins

			Having worked closely with the team at SmartBug Media, they get my highest recommendation. They are thought leaders in inbound marketing and have cultivated a team that drives results. SmartBug is performance-driven and truly aims to act as an extension of their clients’ teams.
			Rob Litterest

			Working with SmartBug is always great. It can be difficult to find a certified HubSpot agency that takes the time to get to know a business, and then fully executes on a plan. The SmartBug team does just that. If I were a client looking for help with HubSpot, SmartBug would be at the top of the list.
			Morgan Jacobson

			SmartBug Media is always my No. 1 choice to refer my HubSpot customers to because I know their team will drive results. Aside from being great people, their team are some of the smartest inbound marketers I know and are always putting the customer's needs first. Anyone who feels like they aren't getting the most out of their inbound marketing program should call SmartBug.
			Sam Moorhead

Their passion, strong work ethic, and high standards will help any business to achieve their goals. It is without hesitation that I recommend SmartBug Media if you want to see measurable bottom-line results with your inbound marketing efforts.

			My interactions with SmartBug Media have given me great confidence in recommending them to HubSpot customers in need of a partner. They are professional, organized, experienced, and, most importantly, customer success-centric. Implementing inbound marketing is no small task, but SmartBug Media helps companies of all sizes not only implement inbound, but drive results that matter to them.

			SmartBug has been a pioneer in inbound marketing, providing assistance to technology, healthcare, and general business clients for more than four years. They have a very effective methodology that provides the right amount of hand-holding to ensure success. They sweat the details and communicate effectively with clients to get the best results. Ryan Malone and the team have been very effective at helping bring inbound marketing effectiveness to dozens of companies.
			Dan Tyre

			SmartBug has cracked the code on hiring top-notch, savvy inbound marketers. Every person I've interacted with on their team has impressed me with their professionalism, their knowledge of inbound, and their eye to the future of marketing. It takes a special kind of agency to attract and maintain such a consistently high level of talent. SmartBug has done just that. I'd recommend them to any company or organization looking to build out their inbound marketing strategy.

            Most websites include, at minimum, a theme and several extensions. To maintain performance, these extensions must be regularly updated. That's where our team of experts comes in.

            You have just seconds to capture visitors' attention. Make every moment count with a high-performing website. Our specialists stay on top of industry best practices to fuel your success.
            
          
          
          
            
            Enhance Functionality
            As your brand evolves, your website is likely to scale with custom design elements and technical configuration. We'll maximize your website's functionality without sacrificing performance metrics such as bounce rate and page speed.  
            
          
          
          
            
            Mitigate Risk
            Flag potential risks before they become real problems. Our technical audits and monthly reports give your team a realistic picture of your website's performance on a regular basis so you can strategize and optimize accordingly.
            
          
          
        
      
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
      
    
  














Let's Enhance Your Online Presence

Even after launch day, your website is never truly ""complete."" We'll roll out optimization strategies that keep your online presence fresh, functional, and strategically engineered for revenue growth.

			  The challenge: When your website's page speed slows or your visitors encounter a clunky user experience (UX), you risk a decline in engagement and a stall in conversions. 
Our approach: Our technical audit offers a comprehensive evaluation of your website to identify opportunities for optimization, increase engagement, and improve overall website performance. We lead with data-driven strategies to enhance your online presence across all key metrics so you can attract new visitors, boost conversions, and drive revenue. We'll measure our success against several key performance indicators, including but not limited to:

Page speed
Engagement rate
Acquisition sources performance
Exit rate
Average time spent

        
      
		
  
  
  
		
			
			
        
        

          
          
          
          

        
				
			
      
      
			  The challenge: Unprotected websites too often become targets for bad actors online. The consequences can be significant; they can affect your site's performance, lead to the theft of sensitive data, and damage your customers' trust. The same applies to plugins.
Our approach: We'll begin by implementing security and performance modules (caching). Then, as part of our monthly update plan, our maintenance team will carve out time each month to update your CMS and modules. Your project's total estimated hours will depend on the project scale and the complexity of your module configuration. Our CMS updates include:

Monthly CMS update
Critical and functional module updates
Site overview (quality assurance)
Monthly status report via email

            When we first engaged SmartBug more than a year ago, we had just let go of our head of marketing and had no idea where to take our marketing strategy. Since we started, we have doubled the resources we have from SmartBug and completed a complete website rebuild. To date, we are more than 200% up year on year for our key metrics and super excited to continue our work with SmartBug.

            The SmartBug team approach is tactical and focused. From the initiation of our work together they really sought an understanding of our vision and product. I am grateful for their partnership and commitment to ensuring the interactive experience and product outcome is positive for all involved.

And SmartBug has strong overall project management of activities.

            The team at SmartBug was phenomenal from the quotation and project scope process all the way through the completion and integration of the final website. What impressed us the most about SmartBug was the limited amount of time required for them to understand our message. If there was any language or messaging that needed clarification, they processed the feedback from us quickly and implemented the changes in an efficient fashion.

    SmartBugapalooza
Not Just Any Work Conference: SmartBug's Company-Wide IRL Event
At SmartBug Media®, we're proud to represent the best and the brightest minds in full-service digital marketing, thanks to our remote-first culture. Over the last 17 years, we've grown our team to nearly 300 subject matter experts from Montreal to Mexico City, New York to Nashville, Seattle to San Diego, and everywhere in between. 

As a way to collectively recharge and reconnect, we gather as a company for several days of team building, skill strengthening, and team awards and accolades at a centrally located five-star hotel. In between scheduled activities, we leave plenty of room to relax and unwind with group events, team lunches, casual happy hours, and local sightseeing.

SmartBugapalooza isn't like other work events. It's a pull-out-all-the-stops, remember-til-you're-gray kind of experience that's all about making meaningful connections with teammates from all corners of the globe.

Frequently Asked Questions









  
    
    
      
        What are sales enablement services, and how can they benefit my business?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Sales enablement services equip your sales team with the tools, resources, and strategies they need to sell more effectively. Our services are tailored to fit your company's needs, and can include providing custom content for different stages of the buyer’s journey, training programs, and integrations to streamline processes and improve communication between sales and marketing teams.

Some of the benefits of a well-run sales enablement program are:

Improved efficiency through centralizing and organizing sales content like case studies and demos, allowing reps to spend more time with prospects rather than searching for resources.
Better Sales and Marketing alignment ensures both teams work collaboratively and allows marketing to create materials that resonate with prospects and then adjust strategies based on shared feedback.
Sales reps are enabled to address buyer concerns faster with targeted content and insights, shortening sales cycles and boosting revenue, leading to enhanced deal velocity.
Continuous training and coaching help sales teams stay updated on industry trends and refine their skills over time.
Sales enable equips lower-performing reps with tools to improve their results, elevating the entire team's success rates. Who doesn't love increased win rates?

Sales enablement services are particularly impactful in B2B sales, where decision-making involves multiple stakeholders and longer average time to close. When your CRM and martech stack work well together, we can further enhance sales enablement by automating tasks, tracking engagement, and providing data-driven insights to tailor approaches to effectively benefit your business.

Background
A leader in the senior living space with communities across the country was rapidly acquiring new locations when it came to SmartBug in search of a streamlined solution for website creation. The client originally recruited us to help build their new websites out, but then late in the game the executive leadership team informed them that they intended to launch all 300 sites by the end of the year. That's when SmartBug had to come up with a quick solution—smack in the middle of the project.

Stressed and overwhelmed with the thought of having to create hundreds of websites individually, the provider required a solution that could quickly create sites while still allowing for individual customization. SmartBug got to work.


















  
    
    
      
        
        
          
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Problem
So Many Websites, So Little Time
To unify branding across newly acquired locations, the client needed to launch 300 websites within a year. This lofty goal was initially considered unrealistic due to the provider’s limited marketing team, the potential for errors with manual creation, and the extensive content entry required. The client needed to update existing outdated sites and create additional sites—all with unified branding. The provider’s manual processes would not have allowed its team to successfully reach that goal in the allotted time frame. 
        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  


















	
    
    
      
      The solution allowed the client to hit their deadline, but there were all these side benefits that came from it … like easier management moving forward, consistency, and ease of use.

Our Solution
Using HubSpot to Design a Custom Website Generator Tool for Quick Site Creation


HubDB: Structured all community-specific data (e.g., address, amenities, contacts) for dynamic population


Serverless functions: Implemented a serverless function to create the site pages using a marketer-friendly form within a custom landing page


Custom modules and theme: Built flexible, SEO-optimized page templates that automatically populate using HubDB entries


CMS tools: Supported drag-and-drop edits for marketing users without backend development help


The senior living provider’s overall goal was to unify its branding across rapidly acquired locations while simultaneously updating outdated sites. Initially, the provider considered hiring a third party for content entry, which would have been a hefty expense. 

The SmartBug team came through with a super slick tool capable of automating website creation in a matter of minutes. The solution uses HubSpot HubDB tables to store community data (e.g., logos, contact info, amenities), allowing for quick implementation of changes across all sites and enabling easier management moving forward. One-click site generation via a HubSpot serverless function creates approximately 20 similarly structured webpages per community with unique, dynamically populated content, allowing for necessary customization while maintaining consistency and SEO considerations (e.g., duplicate content).

It’s also important to note that the creation of comprehensive HubDB tables with community data was time-intensive, and the client’s small marketing team was pressured by an ambitious deadline. In the end, core development of the project was estimated at 3-4 months, and SmartBug’s help saved the client an estimated $300,000 in production costs.

















  
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Results
Thousands of Hours Saved by Minimizing Manual Work Contracts Establishment
Overall, the client is excited about the automated website creation solution and its capabilities. The team is ""jumping up and down"" about the significant time savings it will inevitably provide. Site creation happens in a matter of minutes versus 10-20 hours.

For reference, the time savings for creating each community website using the automated solution versus manually is approximately 20-30 hours per website. Ultimately, the automation is estimated to save anywhere from 6,000-9,000 hours of manual work across all 300 sites. The resulting time savings and boost in productivity free up the client's marketing team to focus on other strategic efforts.

        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  









The solution implemented by SmartBug also significantly reduces the need for content entry and management, leading to significant time and cost savings for the client. By enabling rapid site creation while maintaining brand consistency, the tool allows for quick global changes across all sites post-launch, along with the flexibility of traditional editing and updates for individual sites. As a result:
  ● Sites can now go live in less than one hour with fully branded, content-compliant websites—no backend development help required.
  ● Pages have fewer errors and are faster to launch due to quick and easy training, boosting team morale and performance.

            I'm so grateful we had SmartBug's support when implementing Sales Enterprise for our team. Our business model is unique, and we require a lot of customization and workarounds to make the platform suit our needs - it would have been so confusing and frustrating without help. We were so impressed with Alex's level of knowledge. They have been patient and engaging, working with a large group of people with great professionalism. Thank you for everything, Alex!

            Having now worked with several consultants across our business, without a doubt, our SmartBug partners - Megan Golden and Danielle Avilla - rise to the top as THE BEST. Their approach feels very ""white glove"", from scheduling out our meeting cadence, prepping agendas, taking ownership of calls, listening and strategizing through issues, documenting action items, and managing follow-up. This SmartBug team is personable, accountable, and a true business partner. Thank you!!

            Working with the team is an absolute delight! In particular, Charles E. is a great partner who spends time to understand our business, gives insightful advice, and provides hands on technical expertise to help us meet our goals. Our implementation went so smoothly and we are confident with our own skills to continue to support this. We look forward to continuing working with Charles as we expand our HubSpot capabilities.

            Working with SmartBug for the last two years has been great - they're truly an extension of our team. They've enabled us to better manage our bandwidth and workload, have the expertise and knowledge to guide us in areas we could use some additional training (SEO, Analytics, HubSpot) and serve as an external, non-biased voice of support during our strategy process. Our account managers have been great since the beginning - extremely responsive, flexible and always help us reach our goals. We appreciate having them in our corner!

Highly recommend!

Background
WesleyLife is a senior living provider with several communities across Iowa offering a full continuum of care, from independent living to long-term care to innovative at-home services. The organization had the infrastructure and expertise to serve the health and well-being needs of the senior population and their families—it just needed the digital marketing chops to spread the word. 
With no prior marketing automation in place, WesleyLife was starting from scratch and needed help guiding prospects through the decision-making process. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub created a foundation to support a scalable, multi-service digital funnel. 
SmartBug was ready to provide full customer lifecycle support across the funnel, from awareness to decision—and even post-decision. After an initial website reboot, WesleyLife was ready to put HubSpot marketing to the test through post-tour, close lost, and MQL-specific nurtures.

















  
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Problem
Struggling with Inadequate Marketing Tools 
WesleyLife was in a pickle, facing a dual challenge: The senior living giant was relying on outdated marketing tools that hindered its ability to nurture leads effectively, resulting in longer sales cycles and missed opportunities. Without automated nurturing or centralized workflows, the organization struggled to continuously engage prospects over the 6–12 month decision cycle typical in senior living. 

WesleyLife wanted to streamline the processes holding it back from integrating marketing across service lines, shortening sales cycles, and expanding its at-home services. So the organization turned to SmartBug to update its website and implement marketing best practices to improve lead generation and nurturing. 
        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  


















	
    
    
      
      Let’s just say our marketing stack had some... vintage charm. We've come a long way since! We’ve become an innovative, forward-thinking senior living organization in how we manage our data and digital marketing efforts.

Our Solution
Driving Qualified Leads, Boosting Conversions, and Accelerating the Sales Cycle

HubSpot Workflows to support community-based, post-tour emails triggered by lead status in WelcomeHome





Lead Scoring with custom properties and behavioral scoring for recruiting
Smart Content with nurture emails that include dynamically populated modules based on lead attributes
HubSpot Lists and Forms that incorporate segmentation to tailor content by location, care type, and family status


SmartBug implemented HubSpot Marketing Hub to address WesleyLife’s outdated tools, establishing a modern, automated marketing foundation. With this infrastructure in place, we developed targeted post-tour nurture workflows to keep prospects engaged throughout the long decision cycle typical of senior living. We also created nurturing sequences to maintain long-term engagement with soft-disqualified leads, scheduling outreach for about a year later. 
WesleyLife’s content touched two key personas—active seniors and caregivers—with workflows incorporating a variety of emails to keep prospects engaged and informed:


 
 

Review requests
Testimonials
Floor plan options
Community evaluation guides

 
 
SmartBug set up tracking to monitor leads through different lifecycle stages—moving each as needed from SQL to post-tour follow-up, all the way to opportunity/reservation and resident. All activities were seamlessly integrated with the WelcomeHome CRM, enabling clear visibility into each prospect’s journey.

      All these little things that SmartBug kicked off ultimately drive leads and conversions. That's what matters.But we've also been given so many great educational tools that never existed before.

Background
Union EAP is a specialized employee assistance program (EAP) dedicated to supporting organized labor unions and their members across the United States, most commonly sheet metal workers (SMWs). The organization focuses on creating sustainable, recovery-friendly workplaces by addressing a range of challenges, including mental health, substance use, financial, and legal issues.​

The organization's leadership, including CEO Ben Cort and COO Melissa Burke, LCSW, brings extensive experience in behavioral health and a deep commitment to serving the labor community. Their mission is to foster stigma-free, trust-based organizational cultures that prioritize the well-being of union members.​

















  
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        
        The Problem
Care Coordinators in Dire Need of a Connectivity and Compliance Overhaul 
At the core of Union EAP's services is a national network of centrally managed Care Coordinators—licensed clinicians available 24/7/365. These professionals provide immediate crisis response, prevention education, and assistance in accessing a comprehensive continuum of high-quality services to union members and their families. They also verify members' benefits, including deductible status and out-of-pocket maximums, to offer practical solutions beyond merely listing in-network providers.​

The role of Care Coordinators is essential as the demand for employee assistance programs and care increases. This trend emphasized the growing team’s dire need to implement formal systems and scalable processes for opening, managing, and tracking cases. The existing manual, disconnected tracking systems used by individual care coordinators were insufficient, offering no centralized visibility. There was also an urgency to implement a HIPAA-compliant system for managing sensitive member data.

To combat these challenges, the SmartBug team worked with Melissa Burke and the Care Coordinators to implement HubSpot Marketing, Sales and Service Hub. The teams also collaborated to migrate the Union EAP website to HubSpot’s Content Hub, allowing for closed-loop reporting and expanding marketing efforts through the creation of landing page, thank you page, blog, and email templates
        
      
    
    
  

  
  
  


















	
    
    
      
      As a new company just starting out, everything just seems so gray and so questionable, and [SmartBug] helped us build a path. I thought that was amazing, and now every time we have a ticket that's open, we know that all of our Care Coordinators are protected. Because if something were to arise, everything's documented. We know that if they call back, the person answering the phone is going to know exactly what's going on. We know that everything is in one spot, so all of our PandaDocs are right there. All of the contacts that we need […] all of the information is right there and easy to get. I don't think we would have been so successful in that without SmartBug and Aubreigh helping us navigate.

Our Solution
Leveraging HubSpot Tools to Establish a Case Management Pipeline Structure

Implementation of HubSpot Content Hub, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub
Custom Naming Conventions for HIPAA Compliance
Creation of Custom Properties, Custom Objects, Custom Reporting, and Dashboards
Native Integrations with Dialpad and PandaDoc
Migration Support from Wix to HubSpot
Meeting Scheduler and Ticketing Pipeline
Snippets and Email Templates
Weekly Care Coordinator Workshops


The SmartBug team began with an in-depth discovery meeting to gain a better understanding of Union EAP’s mission and services and how those services address the pain points of its audience—union members and partnered unions. This process involved live walkthroughs of fictional example scenarios to establish a formal yet accessible system for case outreach. 

SmartBug helped address the client’s data security gaps by implementing Sensitive Data properties in HubSpot, which partitioned access through the setup of users and teams. Custom naming conventions were used for HIPAA compliance (e.g., the first three letters of first and last names), ensuring only necessary parties could view sensitive information.

Service Hub was instrumental in creating an efficient case management pipeline, which leverages custom properties and objects to build customized reports and dashboards. The new ticketing pipeline, complete with Dialpad and PandaDoc integrations, uses leadership-specific tracking when assigning clinical versus non-clinical cases. Content Hub and Marketing Hub were used in conjunction to execute a detailed marketing plan, which also involved setting up basic snippets and templates in Sales Hub. Additionally, SmartBug supervised the client’s migration from Wix to HubSpot, providing technical support and optimization throughout the process.

		The Beginner’s Guide to HubSpot Integrations to Maximize Business Operations
		These days, marketers are equipped with multiple software options and applications to help their strategies and channels function at optimal levels. With these tools comes a significant amount of manual work, such as plugging data from one system to another or copying and pasting content from one location to the next. It’s tedious, but it’s critical to the success of your business. 

Luckily, there is a way to connect HubSpot (your primary software) to the applications you use (even if those applications don’t come with HubSpot) so data is centrally located and moves back and forth automatically. And the best part? Very little human effort is required, so you can focus on bigger-picture strategies for your clients.

This process is called an integration. Read on to learn about the basics of integrating applications to HubSpot, who should be using integrations, when to perform integrations, and the most popular integrations for professionals in your position.

					Integrations essentially connect HubSpot with applications so they easily pass data back and forth, providing user access to more features and options within the software. As your business evolves, integrations allow you to keep using HubSpot as your primary software while third-party applications enhance the system and provide additional features. 
With integrations, you'll have:


More power to achieve a wider range of tasks in a shorter amount of time
Reduced manual workload and human error 
More up-to-date information 
Fewer silos between teams
Better connection between systems 

Without integrations, processes can easily break down. For example, data silos frequently occur between sales and marketing departments when systems aren’t “speaking” to each other. The HubSpot and Salesforce integration—one of the more popular used by marketing organizations—solves this pain point by connecting data between these two systems, allowing sales to interact with records without entering HubSpot and vice-versa. Without an integration between these two systems, marketers and sales teams would need to log into the other system (and possibly learn an entirely new system), which leads to wasted time and energy. 
Who should be using integrations?
Marketers, salespeople, IT personnel, operations managers, revenue leaders, and many other professionals and departments that use multiple platforms can benefit from integrations. You know as well as anyone else that organizational departments are constantly sharing information, and the better each department’s individual software interacts, the easier day-to-day processes become. 

Integrations are useful to any and all businesses, regardless of size or industry. In fact, integrations are equally suited for start-ups and enterprise companies, and for any purpose—including advertising, analytics, and content.

					You’ll find (or have already found) certain terminology associated with integrations that needs to be defined to better understand the process. As you learn more about integrations, two terms will crop up repeatedly: APIs and iPaaS.
What is an API?
An application programming interface, or API, is a software used to receive information from servers and applications. The majority of integrations are built on APIs. 

Building integrations on APIs connects integrations to your software and uses them simultaneously with other applications. In other words, APIs essentially allow the applications and devices to talk after they’re integrated. 
What is an iPaaS solution?
Integration platform as a service (iPaaS) and integrations are similar processes with distinct differences:

Integrations are a one-to-one solution. In other words, integrations directly connect software and an application through an API and require specialized personnel to define how data should move in and out of systems.
An iPaaS solution is a cloud-based platform that connects software and applications without the need to write software specifically for an integration.

iPaaS solutions are often used when an integration solution is not available on your software’s marketplace. You might turn to a low-code or no-code program such as Zapier that allows you to move data without needing to know the programming behind the scenes. It’s an easy way to perform an integration without extensive technical knowledge.

					So far, you’ve learned about why you should use integrations, so let’s talk about when you need integrations. These situations might not always be obvious, so let’s take a look at a handful of common scenarios that call for one.
You’re manually updating data into systems.
Among the many signs that suggest an integration would be helpful, manual data entry is the most important. With the immense amount of data collected by your applications, data entry isn’t a good use of your time, and it can be more easily and accurately performed when information flows between your system and applications. 
You’re generating a lot of leads but fewer sales.
More leads don’t automatically equal higher conversion rates, and a number of reasons might be preventing conversions. However, if your marketing efforts are generating leads but your sales team doesn’t have easy access to that information, your sales are going to suffer. Full-cycle reporting can be accomplished through the integration of your marketing and sales platforms.
Ad performance and attribution are unclear.
Advertising services can become expensive. If you don’t know where to target your efforts, you might be wasting time and money that don’t lead to conversions or revenue. 

By integrating your ad application (such as Google Ads) with HubSpot, you can find the channels, ads, and leads that are providing the most ROI to inform current and future targeting efforts.
Posting to social media channels is disorganized.
A social media strategy is an essential part of a marketing strategy, but plenty of departments quickly fall behind on posting when they’re forced to go through the manual process of logging into multiple social accounts.
With social media management applications such as Sprout Social, you can schedule out postings rather than manually juggling multiple platforms. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social media platforms also integrate with HubSpot to provide more data about your audience and which posts receive the most interaction.
Conversions in your store are unclear.
In the e-commerce world, collecting data on purchasing decisions and customer interactions with product pages is a given, but pushing that data further can lead to better revenue opportunities. 
An integration with Klaviyo can provide insight into buying behaviors for upsell opportunities. For example, if certain buyers frequently purchase short sleeve shirts with shorts, marketers can make informed decisions to promote bundle deals on these items.
It’s unclear how users are interacting with your content.
The ultimate goal of a blogging strategy is to create leads, so the type of content you create needs to be useful to readers. This is only possible if you can attribute certain blog posts to new leads. From there, you have insight into the most engaging and useful types of content for your audience.
You’re experiencing poor webinar data.
An integration with a video conference application, such as Zoom, will tell you who joined, how long they stayed, and the participants’ level of engagement through chat interaction or surveys. With this information, you can place participants into different lead nurture groups. Viewers who participated less might benefit from more awareness level content. Those who participated more could benefit from decision stage content.

					How Are Integrations Accessed and Performed?
					When you’re ready to integrate an application with HubSpot, the first place to look is the HubSpot App Marketplace to see if the integration exists. From there, it’s time to perform the integration.
				
				
			

			
				
					When you’re ready to integrate an application with HubSpot, the first place to look is the HubSpot App Marketplace to see if the integration exists. From there, it’s time to perform the integration. 
Although each integration looks a little different, expect to follow this step-by-step process:

Access the setup guide. 
Click the install button and follow the instructions.
The majority of the instructions offer prompts for integration parameters such as turning certain settings on and off.


In some cases, the HubSpot App Marketplace will not have the integration. You can perform a Google search to find a solution for the integration through a third party. It’s also possible that the integration is built into the application but not listed in the marketplace.

					What Are the Most Popular Integrations?

					The following integrations are some of the most popular for marketing organizations. From ad analytics to email marketing and e-commerce platforms, they’ll cover a number of departments and services.
Keep in mind, this is just a sampling of frequently used integrations. If you don’t find one you’re looking for, check out the HubSpot App Marketplace. The integrations listed below connect with HubSpot, and they also work with other programs. 

Let’s take a look at a handful of integrations that could benefit your team, categorized by business need.
Advertising Integrations
Advertising integrations help you better understand your target audience based on data in your HubSpot CRM. By knowing more about your audience, you can deliver more relevant ads. 

By integrating with social media ad platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram, you can target customers with highly relevant ads. You can also receive reports on the true ROI of your campaigns. Reporting on ad success comes through a number of attribution views so you can see how ad spend influences your bottom line. Managing ad campaigns in HubSpot with the rest of your marketing helps maintain a consistent narrative between your follow-up and the rest of marketing. 

Google Ads is another frequently used integration for paid ad campaigns. With a Google Ads HubSpot integration, targeting your customers with relevant ads and reporting on the ROI of ad campaigns is easy. By connecting your account, you can report on ad success through a number of attribution views and see how ad spend influences your bottom line. Reporting within HubSpot tells a consistent story within the context of your other marketing campaigns.
Analytics Integrations
Analytics integrations measure the success of your marketing efforts to illuminate which campaigns work and which need to be modified. This information can be viewed in different ways and well-organized in HubSpot so your teams can review it at any time. 

A Google Analytics integration connects HubSpot customer information with Google Analytics data and provides the following benefits:

New insights into the lifecycle stages of marketing leads and sales leads
Understanding of the content or campaigns that helped secure large deals 
Analysis of the personas most effective for you
Custom dimensions for every event pushed from HubSpot to Google Analytics
And many more events that refine your reports and campaigns 

Connector Integrations
Connector integrations save time and add functionality by accessing dozens of applications that sync to HubSpot. In addition to offering a range of applications, some connect integrations can create custom integrations. 

The Zapier integration is one of the most widely used. With it, you can automatically connect HubSpot (or another software) to over 1,000 applications. No coding is required, and you can view and share data in your HubSpot portal. 
E-Commerce Integrations
For e-commerce businesses, e-commerce integrations offer opportunities to learn more about the behaviors of customers and website visitors. With access to this information in HubSpot, you can make data-based decisions to deliver reengagement content to regain the interest of your customers. 

The Shopify integration is one of the most popular for e-commerce businesses. By connecting your store with HubSpot, you can:

Analyze Shopify data such as average order value, lifetime order value, and abandoned cart rate
Sync product, contact, and orders
Segment customers and leads based on product interactions
Automate marketing campaigns

Email and Communications Integrations
With email and communication platform integrations, you can optimize communication with customers, prospects, and team members. 
Monitoring your email campaigns shows you more about your audience and the effectiveness of your email content. With a Gmail integration, sent emails are logged from Gmail to your HubSpot CRM with one click. Email information, such as opens and clicks, is tracked in real time. Plus, you have access to the tools you need—templates, sequences, meetings, and more—to work more efficiently. 
Both HubSpot and Slack connect you with coworkers and clients every day, making this integration ideal for team collaboration and coordination. You can use features in either the application or software so no time is wasted moving back and forth between them. Instead, the same information will be found in both locations. 
Event and Webinar Integrations
Wherever you host customers, prospects, and team members, certain integrations can simplify in-person events, online meetings, webinars, and video conferences. After an integration, booking, attendee interaction, and contact management can all be done in HubSpot.

If you use Eventbrite for in-person or virtual events, the integration provides insight into promotion, follow-up, and audience engagement in the following ways:

Improve event promotion and follow-up by utilizing event information to inform strategy for segmenting email lists and creating automated workflows. 
Increase event engagement visibility with automatically generated contacts in HubSpot for new registrants. 
Turn event engagement into action by using event information to inform lead scoring so that your sales reps are ready to reach out to participants who are most likely to convert into customers. 

With a Zoom integration, you can promote conferences or webinars, gather contact information for future workflows, track webinar attendance and audience participation, and automatically record, transcribe, and analyze all calls.
Lead Generation and Sales Integrations
One of the earliest steps in the sales process, lead generation seeks to transition early-stage leads into delighted customers. Syncing lead information to HubSpot allows users to easily view their information throughout the buyer’s journey. You can collect this information via a handful of integrations. 

A SurveyMonkey integration allows you to create and distribute surveys to prospects and customers, collect data from the surveys, and review responses in HubSpot. From there, you can segment contacts based on their responses to manage the type of content that would be most useful to them. 

The WordPress integration aligns your WordPress site with contact data and business goals stored in HubSpot. Powered with HubSpot growth tools, your WordPress can more effectively attract, engage, and delight website visitors and customers. The best part? You can access data in both WordPress and HubSpot. 

Data silos between your marketing and sales teams easily create missed opportunities for converting leads. A Salesforce integration empowers sales teams with valuable data that helps them prioritize leads to pursue, save time, build more meaningful relationships, and close more deals. 
Social Media Integrations
Social media marketing is a major section of overall marketing campaigns. With social media integrations, you can learn more about your followers, understand what type of content is most relevant to them, and automate specific parts of your strategy. At a minimum, you should integrate Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter with your HubSpot CRM.
Video Integrations
With video becoming a major part of marketing campaigns, it’s essential to use integrations that easily create and implement videos into websites and measure the success of video marketing campaigns. 

A Vidyard integration makes it easy to add video to marketing efforts and track viewer engagement in HubSpot. Based on who is most engaged with content, you can build segmented lists, score leads, and enroll contacts in automated workflows. From there, create custom reports and dashboards in HubSpot that show information on the impact of video content on your business. 

By connecting YouTube with HubSpot, you can easily find performance data on your videos and channel success, and you can compare this data with other video and social media platforms with HubSpot’s analytics, tools, and dashboards. 
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 6
					When Are Custom Integrations Necessary?
					As we mentioned before, ours is not a comprehensive list of integrations. However, if you’re searching for an integration in the HubSpot Applications Marketplace and can’t find what you need, you might require a custom integration.
				
				
			

			
				
					As we mentioned before, ours is not a comprehensive list of integrations. However, if you’re searching for an integration in the HubSpot Applications Marketplace and can’t find what you need, you might require a custom integration.
A custom integration is a standard integration, either created by the HubSpot Marketplace or a third-party application, that doesn’t have an integration available with HubSpot.

Certain products, such as Zapier or Heroku, are iPaaS solutions that build a custom integration or run code to create the integration. However, these solutions are only recommended if you’re unable to work with a team of developers and integration specialists.

Integrations are primarily used for connecting systems to applications in order to move data around, but custom integrations do far more. They’re tailored to a specific business need instead of a generic one-size-fits-all use case. 

Some of our clients at SmartBug Media® require solutions instead of integrations. A solution goes beyond moving data and accomplishes a client’s business case, transforms data, associates the data with other objects that exist in one application but not in the software (or vice-versa), and so much more. In other words, a solution is tailor-made to directly address the exact needs of a business.

					Chapter 1
					How to Determine Your Company’s Attribution Reporting Readiness
					Ready to drill down into your company’s attribution reporting readiness, and nail down exactly what attribution reporting is? Here’s what you can learn from attribution reports. 
				
				
			

			
				
					Basically, attribution reporting is a way of tracking the content and marketing channels that are leading to conversions and sales. Marketing attribution lights up the path your leads and customers walk along as they saunter through the Buyer’s Journey. For marketers, attribution reporting can prove ROI, highlight channels that are driving conversions, and illuminate dead efforts that are worth cutting off. 

How mature is your company’s attribution reporting setup?
As critical as attribution reporting is to marketing initiatives, no two companies will be equally equipped to capture the same information—and attribution reporting comes in all shapes and sizes. The maturity of your company’s multi-touch attribution reporting abilities will dictate how you’ll want to move forward. 
Here’s how to determine your company’s attribution reporting maturity level:

Low maturity
Moderate maturity
High maturity
Overly complicated

Low Maturity
If your company is just starting to kick off marketing attribution reporting, it probably falls in the low-maturity category. In this stage, your team might use basic tools such as Google Analytics and out-of-the-box reporting. You might also be tracking closed customers back to your analytic platform. However, if you’re at a low level of maturity, the company probably isn’t tracking many sales touchpoints along the way. 
Moderate Maturity
Companies with moderate attribution reporting usually have tracking codes laid out for the most important offline and online interactions. You may have stepped past simple, out-of-the-box tracking and set up reports for some touchpoints. You might also be using your customer relationship management (CRM) tool or other technology to completely track your marketing and sales funnel. However, at this stage, you probably have gaps that don’t cover offline interactions or data from your sales software. 
High Maturity
Marketing teams with high reporting attribution maturity track the full scope of both online and offline activity. At this stage, you’re measuring and building attribution reports on all of your interactions. It also means your marketing and sales teams are completely on the same page when it comes to tracking actions and goals. 
Overly Complicated
More tracking doesn’t necessarily equal more mature attribution reporting. Many companies, especially enterprises with siloed departments, will have an abundance of tracking codes and little idea what they’re for. These teams may be tracking interactions, but they’re tangled, messy, and not feeding into clear reporting. 
What technology will enhance your multi-touch attribution?
There is technology that can simplify your multi-touch attribution efforts and lift the burden off your marketers. Here are a few helpful tools and some technology to simplify your attribution efforts:

LeadsRX is fairly straightforward and includes simple installation. That makes it especially useful for small and mid-sized businesses that need to simplify their multi-touch attribution reporting. Once the tool is set up, you unlock several attribution tools, including the following:

Analytics data
Customer journey mapping
Segmentation

As a whole, LeadsRX is a sturdy addition for both B2B and B2C marketers who want to streamline their marketing attribution efforts.

Terminus is best known as a tool for B2B marketers, but it also includes dashboards that present numbers in an easy-to-understand layout. A big advantage of Terminus is that it’s built with a range of integrations so you can easily weave an unbroken web within your tech stack. Some popular integrations include:

Salesforce
HubSpot
Marketo
Bombora

Terminus is also well known for its customer support features, and the company even offers training programs. 

CAKE is a versatile tool, crafted for businesses of all sizes. Although it doesn’t include audience segmentation, it does lay out handy tracking features, such as cross-channel attribution reporting and ROI tracking. CAKE is another company known for stellar support. It offers 24/7 customer service, as well as in-person training options.

					The success of your attribution reporting depends on how well your team can line up marketing goals with crisp reporting. First, that means your company needs to pick the right attribution model to accomplish your goals. 
Wondering what models are available? Here are some popular attribution models:

First touch
Last touch
50/50
Time decay
Linear
U-shaped
W-shaped

First Touch
In first-touch attribution models, you weigh the credit fully on that first-touch interaction. This is especially useful for companies that are trying to discover which content is pulling in leads. Because it shows you what channels and content is capturing the most attention, first-touch models can reveal which areas are producing leads and which efforts are worth ditching. 
Last Touch
In last-touch attribution models, all of the credit goes to the last touchpoint your prospect hits before they are converted. Implementing the last-touch model is a great way to shed light on what is inspiring customers to act. This model is especially helpful for companies that are churning out plenty of leads but having a tough time turning those leads into conversions. Because you can pinpoint that last contact point, last-touch models make it easy to see which strategies and channels are pushing contacts along, and which ones are failing to convert.
50/50
To set up a 50/50 attribution model, you’ll want to divide credit evenly between your first touchpoint and the last touchpoint that comes before lead creation. Essentially, this model weighs your attention-grabbing step and action step evenly. That makes it easier to gauge your marketing efforts on a broader scale. 
Time Decay
Time decay models divvy credit up among all of your touchpoints along the customer journey or your conversion path. As the name suggests, this model gives more weight to those touchpoints closest to a sale. This is a good model if you have a solid lead generation engine but are having a tough time pushing leads down the funnel. When it comes to the Buyer’s Journey, a time decay model is built to identify prospects in the consideration and conversion stages.
Linear
In a linear model, you divvy credit up evenly along all of your touchpoints. This is a handy model when you want to set goals and boost transparency. It reveals the channels or interactions that contribute to a sale that may otherwise be overlooked. 
U-Shaped
In a u-shaped model, 80 percent of credit is divided equally between your first touch and lead creation. The rest of your credit goes to all of those touchpoints that fall between those two milestones. This model is best for measuring lead generation attribution.
W-Shaped
When your attribution reporting is w-shaped, you divide credit evenly between three touchpoints: first touch, lead creation, and qualified lead. Because it’s stretched evenly across milestones, this model illuminates the broader story of your campaigns.
How should you choose the right attribution model for your company?



When it comes to picking the right marketing attribution reporting method for your company, there isn’t a cookie-cutter solution. In some cases, you may want to mix and match several models based on your buyer personas and the Buyer’s Journey. 
Above all else, your attribution model should fit your goals, capitalize on your current marketing strengths, and fill in any reporting gaps. Here are some questions to help you pick out the right attribution model for your business: 

What is the biggest weakness in our current marketing attribution program?
What are our biggest strengths?
Which resources have sparked the most leads?
Which channels are leading to the most sales?
What areas of our funnel need extra attention?

By digging into your current strengths, weaknesses, and goals, you’ll be able to line your needs up with the model or models that reveal everything you need to fuel the best marketing attribution reporting. 
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 3
					How to Boost Your Attribution Campaigns in Every Marketing Program
					Now you know what attribution models to use, here’s how to start reporting in your favorite marketing platforms.
				
				
			

			
				
					Today’s marketers have a massive selection of tools at their disposal. Unfortunately, each marketing platform comes with its own set of best practices, features, and benefits. If you want to get the most out of your attribution campaign, you need to know how to use the platforms your company has on hand. Here’s a quick guide to marketing attribution in popular marketing programs:

HubSpot
HubSpot has built-in functions made specifically to boost your marketing attribution reporting capabilities. In fact, HubSpot has two separate types of multi-touch attribution reports: multi-touch contact attribution and multi-touch revenue attribution. 
Wondering how HubSpot’s multi-touch reports are set up? Here are the touchpoints HubSpot’s reporting hinges on:

First interaction
Lead creation
Deal creation
Closed-won

You’ll also have access to multi-touch revenue attribution reporting within HubSpot. This lays out the touchpoints that influence a closed deal. These reports are based on the following:

Interaction source
Content type
Deal type
Campaign
And other dimensions

In order to set up your attribution reporting in HubSpot, you’ll need access to its Marketing Hub Enterprise, Customer Reporting, and Sales Hub. 

Marketo
Marketo is another powerful platform that can boost your team’s attribution reporting success. Marketo gives users three different choices of attribution modes:

Explicit: This will only count those contact roles that are connected to opportunities. 
Hybrid: When you set up hybrid mode, it will start by searching for a contact role on an opportunity. If it doesn’t find any, it searches for the opportunity company. From there, it will track all your account contacts and lay out their influence. 
Implicit: This mode starts by examining the opportunity company. Next, it will track down account contacts and measure their influence. 

When you’re building your Marketo reporting, there are three important best practices to guide your actions:

Match channels to success steps: Before you do anything else, you’ll want to assign every channel you have to a success step. 
Match users to programs: Be sure that all of your users are added to the corresponding Marketo program.
Attach opportunities to contacts: Be sure to attach an appropriate opportunity to your contact. Otherwise, Marketo won’t be able to assign your first-touch or multi-touch attribution accurately. 


Bizible
Bizible is best known for its Google Ads for Salesforce replacement feature, but it has become a force in the B2B campaign world recently—and it’s connected to both Adobe and Marketo. Bizible provides six different multi-touch attribution models:

First touch
Last touch
Full path
W-shaped
U-shaped
Custom

It’s important to note that Bizible is made for enterprise-level businesses. It’s set up to cater to account-based marketing (ABM) campaigns, it includes advanced closed-loop reporting functions, and it features high-level dashboards.

Salesforce
Salesforce is less known for its marketing reporting, but it’s still both powerful and flexible. It offers several out-of-the-box options for marketers who want to map out attribution reporting. 
Here are a few of the key reporting features Salesforce offers:

Opportunity lead source: This clear drop-down system makes it easy to see the source your lead came from when they were pulled into your system. This helps you pinpoint a customer or prospect’s key touchpoints and actions. 
Urchin tracking module (UTM) tracking: UTM tracking lets you tag your URLs with small descriptive snippets. That way, you can see the sources, campaigns, and other details describing where your traffic is coming from.
Salesforce campaigns: With Salesforce campaigns, you’ll see who has been hit with marketing messages and how they’re reacting.


LeanData
LeanData is a solid option if you want to link up Salesforce accounts and pin down campaign attribution reports. As a whole, there are three key features to take advantage of when using LeanData to build marketing attribution campaigns:

Campaign Influence Wizard: Within LeanData’s Campaign Influence Wizard, you can control fields, filter objects, and set up custom models to direct your attribution efforts. You can also feed Salesforce data into your tool, and that info will run natively in Salesforce.
Opportunity View: With the Opportunity View feature, you can track your prospect and customer’s interactions. This makes it easy to follow leads as they wander across different opportunity levels.
Campaign View: Use Campaign View to dive into the individual touches a person makes on the Buyer’s Journey. This feature lets you report on impressions from different campaigns and channels. 

Google and Paid Media
When it comes to paid ads, clear attribution reporting plays a key role. By mastering your attribution efforts in programs like Google Ads, YouTube, and Facebook, you can prove ROI and see where your investments are paying off. Here’s an overview of attribution reporting on these different paid platforms.

Google Ads
Google Ads is one of the most popular paid platforms out there. When it comes to tracking activity, Google’s attribution is session-based. It uses cookies to track conversions and touchpoints. Google gives you several options when it comes to attribution reporting, including First Click, Last Click, Time Decay, Linear, Position Based, and Data-Driven.

YouTube
Google Ads now lets you use YouTube to track attribution reporting. YouTube uses a data-driven model that measures clicks as well as video engagements. You can also use YouTube attribution to measure how well ads run and how they relate to search campaigns.

Facebook
Unlike Google, Facebook only tracks activity when users are logged in. That means they’ll be measured differently from Google’s session-based reporting. As a default, Facebook provides a last-touch attribution model. However, default reporting is restricted to a 28-day window. Within Facebook’s attribution reporting, you have the option of tracking performance reporting along everything from organic and paid interactions to direct interactions. You can also track custom reports by group or access cross-device reporting.

					Online vs. Offline Reporting: What’s Best for Your Company? 
					Masters of attribution can bridge every gap in their reporting. Here’s the difference between online and offline reports, and how to track your prospects’ every step.
				
				
			

			
				
					In today’s marketing world, your customers will certainly be interacting online. After all, more than four billion people are now actively surfing the web. However, many companies still have offline marketing interactions that you’ll want to track and credit. 
The key is striking the right balance between reporting on all of your offline and online marketing interactions. The first step is understanding each piece of your marketing puzzle and how both online and offline reporting fits into your company’s goals.

What is online marketing attribution reporting?
Online marketing attribution includes your company’s website, along with all of those digital touchpoints that carry leads through an online path. Here are a few examples of online marketing touchpoints:

Blogs
Case studies
Social media posts
Online ads


What is offline marketing attribution reporting?
Offline marketing attribution reporting analyzes the interactions and actions your potential customers take offline. There may be more offline marketing touchpoints built into your operation than you realize. Here are some common offline attribution paths:

Point-of-sale data
Foot traffic
Tradeshow and event traffic
Panel data and source matching

Again, the data should guide your efforts. In order to get the most out of your marketing attribution reporting and boost marketing and sales alignment, make sure your company is fully covered. Start by identifying all of your online and offline marketing and sales sources. From there, examine your marketing goals, choose the right attribution model to boost your efforts, and bridge the gap between online and offline reporting. 
Once your marketing team has a steady stream of attribution reporting flowing in across online and offline sources, you’ll have what you need to capture more leads, prove ROI, and drive more sales. 
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 5
					Conclusion
					Your company’s journey towards excellent attribution reporting starts with a hard look at your current marketing strengths, weaknesses, and capabilities.
				
				
			

			
				
					The more time your team spends perfecting your attribution reporting, the easier it will be to capture leads, convert them, and drive more sales. The best attribution reporting plan will help you align the vision of your whole team. By refining your marketing attribution plan, you’ll lay the groundwork for a more unified company, build out more wide-sweeping support, and pave a clear path toward your team’s marketing goals.
When you unlock clean, efficient attribution reporting, you’ll be able to:

Prove marketing ROI
Pull in more buy-in and resources from stakeholders
Patch the holes in your marketing funnel
Capitalize on the strengths of your current marketing strategy
Drive more leads to your site

        Discovery & Audit
        
        
          We get to know your business and tech stack inside and out so we can make the best integration recommendations based on your needs. We start by looking under the hood at your internal systems, gathering critical information to create your business requirements and mapping documents.

        Integrations Build
        
        
          Our internal teams crafts a customized integration solution. Our experts meticulously map out data flows to ensure that all components work in harmony, creating a solution that fits seamlessly into your existing systems. Integrations can be designed to be bilateral—where data flows back and forth between systems, allowing each to influence the other—or unilateral—where one system provides information to the other without receiving data in return.
        
      
    
    
    
      
        
        
        
        
      
      
        3
        
        Authority System
        
        
          In any integration scenario, it's crucial to identify which system will act as the authority or source of truth. For example, if integrating Salesforce and HubSpot, we help you determine whether Salesforce or HubSpot will be the primary system where data discrepancies are resolved. This ensures consistency and clarity across all integrated systems, guiding users to the correct data source and maintaining accuracy.

        User Acceptance Testing
        
        
          Before going live, we conduct a detailed demo and perform extensive testing and quality assurance. This ensures that every aspect of the integration meets the highest standards of performance and reliability.

			Our current systems did not cleanly integrate with each other. There were attempts made to integrate them, but it never seemed to work. ... The main issue I'd say was [not being able to access] the full story from a lead to an opportunity to a sale.

					Chapter 1
					Introduction to HubSpot and Salesforce Integration
					As marketing and sales teams become more and more integrated, they are recognizing the need to resolve friction when they work in different systems. 
				
				
			

			
				
					The Salesforce integration is one of the most popular integrations in HubSpot’s App Marketplace. Salesforce has been around for several decades, and many sales teams rely on its data. As marketing and sales teams become more and more integrated, they are recognizing the need to resolve friction when they work in different systems. 
In many companies, the sales team uses Salesforce and the marketing team uses HubSpot. This separation can lead to siloed data, making it difficult to see how clients’ marketing and sales efforts are performing. With the Salesforce integration, both systems are connected so that users can access critical data from both systems.
Depending on your needs, a HubSpot and Salesforce integration will lead to:

Better-aligned sales and marketing teams
Improved reporting
Successful performance of complex actions in both systems

This guide provides a basic breakdown of the HubSpot-Salesforce integration journey, starting with the prerequisites for integration, followed by the process for properly connecting the two systems, and finally common errors (and resolutions!) that occur during most integrations.

					Preparation is key to the success of your integration. During this stage, you are determining the rules of moving the data back and forth between the two systems.
You have two options:

Sync everything between the two systems (the easiest option)
Sync a subset of contacts between HubSpot to Salesforce

Ultimately, your three main data pools come from: 

Companies (HubSpot) —> Accounts (Salesforce)
Contacts (HubSpot) —> Contacts and Leads (Salesforce)
Deals (HubSpot) —> Opportunities (Salesforce)

Rarely do two integrations look exactly alike, so the more clearly you can determine the rules of moving the data, the easier it will be. Keep in mind that errors will happen, regardless of how much you prepare; this is just part of the gig. We’ll get more into resolving those errors later on. 
1. Work with Your Team on an Integration Mapping Document
Before you do anything else, work on an integration mapping document with your sales and marketing teams who know the data best. Your ultimate rulebook of data movement, this document outlines:

HubSpot properties and property types and Salesforce fields and field types to sync them to for Contacts, Companies, Deals, and Activities
Whether data should sync both ways, not sync, prefer Salesforce unless blank, or always prefer Salesforce
Custom objects and their fields in Salesforce that will sync one-way to HubSpot

The primary goal here is to fill out all of the fields and identify the sync settings for each before starting the migration. Additional rows should be added for any custom properties.
If you’re starting an integration mapping document from scratch, take a look at the one we use at SmartBug to get started! 
2. Create an Integration User (or Request a Salesforce Admin User from Your IT Team) 
As soon as you start working on the mapping document, request that your IT department create a Salesforce user specifically for the integration that has administrative access. (If you have administrative access to Salesforce, you can create the integration user yourself.) You might not believe it, but getting an integration user for Salesforce with admin access is often one of the longest tasks in the integration project.
The username (i.e., email address) of the integration user does not matter, but make sure that the mobile phone is yours so that you receive the verification code when setting up the integration.
We highly recommend not using a person’s Salesforce account as the integration user because the integration will break when the person leaves the company, changes their password, or moves departments. The integration user should be a dedicated account in Salesforce.
3. Conduct the Kick-Off Call(s) with Your Teams
Conducting a kick-off call (or calls) provides the opportunity for your marketing, sales, and sometimes even operations teams to get aligned. Your kick-off call should encourage discussion rather than simple yes or no responses, so expect this meeting to be anywhere between an hour and an hour and a half.
Make sure all relevant marketing and sales leaders and your Salesforce administrator are in attendance. You’ll get better, more direct answers in less time.
During the meeting, make sure to discuss:

Goals. Clearly state the goal of the project and the benefits to both teams in integrating the data.
Project timeline. After outlining a feasible timeline, determine if the deadline is hard and fast.
Mapping document. This document does not need to be completed before the kickoff call. The call is a good opportunity to discuss questions and concerns about the document.
Who will use what system. Though most marketing team members will not need a Salesforce login, we do recommend each sales team member have a HubSpot user account (you can give them a free marketing seat). This is so that they can see the Visualforce component in Salesforce with HubSpot contact activity.
Where reporting occurs. Although sales reporting often happens in Salesforce and marketing reporting in HubSpot, if you are looking for attribution reporting, we recommend using HubSpot. This requires Opportunities to be synched with Deals in HubSpot.
Leads and/or contacts. Determine if you will be synching both leads and contacts in Salesforce to HubSpot as well as if HubSpot should be creating new leads or contacts in Salesforce.
External applications and integration. If you have any third-party software integrated with Salesforce (such as ZoomInfo or Drift), talk through whether this will automatically bring data to HubSpot or if you need to integrate it there as well.
Whether all Salesforce contacts should be marketing contacts. This will depend on if you have room in your number of marketing contacts in your HubSpot subscription. Remember: Salesforce charges according to the number of users; HubSpot charges according to the number of marketing contacts. You can store extra contacts in HubSpot and mark them as non-marketing.
Long-term support. Determine the point person for the integration after setup. This role might be you or your IT team (if your company has one). 

4. Clear Space in Your Schedule
A typical integration takes about 20 hours, including a few hours of watching for extra sync errors after setup. However, these 20 hours are usually spread out over the course of a month or longer. In most cases, the integration takes longer than a month, but the pace of the project is based on how quickly you: 

Finish the mapping document
Obtain a Salesforce admin login for the integration user
Resolve integration sync errors

Be sure to leave enough time to test the integration. You’ll want to do everything from “create a contact in HubSpot, make sure it’s a lead in Salesforce” type of testing to making sure any lead routing and automations are running correctly.
Before the integration begins, prepare yourself for a whole lot of errors at first. This is typical and shouldn’t cause a panic. No database is perfect and no database is 100 percent clean.
Finally, almost every decision made during the kick-off call can be changed or updated in the integration settings, so don’t feel as though anything is set in stone!

					How to Properly Connect the Two Systems
					As soon as you have completed the preliminary steps, it’s time to connect the two systems!
				
				
			

			
				
					As soon as you have completed the preliminary steps, it’s time to connect the two systems! 
Step One: Completing the HubSpot Install
In HubSpot, go to the App Marketplace and search for Salesforce. It should be the first result with the Salesforce cloud logo. After you click “Install app,” a new page will instruct you to begin the integration.
Step Two: Navigating Through the Integration Setup
The integration setup requires a series of small steps: 

The first page will ask you to log into Salesforce. If you are testing in a sandbox environment (a copy of your organization’s data in a separate database that you can use for testing and training), you can check the box.
After clicking “Allow” for the “Allow access” pop-up, start the app installation process. You will have to log in again.
Click “Install for All Users.”
Click “Yes, grant access to these third-party web sites” and then “Continue.”
The installation process may take a few minutes.
You can add the Visualforce component to the page layouts in Salesforce now, but it’s not a necessity for integration (you can also do this later).
Before finishing the setup and syncing, you will get a chance to review the sync settings one last time.

Step Three: Choosing HubSpot Sync Settings
Once you have the app installed in HubSpot, you’ll need to go to the Sync Settings tab to update the HubSpot to Salesforce and Salesforce to HubSpot settings.
You get here by going to “Settings” -> “Integrations” -> “Connected Apps” -> “Salesforce.”
Here you can set:

The inclusion list (defines which contacts in HubSpot should sync with Salesforce)
Whether a new HubSpot contact gets created as a lead or contact in Salesforce
If the state/country values are picklists or not
If a new Salesforce contact/lead creates a new record in HubSpot
If a contact’s lifecycle stage changes in Salesforce updates the lifecycle stage in HubSpot
If needed, switch out or reconnect the integration user

Step Four: Identifying Mappings
You can identify your field mappings during the setup (step two above), or you can do it in the settings after the two systems are integrated.
All standard fields will be mapped automatically, but now you will want to pull out your Integration Mapping Document to ensure all fields’ sync rules are set up to match your document. You will also want to add any custom field mappings per your document.
Look for the following:

Are all standard and custom fields identified in the Integration Mapping Document included for Contacts, Companies, and Deals?
Are the sync rules correct?
Is HubSpot showing a red error (issue) or yellow error (warning) on any of the mappings?

You will likely need to add a new mapping. To do so:

Go to the tab where you want to add a new mapping (Contacts, Companies, or Deals).
Click “Add new mapping.”
Choose the HubSpot property you want to map (or create a property in the window).
Choose the Salesforce field you want to map to.
Choose the sync rule (2-way, don’t sync, prefer Salesforce, or always use Salesforce).
Choose whether you want to sync the field now or gradually. If you’re close to hitting your API limit, choose gradually. Otherwise, it’s fine to sync now.
Click “Save”!

Step Five: Importing Information
Once the integration is complete, you may want to see the Salesforce information immediately. (We all get impatient sometimes!) You can do so by going to “Import and Export” in HubSpot:

Go to Settings.
Click “Import & Export.”
Click the “Go to import” button.
Click the “Start an import” button.
Select “Integrations,” then “Salesforce records,” then “Standard Objects.”
From there, you can select specific objects or “everything.”

If you skip the above steps to force the data to import from Salesforce now, the Salesforce information will trickle in based on records being updated in Salesforce. 
				
			

			

		
		
		

			
				
					Chapter 4
					Addressing Common Integration Errors
					We wish this wasn’t the case, but errors are very common in a HubSpot and Salesforce integration. You might as well consider them part of the process.
				
				
			

			
				
					We wish this wasn’t the case, but errors are very common in a HubSpot and Salesforce integration. You might as well consider them part of the process.
Luckily, as common as they are, errors are relatively easy to fix. In our experience, here are some of the most common errors that you can expect to see:
1. Associations
Association errors happen when a record in Salesforce is associated with another record (usually a contact or company) that is not in HubSpot. This most commonly occurs when you are using selective sync and the opportunity in Salesforce is associated with a contact that isn’t part of the sync and thus is not in HubSpot. Then the opportunity (i.e., deal in HubSpot) won’t sync at all.
The easiest way to fix this is to import all records and then try to resync. 
2. Custom Code
A custom code error is usually caused by a Salesforce validation rule, automation, or flow preventing the sync.
To fix validation rule errors, you should: 

Update the HubSpot record to fit within those rules (best solution).
Update the Salesforce validation rules to ignore the integration user (not recommended because the data will be less clean).
Update the HubSpot inclusion list to exclude records with missing information (not recommended if those contacts should sync otherwise).

To fix automation or flow errors, click into the Custom Code error to find the details to send to your Salesforce Admin to fix.
3. Duplicates
Although HubSpot automatically de-duplicates based on email, Salesforce does not, which means if duplicate emails are found in Salesforce, HubSpot will show this error.
To fix the error:

Merge the records in Salesforce.
Change the emails in Salesforce.
Separate out contacts in HubSpot.

4. Permissions
Permission errors often occur because the Salesforce integration user does not have the necessary access to view, edit, or create a record. This will most likely happen for any selective sync integration users or a user who does not have full admin rights in Salesforce.
To fix the error, update the Salesforce permissions or field access.
This error can also occur when there is a reference field issue (called a lookup field) in Salesforce. This happens when a lookup field in Salesforce is deleted, any of the children are deleted, or if there are limited permissions around that lookup object but not the actual record itself.
Update the property type in HubSpot to be a drop-down select.
5. Picklists
A picklist error occurs when the picklist values between the two systems do not match or the Salesforce record owner is either not in HubSpot or they are inactive.
To fix this error:

For non-matching values, update either the HubSpot property or the Salesforce field to have the missing values.
For Salesforce owners, either import active Salesforce users into HubSpot as free marketing users or reassign the records in Salesforce to active users.

6. Field Mappings
Field mapping errors occur because the property/field mappings are not compatible or the property/field no longer exists.
For field mapping sync settings, HubSpot color codes the status of the sync:

Green means you’re good to go!
Orange is most likely warning you that a property is mapped to multiple fields. Sometimes this is intentional, such as mapping the address in HubSpot to both the shipping and billing address fields in Salesforce. This warning also indicates a missing drop-down value for you to fix.
Red is an issue and usually means that either the integration user is missing the correct permissions or the field is deleted in Salesforce.

To fix the error:

Update the property/field type to a more compatible format.
Re-map the property/field to another property/field.
Delete the property/field mapping.

7. Property Values
Property value errors occur because the property value is not valid. This often occurs when an email address in Salesforce is invalid, usually because of a typo in an email address. 
To fix this error: 

Update the email address in Salesforce. 

8. Other Sync Errors
Other sync errors are much harder to diagnose. Luckily, HubSpot will usually list a reason for an error. If the error isn’t listed, try Google to see if someone out there has an answer, wait out the error (as long as it doesn’t affect real data), or loop in your IT team for help.
9. Visualforce Issues
A common complaint you might get is that sales team members can’t see the Visualforce component with HubSpot data or they can’t see any data in the component on the contact record.
To troubleshoot: 

Check the users’ browsers to see if they have cleared their cookies. If they’re using Chrome or Edge, it could be an extension on their browser that’s blocking the Visualforce component. Safari sometimes has more issues than the other two browsers, so switching to Chrome or Edge may be the answer.
Make sure that they are clicking “Remember Me” when logging into HubSpot. Users have to be logged into both platforms to see the data.
If your Salesforce users are not also HubSpot users, you can import active Salesforce users into HubSpot so they can see the component. They need a minimum of “Contacts View Access” in HubSpot.
Have your Salesforce Admin ensure that those team member profiles in Salesforce have access to the HubSpot app. (When starting the app installation, did you accidentally install for select profiles instead of all users?)

					Embrace the Iterative Process
					Although no integration will ever look the same as another, you can follow this process to ensure you reduce as much friction as possible.
				
				
			

			
				
					As you’ve read, integrating HubSpot and Salesforce is a process that requires patience, curiosity, and very clear lines of communication. Although no integration will ever look the same as another, you can follow this process to ensure you reduce as much friction as possible.

					Targeting Audiences

					Messaging & Branding
					
						Then, we'll start crafting cohesive messaging across your campaigns and encourage users to take action. What do you want people to do? Whether that's filling out a form, scheduling a demo, or requesting a quote, defining your CTAs sets the foundation for ad copy, website copy, and landing pages.

						After that, you'll begin to leverage smart bidding as one more strategy to maximize the outcomes of your next PPC campaign. We'll work with you to make thoughtful decisions about when and how to execute your smart bidding and ensure that the ad platform receives the proper conversion data. Then, we'll work behind the scenes to get you ahead of the competition by optimizing campaign settings, ad copy, keywords, and landing page(s) to get the desired results.

        SmartBug allowed me to push the limits of working remotely by letting me work on the road for several months. It was truly incredible! Gaspésie, New York, New Orleans, Grand Canyon, Las Vegas, Yellowstone and the list goes on... It's a unique experience to code from the middle of a desert with the support of your colleagues.

        Overview

        A global hyperautomation team benefited from a creative inbound approach, using QR codes and completing forms through HubSpot landing pages at an in-person event to drive MQLs.

          Background
        
        Hosted by UiPath, the FORWARD 5 Conference is one of the largest gatherings, celebrations, and “academies” in the automation industry.

Here, attendees gain the skills they need to advance their business operations, find sources of information to fuel transformation, and connect with like-minded innovators driving automation forward. 

Ashling Partners—one of the largest intelligent automation (IA) service providers in North America—reached out to the SmartBug team to help them make a mark on the conference, increase MQL numbers from the previous year, and contribute to their MQL goal for the second half of the current year. 

“We knew we had an aggressive goal of new leads and were going to need an omnichannel approach to hitting that goal.” – Don Sweeney, co-Founder
      
    

    

    
      
        
        

        
          
            The Problem
          
          Moving Beyond Business Cards in a Fish Bowl
Having experienced lower-than-expected booth visitor rates at the previous year’s conference, Ashling Partners needed a solution to draw in more leads with potentially excellent matches (considering the organizations in attendance). We also saw this as an excellent opportunity to contribute to our goal of MQLs for July-December of that year.

We were aware of three key attributes:

Many other organizations were going to be using outdated contact collection approaches
95-99% of visitors would be on mobile devices
We couldn’t use a significant number of props according to conference rules

So we decided to create a digital overlay on an in-person event.

          
            
              
                
                  
                
                
              
              
                “Having a digital aspect to an in-person event would facilitate strong email delivery and engagement rates after the event concluded

          OUR SOLUTION
        
        Automation Around the World
We locked in on an interactive “experience” through the world of automation called Automation Around the World. Conference-goers checked in at different Ashling Partners events to get four passport stamps by scanning a QR code to enter to win “Two Tickets to Paradise” (two flights to the Caribbean).

To get fast-tracked to all four stamps, users could stop by and scan the QR code at their main booth (“Base Camp”).

As soon as an attendee checked in from a QR code, the journey primarily took place in HubSpot’s Marketing Hub:

First, they were taken to a HubSpot landing page to complete a form. Every page was mobile-optimized and included travel-themed Lottie animations.
From there, they were put into a workflow which increased a custom property (Passport Stamp) to notate how many check-ins they had, then deployed the correct email aligned with one of the four stamps. Each email included a GIF of the number of stamps stamping the guest’s passport.
Finally, the thank you message after the initial form submission took the user to a “Upgrade to First Class” page that allowed them to self-select that they want a personalized demo of Ashling Partners’ tools and skills after the event.

“The last-minute change to have contacts upgrade to first class worked out well. We were able to highlight to our sales team the first contacts to prioritize reaching out to following the event.” – Mike DeLeonardis, Chief Growth Officer.


 
      
    

    

    
      
        
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        The Results
        
        
        
        Shooting Far Beyond Our Goals
Over the course of the four-day conference, we saw the following numbers:

Ashling Partners gained 183 NEW MQLs from the conference.
89 people stopped by the Ashling Partners main booth and scanned in or provided their contact information through a participant badge scan.
18 people “upgraded to first class” by requesting a personalized demo after the event.
164 people checked into Ashling Partners’ off-site event, PALOOZA, on the first night of the conference.

All in all, Ashling Partners had one of the busiest showings of the conference when it came to the number of people engaging at Base Camp and their breakout-style sessions. Not only did they far exceed their expected numbers at the conference, but they also made a major dent in their overall MQL goals for the second half of the year. 

“The strong showing at FORWARD 5 helps us refine our marketing approach for [the upcoming year] and beyond. We are thrilled to continue our partnership with SmartBug and continue the momentum from this event.” – Marshall Sied, co-Founder.

                            From start to finish, SmartBug Media was absolutely amazing. We migrated our CRM from Salesforce and had quite a few custom items we wanted built and SmartBug replicated what we were wanting. Our main point of contact, Mike Wolfe, was very professional and knowledgeable about HubSpot and worked very hard to set up our CRM to our expectations and standards.

        Generate Quotes.
Simplify the way your sales team handles CPQ by using line items, products, and SKUs to generate standard or customized quotes. Not sure where to get started?

From there, we design and create your quote template and provide training on quotes best practices, allowing your team to easily associate the quotes with contacts, companies, or deals.

When you work with SmartBug Media in HubSpot’s Commerce Hub, you can distribute and execute your quotes all within one platform.

                            Decided to take a chance and go with HubSpot's No. 1 partner. The SmartBug team not only delivered great results but working with them couldn't have been easier.

                            As the manager of over 70 providers in the HubSpot Service Marketplace, SmartBug Media managed to stand out above the rest in several ways—no small feat.

                            From start to finish, SmartBug Media was absolutely amazing. We migrated our CRM from Salesforce and had quite a few custom items we wanted built and SmartBug replicated what we were wanting. Our main point of contact, Mike Wolfe, was very professional and knowledgeable about HubSpot and worked very hard to set up our CRM to our expectations and standards.

                            After two websites, a lot of inbound marketing work, and a HubSpot management program for one of our portfolio sites, it's clear that SmartBug Media knows what they're doing.

          Background
        
        California Olive Ranch (COR) is the largest grower of olives for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) in California, and its namesake brand is the third largest EVOO brand in the US retail market. Striving for continued growth, CEO Michael Fox wanted to revamp the company’s online marketing efforts with a new website and enhanced marketing capability.
Over the years, COR had built a good email database, but Fox felt the company wasn’t leveraging the list effectively and believed the company could elevate its messaging and design.  To help optimize the growth potential of email and SMS in a meaningful way, Fox and his leadership team chose to partner with SmartBug. 
“We needed to leverage data to better understand our customers, to know when and how to engage with them,” he said. “We needed to rebrand with more upscale designs, and because we are a young company, maintaining a modern look and feel for our brand is integral to our growth and success.”
      
    

    

    
      
        
        

        
          
            The Problem
          
          In need of Support Leveraging the Power and Possibility of Email Marketing
The company needed a fresh perspective to harness the possibilities of content marketing—email and SMS messaging, specifically.
Fox and his team recognized they needed a targeted, more intentional approach. They wanted to move beyond sales messaging with new strategies to engage customers in greater numbers and in a more purposeful way. 
“We were massively underutilizing email,” Fox said. “We needed to upgrade and modernize our workflows and improve segmentation to follow a clear strategy for specific campaigns to drive conversions and build the brand.”

          OUR SOLUTION
        
        Using Klaviyo to Segment and Microsegment for Comprehensive Email & SMS Campaigns
When Fox and his team first started working with SmartBug, they were afraid of over-communicating, a direct result of not segmenting their audiences. By using the full capabilities of the Klaviyo platform, SmartBug focused first on:

Email and SMS content & segmentation
Email and SMS flow improvements
Email and SMS list growth

SmartBug added new pop-up collection forms to the website to capture and continue growing its email and SMS subscriber lists; built all new email and SMS flow content and design strategies; implemented SMART testing to send campaigns for more accurate data about open and click-through rates; and segmented lists for product launches, holiday campaigns, and more.

The company’s welcome series was also redesigned to incorporate more information about the brand’s story, mission, and unique product offerings to educate customers and incentivize their first purchase with a special introductory offer.
      
    

    

    
      
        
          
            
              
                
                  
                
                
                  
                
              
              
                
              
              
                
                  
                
                
                  
                
              
            
          
        
      
    

    

    
      
        The Results
        
        
        
        Leveraging targeted and segmented email marketing and SMS
Leveraging targeted and segmented email marketing and SMS messaging helped the company see revenue totals jump dramatically—94%—in just nine months over the same period of the previous year. 
Every year, the company launches a special, limited-time-only product to celebrate their annual olive harvest in California. In December 2021, SmartBug helped launch the Harvest 2021 Olio Nuovo— or “new oil”. The emails built by the SmartBug team for this product launch generated a 70% increase over the previous product launch. 
SmartBug helped COR rebrand its email communication in March 2022 and refreshed its product labels and website. This involved updating all email and SMS copy, design, and branding. The result was an increase in engagement as evidenced through email flow open rates and SMS flow click rates. Specifically:

53.03% increase in deliverability (total recipients) plus
145% increase in campaign open rates that led to:
62.65% increase in Klaviyo-attributed revenue (total business revenue attributed to email + SMS)
130% increase in placed order rate 

Additionally, SmartBug’s work inspired designs in other areas of the company to create greater synergy in their ecosystem. 
“SmartBug thought about the customer journey throughout and created a flow and consistency in design that represents our brand so well,” Fox confirmed. “It’s very seamless to work with the team at SmartBug because they’re an extension of our team. It is not an overstatement to say half our site’s revenue is generated through SmartBug.”

        How much does HubSpot cost?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      HubSpot’s customer platform contains a complete set of marketing, sales, occupancy management, and customer support tools. Pricing depends on what functions you need and how many users you have. 

HubSpot is competitively priced compared to other CRMs. We are happy to provide a recommendation on what functionality would benefit your team the most, but feel free to explore pricing on your own if you’d find that helpful.
    
    
    
      
        What is the difference between HubSpot onboarding with SmartBug vs. with HubSpot’s professional services team?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      The key difference between the two onboarding styles is that SmartBug’s offers full onboarding, training, and configuration based on the package you choose. HubSpot also has multiple offerings, but many are DIY with general guidance for you to configure on your own.
    
    
    
      
        What makes SmartBug the best choice for onboarding?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      We have more than 300 team members, more than 10 of whom are certified HubSpot trainers. Our team holds 1,200+ professional certifications, including 100 percent of HubSpot’s advanced accreditations.
    
    
    
      
        My team is new to HubSpot. Do you offer training?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Yes! As part of the initial onboarding and setup, our team of HubSpot experts will also conduct a training session to familiarize your team with HubSpot. Once your integration is complete, we offer ongoing support as a chance to answer questions, troubleshoot any concerns, and identify other opportunities for optimization.
    
    
    
      
        How long does a typical onboarding take?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      The typical onboarding process usually takes between 4 to 12 weeks. During this period, our dedicated team works closely with you to ensure a smooth transition, provide the necessary training, and address any questions or concerns you may have. Our goal is to tailor the onboarding experience to your unique requirements while ensuring that you are fully equipped to make the most of our offerings.
    
    
    
      
        What if I want more help than what is listed in a package?
        
          
            
            
          
        
      
      Not a problem! We can tailor our work to exactly what you need. If you need a little more, we can add some time to offer additional support in specific areas. Or we can always put together a totally custom plan specific to your needs and goals.

            SmartBug® Jump-Starts Inbound and Sales for a Global IT Solutions Company
Axians contacted SmartBug® as a brand-new HubSpot client. It had solid web traffic streaming in, but the Axians team needed a partner to help implement HubSpot, and execute an inbound marketing strategy to qualify and convert leads. At the same time, Axians’ sales team was intrigued by the sales automation potential in HubSpot’s Sales Hub, but needed the proper guidance to utilize everything the platform has to offer.

            Lavi Industries
            
            Queuing Management Expert Advances Sales Enablement Strategy with HubSpot
Lavi Industries had purchased HubSpot but wasn’t using it enough to justify the investment. The company was impressed with the customer relationship management (CRM) platform but simply didn’t have the bandwidth to realize its full potential. Lavi Industries also recently purchased Sales Pro and needed help installing the solution.

            SmartBug Media® Helped a Startup Investment Firm with a Pressing Deadline Implement and Learn HubSpot
Emles chose HubSpot because it liked how the platform aligned distribution initiatives. As the company was busy preparing and establishing itself in anticipation of its business launch, Emles knew it needed help. It didn’t have the bandwidth or HubSpot expertise to independently establish the solution’s CRM—an important component of Emles’ technology stack and a better alternative than managing customer relationships via spreadsheets.

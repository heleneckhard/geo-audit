						I loved our account team and Gabby was absolutely amazing. Directive helped us drive significant traffic growth over the last four years and has been a grade-A partner. Our decision to leave was primarily based on budget considerations (we had to reduce our agency budget) and, secondarily to get a fresh set of eyes on our strategy and tactics after a long engagement with Directive. You'll hear from me again and I highly recommend Directive to anyone who asks!

						I loved our account team and Gabby was absolutely amazing. Directive helped us drive significant traffic growth over the last four years and has been a grade-A partner. Our decision to leave was primarily based on budget considerations (we had to reduce our agency budget) and, secondarily to get a fresh set of eyes on our strategy and tactics after a long engagement with Directive. You'll hear from me again and I highly recommend Directive to anyone who asks!

    Go-to-market Strategy


				
				
				
				
					
	


Capture engineers, procurement teams, and B2B buyers with performance marketing tailored to long sales cycles, technical products, and channel-driven deals.



 Paid Search:  Target high-intent keywords tied to equipment specs, part numbers, compliance standards, and industrial solution searches.  
 Paid Social:  Engage operations leaders, plant managers, and engineering influencers with content that supports technical evaluation and vendor selection.
  
 Account Based Marketing:  Influence buying committees at OEMs, distributors, and enterprise manufacturers through account-specific outreach.
  
 Programmatic:  Reach industrial audiences by segment and geography through targeted placements across manufacturing publications and forums.
  
 Retargeting:  Re-engage site visitors exploring product catalogs, requesting CAD files, or comparing solution specs across your competitors.
  
 Performance Reporting:  Track campaign performance by vertical, buying stage, and sales region with visibility across rep-driven, distributor-led, and direct sales motions.
 







Rank for high-intent industrial terms and drive RFQs, spec downloads, and plant-level buyers.




 On-Page SEO: Optimize product pages, specification sheets, and application notes to rank for long-tail keywords like “ISO-certified metal stamping,” “FDA-compliant industrial adhesives,” or “Class 100 cleanroom packaging solutions.”
  
 Content Marketing: Develop mid-to-bottom funnel content that supports technical evaluations, such as “how-to” guides on ERP integrations for discrete manufacturers or comparison articles on SCADA vs DCS systems for process industries.
  
 CRO: Run A/B tests on spec sheet download CTAs, CAD file gates, and product request forms to boost conversion from plant managers, procurement leads, and engineers evaluating fit.
  
 Technical SEO:  Ensure schema markup, crawl depth, and indexation are optimized for large product catalogs, supplier databases, and distributor portals — reducing friction for search bots and speeding up time-to-rank.
  
 Content Production:  Create video walk-throughs of factory workflows, process animations, and 3D model explainer assets to reduce sales cycles and support engineering champions in communicating your value internally.
/li>  






Turn spec-seekers, CAD file browsers, and product researchers into high-intent leads with conversion strategies designed for technical B2B buyers and complex distributor-driven sales cycles.



 CRO:  Streamline quoting flows, spec sheet downloads, and configurator interactions to reduce drop-off from engineers and procurement leads mid-evaluation.
  
 Performance Analytics: Track micro-conversions like CAD file downloads, “Request a Quote” initiations, or BOM exports to pinpoint friction and attribute revenue back to each asset.
  
 Image Ads: Use industrial product imagery and environment-specific visuals (e.g., assembly lines, cleanrooms, fabrication shops) to build trust and trigger contextual recall at decision-making moments.
  
 Split Testing: Run iterative tests on CTAs like “Request Technical Data” vs “Download Product Specs” to learn what moves different personas (maintenance engineers vs sourcing managers) through the funnel.
  
 Landing Pages: Develop persona-specific pages — e.g., “Solutions for OEM Procurement Teams” or “Automation Components for Plant Engineers” — that reduce cognitive load and improve time-to-value clarity.
  
 Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Pair motion-based explainer clips (machine operation demos, packaging line time-lapses) with static spec-driven visuals to support both emotional and technical evaluation paths across LinkedIn and programmatic placements.

 






Operationalize every marketing touchpoint with RevOps strategies built for long-cycle, engineer-influenced deals and distributor-split sales motions.


 MAP Audit & Optimization: Refine your marketing automation platform (MAP) to eliminate routing delays for quote requests, spec sheet downloads, and trade show follow-ups — ensuring no lead from an OEM or MRO partner gets lost in the pipeline.
  
 Lifecycle Visualization: Map the buyer journey from CAD file downloads to spec consultation to PO approval, visualizing every interaction across technical stakeholders, procurement teams, and rep-driven deal flows.
  
 Offline Conversion Tracking & Reporting: Attribute revenue from trade shows, distributor referrals, and inbound RFQs by syncing CRM data with source campaigns — even when deals close offline or through rep networks.
  
 Lead Scoring & Lead Routing:  Prioritize engineering managers evaluating system compatibility or operations directors searching for uptime guarantees — and route them to the right AE, channel partner, or regional rep automatically.
  
Integrations & ABM: Connect ERP, CRM, and MAP systems to orchestrate ABM plays for national accounts, regional plants, and strategic OEMs — ensuring campaign visibility from first touch to final PO.
  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns: < Deploy segmented email nurtures by buyer type (plant manager, systems integrator, sourcing director) and sales stage — from solution fit education to post-demo justification enablement.







Accelerate market penetration with GTM strategies designed for niche industrial buyers, complex sales motions, and distributor-influenced revenue paths.



 Competitor Assessments:  See how OEMs, component suppliers, and contract manufacturers position themselves, from spec callouts to trade ad messaging, so you can claim white space in technical and channel strategy.
  
1st-Party Data Collection: Capture insights from RFQ forms, sample kit requests, CAD file downloads, and trade show scans to inform segmentation, build remarketing audiences, and fuel sales enablement initiatives.
  
 TAM Identification: Quantify total addressable accounts by SIC/NAICS, facility type, or system compatibility — from Tier 1 suppliers in automotive to contract packagers in CPG — to ensure campaigns are only targeting winnable buyers.
  
 Financial Modeling: Project pipeline impact, CAC payback, and channel ROI across direct, distributor-led, and rep-driven models — giving finance, RevOps, and leadership the clarity they need to greenlight budget.
  
 Persona Development: Build segment-specific buyer archetypes (e.g., Controls Engineer at a tier-2 automotive supplier vs Director of Procurement at a regional plastics manufacturer) with messaging frameworks tailored to evaluation criteria, risk tolerance, and buying triggers.
  
 Deliverable Strategies: Operationalize your GTM plan through campaign blueprints, offer testing sequences, and asset roadmaps that align to every persona, buying stage, and sales motion — from first-touch education to final mile enablement.

 Paid Social: Activate decision-makers in utilities, energy tech, and public works through LinkedIn, Meta, and YouTube.  
 Account Based Marketing: Influence multi-stakeholder utility deals and large commercial energy buyers with precision outreach.

 Retargeting: Re-engage site visitors comparing rates, exploring incentives, or vetting clean energy solutions.  
 Performance Reporting: Track campaign performance across service areas, segments, and buying cycles with utility-grade visibility. 







Rank for industry-specific search terms and position your company as a leader in sustainability, efficiency, and energy management.


  On-Page SEO: Optimize solution pages for keywords like “demand response software” or “utility-scale solar analytics” to attract engineers, energy buyers, and operations leaders.
  
  Content Marketing: Produce data-driven guides, regulatory breakdowns, and comparison content that helps prospects evaluate technologies like AMI systems or DER platforms.

  
  CRO:  Test CTA placement on quote forms, ROI calculators, and resource downloads to increase conversion from municipal buyers, facility managers, and consultants.

  
  Technical SEO:  Ensure clean site structure, schema markup, and fast load times across asset-heavy sites or platform pages to support enterprise SEO and mobile access in the field.

  
  Content Production: Create content assets like emissions dashboards, case studies, and executive explainers that speak to both sustainability officers and technical evaluators.

  






Convert energy buyers, procurement teams, and sustainability officers with optimized digital experiences built for complex solutions and long evaluation cycles.



 CRO: Simplify flows for audit bookings, rebate lookups, and energy consultations to reduce drop-off and capture qualified commercial interest.

  
 Performance Analytics: Track engagement by industry segment, from manufacturers seeking peak load optimization to municipalities exploring renewables.

  
 Image Ads: Use visuals that show energy dashboards, smart meters, or on-site solar installs to align with the buyer’s context and decision-making environment.

  
 Split Testing: Test headlines, CTAs, and form logic across verticals like utilities vs energy-as-a-service to uncover what drives conversions in each segment.

  
 Landing Pages: Create sector-specific pages like “Energy Efficiency for School Districts” or “Commercial Solar for Manufacturing Facilities” with focused CTAs and proof points.

  
 Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Pair motion-based graphics (e.g. carbon offset animations, energy flow visualizations) with static images that communicate savings, compliance, or operational ROI.

 






Power complex, multi-stakeholder sales cycles with automation and attribution systems built for utilities, energy consultants, and infrastructure providers.



 MAP Audit & Optimization: Refine lead flows for rebate submissions, energy audits, and RFP follow-ups to ensure automation supports compliance and regional targeting.

  
 Lifecycle Visualization: Visualize the full journey from early engagement with ESG content to procurement milestones and contract approvals in both public and private sectors.

  
 Offline Conversion Tracking & Reporting: Track revenue from field sales, channel partners, and in-person consultations by syncing offline activity with CRM and campaign data.

  
 Lead Scoring & Lead Routing: Score commercial facility leads, sustainability officers, or municipal contacts based on energy goals and route them to the right rep or partner team.

  
 Integrations & ABM: Connect MAP, CRM, and enrichment platforms to enable account-specific targeting for utilities, ESCOs, and large-scale commercial buyers.

  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns: Create segmented nurtures by vertical and stage, such as energy audits for manufacturers or net-zero planning for school districts.








Expand market share with strategies built for regulated industries, long procurement cycles, and energy buyers focused on reliability, cost savings, and sustainability goals.




 Competitor Assessments: Analyze how competing energy platforms, utilities, and consultants position their offerings across clean tech, grid optimization, and carbon reduction to find whitespace you can own.

  
 1st-Party Data Collection: Use quote requests, calculator submissions, and audit inquiries to capture behavioral signals and refine messaging by project size, region, or energy goal.

  
 TAM Identification: Build a segmented TAM based on facility type, energy consumption, regulatory region, or carbon reduction targets to focus on the most winnable accounts.

  
 Financial Modeling: Project CAC, LTV, and ROI by vertical or deal size to align growth targets with realistic acquisition cost and revenue timelines.

  
 Persona Development: Create detailed profiles for sustainability directors, energy procurement leads, facilities managers, and city planners with messaging aligned to their goals and objections.

 Paid Search: Capture high-intent searches like “enterprise IT consulting,” “outsourced HR services,” or “B2B legal advisory” with copy designed to match decision-stage queries.

  
 Paid Social: Reach executives, operations leads, and procurement teams on LinkedIn with ads focused on outcomes, expertise, and client results.
  
 Account Based Marketing: Target verified accounts with campaigns tailored to vertical, role, and pain point—such as CFOs exploring financial audits or COOs vetting outsourcing partners.

  
 Programmatic: Serve ads across niche industry publications, professional networks, and content hubs to increase brand visibility with your ideal clients.

  
 Retargeting: Re-engage visitors who view service pages, pricing, or case studies with messaging that reinforces expertise and prompts next steps.

  
 Performance Reporting: Track CPL, lead quality, and pipeline movement by campaign, channel, and client type to see exactly what’s driving growth.

 







Attract qualified leads and establish authority with SEO and content strategies built for credibility-driven, high-trust service industries.



 On-Page SEO: Optimize service pages for keywords like “IT consulting for law firms” or “HR compliance services for SMBs” to capture bottom-funnel traffic aligned to buyer intent.

  
 Content Marketing: Publish actionable guides, comparison content, and strategic thought pieces that help clients vet vendors and understand service outcomes.

  
 CRO: Test service inquiry flows, quote forms, and gated asset CTAs to increase conversion from executive-level visitors and decision-making teams.

  
 Technical SEO: Improve site performance, mobile responsiveness, and internal linking across thought leadership hubs and service libraries to boost authority and rankings.

  
 Content Production: Create expert-driven articles, case studies, and webinar assets that showcase industry experience and address key decision points in the sales cycle.

  






Convert more qualified leads with user experiences and messaging designed for high-trust, expertise-driven service engagements.




 CRO: Refine contact forms, consultation flows, and service pages to reduce friction and build trust with decision-makers evaluating providers.

  
 Performance Analytics: Monitor visitor behavior across pages like pricing, team bios, and case studies to identify drop-off points and optimize conversion paths.

  
 Image Ads: Use professional imagery, team visuals, and client success visuals to humanize your brand and reinforce credibility.

  
 Split Testing: Test different CTAs, value props, and form placements to improve conversion from executive buyers and procurement leads.

  
 Landing Pages: Create segmented landing pages by service type or vertical, such as “Compliance Consulting for SaaS” or “M&A Advisory for Healthcare.”

  
 Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Pair motion-based explainers with static visuals that highlight client outcomes, credentials, or industry-specific expertise.

 






Implement automation and analytics to streamline service inquiries and maximize operational efficiency.


MAP Audit & Optimization: Optimize marketing automation for form follow-ups, consultation scheduling, and nurture sequences to keep leads moving through the funnel.

  
Lifecycle Visualization: Track every stage of the buyer journey, from initial engagement to signed agreement, across sales, marketing, and client service teams.

  
Offline Conversion Tracking & Reporting: Sync offline activities like referral calls, client pitches, or in-person consultations with your CRM to enable full-funnel attribution.

  
Lead Scoring & Lead Routing: Score leads by industry, company size, and service interest, then route them to the appropriate partner, consultant, or account manager.

  
Integrations & ABM: Connect your CRM, MAP, and targeting tools to run account-based campaigns for high-value clients across legal, IT, or financial services.

  
Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns: Create nurture sequences tailored to different services and buyer roles, such as CFOs evaluating audit services or COOs exploring outsourcing.








Scale your service-based business with targeted strategies designed to increase visibility and client acquisition.


 Competitor Assessments: Analyze how similar firms position their services, price their offers, and showcase expertise to identify gaps you can own.

  
 1st-Party Data Collection: Use lead forms, proposal requests, and content interactions to capture behavioral insights and sharpen segmentation.

  
 TAM Identification: Define your total addressable market by company size, vertical, and service need to focus your efforts on winnable accounts.

  
 Financial Modeling: Project CAC, LTV, and payback periods by service line or buyer type to guide budget and growth planning.

  
 Persona Development: Build personas like the CFO evaluating risk advisory or the CTO researching managed IT services, complete with goals and objections.

  
 Deliverable Strategies: Translate your GTM plan into campaigns, content assets, and sales enablement tools that align with how clients actually make buying decisions.

    Go-to-market Strategy


				
				
				
				
					
	


Eliminate wasted ad spend with performance-driven campaigns that capture high-intent buyers across complex funnels, long sales cycles, and technical product categories.




 Paid Search: Target high-intent queries like “best cloud DR platform,” “DevSecOps tools for enterprise,” or “SaaS pricing automation software” to intercept buyers deep in the evaluation stage — and segment copy by feature, function, or compliance use case.
  
 Paid Social: Engage IT leaders, security engineers, and RevOps stakeholders on LinkedIn with value-prop-first creative — like benchmark data, integration maps, or competitive tear-downs that support internal stakeholder buy-in and sales acceleration.  
 Account Based Marketing: Run layered plays against verified TAM accounts — from Series C SaaS to Fortune 100 IT teams — using custom messaging for multiple personas across engineering, finance, and procurement to influence entire buying committees.
  
 Programmatic: Reach technical decision-makers across niche communities like Stack Overflow, InfoSec forums, or AI research publications with precision-targeted placements tied to product category, job function, and industry signals.
  
 Retargeting: Re-engage users who’ve evaluated your demo, viewed pricing, or downloaded product docs with hyper-personalized ads — such as “Still comparing ML platforms?” or “Need SOC 2 before Q4?” — designed to close consideration gaps.
  
 Performance Reporting: Get granular visibility into CPL, demo-to-close velocity, and pipeline by persona, vertical, and source — whether you’re selling to CTOs in FinTech or Heads of Engineering at late-stage SaaS firms.
 







Capture demand and drive organic growth with data-driven SEO strategies tailored to the fast-evolving tech landscape where speed, scalability, and SERP authority separate category leaders from everyone else.



 On-Page SEO: Optimize product and solution pages for high-intent, feature-specific keywords like “SOC 2 compliance automation,” “Kubernetes monitoring tools,” or “AI-powered sales forecasting” — structured to match the search logic of your ICP.
  
 Content Marketing: Create value-dense, mid-funnel content like integration breakdowns, buyer checklists, and platform comparison guides that support technical validation and shorten time-to-demo across multi-stakeholder sales motions.
  
 CRO: Test and refine CTAs across demo pages, pricing breakdowns, and resource hubs to improve lead velocity from RevOps leaders, security engineers, and product evaluators — without sacrificing UX for speed.
  
 Technical SEO: Improve crawlability, site speed, and indexation logic for dynamic product catalogs and CMS-heavy resource centers — while structuring schema and internal linking around high-value features, integrations, and use cases.
  
 Content Production: Produce founder-led POV articles, engineering-authored explainer posts, and video content that drives both affinity and SEO authority — built to outperform templated AI blogs and low-quality content mills flooding your category.
  






Optimize the full user journey to turn qualified traffic into high-intent demo requests, product sign-ups, and retained revenue.


 CRO: Reduce drop-off on demo forms, pricing pages, and feature explainer flows by testing CTA language, objection-handling copy, and interactive UX elements tuned to developer, ops, or finance personas.
  
 Performance Analytics: Track session-to-signup rates, funnel abandonment points, and trial-to-paid conversions with segmented reporting by persona, industry, and campaign source — so you can diagnose and optimize in real-time.
  
 Image Ads: Use platform-native visuals (e.g. UI snippets, charts, dashboards) over generic SaaS stock imagery to drive recognition and relevance — especially for complex tools like observability platforms or billing orchestration layers.
  
 Split Testing: A/B test everything from signup modals to post-click experiences — like “Start free trial” vs “Deploy your sandbox” — to identify copy and layout combinations that convert technical vs non-technical buyers.
  
 Landing Pages: Build modular landing pages for each use case (e.g. “SOC 2 readiness for SaaS,” “DevOps pipelines for fintech”) with social proof, ROI narratives, and real product UI to match the intent of high-converting search and social traffic.
  
 Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Design ad creative that blends motion-based explainers (e.g. workflow GIFs, integration animations) with static headline-forward visuals — enabling rapid experimentation and channel-specific learning across LinkedIn, YouTube, and programmatic.
 






Align marketing and sales with advanced automation, analytics, and CRM integrations that unlock pipeline efficiency, accelerate deal velocity, and support scale across PLG and sales-led motions.



 MAP Audit & Optimization: Fix gaps in lead flow, attribution, and nurture logic across platforms like HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot — ensuring MQLs, PQLs, and sales-ready leads route cleanly and convert consistently.
  
 Lifecycle Visualization:  Map the full buyer journey from ad click to opportunity creation — tracking behaviors like pricing visits, doc hub views, and in-app triggers to align funnel stages with revenue outcomes.
  
 Offline Conversion Tracking & Reporting: Attribute revenue from offline sources like field events, outbound sequences, or sales-assisted trials by syncing CRM and campaign data — so nothing breaks between first touch and closed-won.
  
 Lead Scoring & Lead Routing:  Deploy persona-based scoring models to prioritize RevOps leads exploring integrations, security engineers comparing compliance stacks, or CFOs scanning for cost-efficiency — and route them dynamically to SDRs or AEs based on GTM motion.
  
 Integrations & ABM:  Connect Clearbit, 6sense, and CRM systems to power account-level engagement — enabling 1:1 campaigns for ICP-fit accounts in high-value verticals like FinTech, HealthTech, or AI/ML.
  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns:  Launch lifecycle-specific nurtures tied to funnel status and persona — from activation sequences for self-serve users to re-engagement plays for sales-influenced ops buyers stuck in technical evaluation.







Accelerate market penetration with proven strategies that position your tech brand to win in competitive categories.


 Competitor Assessments: Deconstruct messaging, feature positioning, and ad targeting strategies of direct competitors — from early-stage disruptors to incumbents — so you can carve out whitespace and build a differentiated narrative that converts.
  
 1st-Party Data Collection: Leverage demo form data, product usage signals, trial behavior, and content engagement to refine ICPs, shape campaign sequencing, and reduce guesswork in outbound or ABM programs.
  
 TAM Identification: Build a regression-validated TAM based on firmographics, tech stack, and intent signals — whether you’re targeting cloud-native mid-market SaaS firms or enterprise IT buyers modernizing legacy infrastructure.
  
 Financial Modeling: Forecast CAC, LTV, payback periods, and pipeline velocity by GTM motion (PLG vs sales-led) and vertical — giving CFOs and revenue leaders the data they need to scale confidently.
  
 Persona Development: Develop decision-maker and influencer personas based on real buying triggers — like the Head of DevOps seeking faster deployment, or the CFO looking to consolidate tools post-Series C.
  
 Deliverable Strategies: Translate GTM goals into executable roadmaps — including full-funnel campaign briefs, offer testing cadences, launch playbooks, and enablement assets that align to sales cycles, vertical nuances, and revenue milestones.

 Performance Reporting: Get granular visibility into CPL, demo-to-close velocity, and pipeline by persona, vertical, and source — whether you’re selling to CTOs in FinTech or Heads of Engineering at late-stage SaaS firms.
 







Capture demand and drive organic growth with data-driven SEO strategies tailored to the fast-evolving tech landscape where speed, scalability, and SERP authority separate category leaders from everyone else.



 On-Page SEO: Optimize product and solution pages for high-intent, feature-specific keywords like “SOC 2 compliance automation,” “Kubernetes monitoring tools,” or “AI-powered sales forecasting” — structured to match the search logic of your ICP.
  
 Content Marketing: Create value-dense, mid-funnel content like integration breakdowns, buyer checklists, and platform comparison guides that support technical validation and shorten time-to-demo across multi-stakeholder sales motions.
  
 CRO: Test and refine CTAs across demo pages, pricing breakdowns, and resource hubs to improve lead velocity from RevOps leaders, security engineers, and product evaluators — without sacrificing UX for speed.
  
 Technical SEO: Improve crawlability, site speed, and indexation logic for dynamic product catalogs and CMS-heavy resource centers — while structuring schema and internal linking around high-value features, integrations, and use cases.
  
 Content Production: Produce founder-led POV articles, engineering-authored explainer posts, and video content that drives both affinity and SEO authority — built to outperform templated AI blogs and low-quality content mills flooding your category.
  






Optimize the full user journey to turn qualified traffic into high-intent demo requests, product sign-ups, and retained revenue.


 CRO: Reduce drop-off on demo forms, pricing pages, and feature explainer flows by testing CTA language, objection-handling copy, and interactive UX elements tuned to developer, ops, or finance personas.
  
 Performance Analytics: Track session-to-signup rates, funnel abandonment points, and trial-to-paid conversions with segmented reporting by persona, industry, and campaign source — so you can diagnose and optimize in real-time.
  
 Image Ads: Use platform-native visuals (e.g. UI snippets, charts, dashboards) over generic SaaS stock imagery to drive recognition and relevance — especially for complex tools like observability platforms or billing orchestration layers.
  
 Split Testing: A/B test everything from signup modals to post-click experiences — like “Start free trial” vs “Deploy your sandbox” — to identify copy and layout combinations that convert technical vs non-technical buyers.
  
 Landing Pages: Build modular landing pages for each use case (e.g. “SOC 2 readiness for SaaS,” “DevOps pipelines for fintech”) with social proof, ROI narratives, and real product UI to match the intent of high-converting search and social traffic.
  
 Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Design ad creative that blends motion-based explainers (e.g. workflow GIFs, integration animations) with static headline-forward visuals — enabling rapid experimentation and channel-specific learning across LinkedIn, YouTube, and programmatic.
 






Align marketing and sales with advanced automation, analytics, and CRM integrations that unlock pipeline efficiency, accelerate deal velocity, and support scale across PLG and sales-led motions.



 MAP Audit & Optimization: Fix gaps in lead flow, attribution, and nurture logic across platforms like HubSpot, Marketo, or Pardot — ensuring MQLs, PQLs, and sales-ready leads route cleanly and convert consistently.
  
 Lifecycle Visualization:  Map the full buyer journey from ad click to opportunity creation — tracking behaviors like pricing visits, doc hub views, and in-app triggers to align funnel stages with revenue outcomes.
  
 Offline Conversion Tracking & Reporting: Attribute revenue from offline sources like field events, outbound sequences, or sales-assisted trials by syncing CRM and campaign data — so nothing breaks between first touch and closed-won.
  
 Lead Scoring & Lead Routing:  Deploy persona-based scoring models to prioritize RevOps leads exploring integrations, security engineers comparing compliance stacks, or CFOs scanning for cost-efficiency — and route them dynamically to SDRs or AEs based on GTM motion.
  
 Integrations & ABM:  Connect Clearbit, 6sense, and CRM systems to power account-level engagement — enabling 1:1 campaigns for ICP-fit accounts in high-value verticals like FinTech, HealthTech, or AI/ML.
  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns:  Launch lifecycle-specific nurtures tied to funnel status and persona — from activation sequences for self-serve users to re-engagement plays for sales-influenced ops buyers stuck in technical evaluation.







Accelerate market penetration with proven strategies that position your tech brand to win in competitive categories.


 Competitor Assessments: Deconstruct messaging, feature positioning, and ad targeting strategies of direct competitors — from early-stage disruptors to incumbents — so you can carve out whitespace and build a differentiated narrative that converts.
  
 1st-Party Data Collection: Leverage demo form data, product usage signals, trial behavior, and content engagement to refine ICPs, shape campaign sequencing, and reduce guesswork in outbound or ABM programs.
  
 TAM Identification: Build a regression-validated TAM based on firmographics, tech stack, and intent signals — whether you’re targeting cloud-native mid-market SaaS firms or enterprise IT buyers modernizing legacy infrastructure.
  
 Financial Modeling: Forecast CAC, LTV, payback periods, and pipeline velocity by GTM motion (PLG vs sales-led) and vertical — giving CFOs and revenue leaders the data they need to scale confidently.
  
 Persona Development: Develop decision-maker and influencer personas based on real buying triggers — like the Head of DevOps seeking faster deployment, or the CFO looking to consolidate tools post-Series C.
  
 Deliverable Strategies: Translate GTM goals into executable roadmaps — including full-funnel campaign briefs, offer testing cadences, launch playbooks, and enablement assets that align to sales cycles, vertical nuances, and revenue milestones.

					Directive didn’t start with a business plan. It started with a career-ending injury.
In 2013, at 21, I was chasing a pro soccer career. I had a master’s degree in hand and a clear path ahead, until a serious injury took me off the field for good.
I had no roadmap, no job, and no backup plan.
So, I turned to the one thing that felt like a game I could still win: digital marketing.
I didn’t join an agency. I built one—from a cramped apartment in Azusa, California. No outside funding. No network. Living on $12 a day. My first clients? A shawarma shop, a hookah lounge, and a local plumber.
Execution Over Theory Execution Over Theory
I wasn’t optimizing for virality or followers. I was optimizing for survival—and real client outcomes.
That meant learning by doing. I teamed up with my best friend, Tanner Shaffer, and we immersed ourselves in SEO, PPC, and demand gen. No fluff. No gurus. Just campaigns that had to convert or we didn’t eat.
Every campaign was a test. Every win was a signal. We built our expertise through repetition, not theory. From SEO and PPC to content and CRO, we went deep on the tactics that moved revenue, not just rankings.

Early days at Directive: from roommates to revenue growth.
Growth Was Earned Growth Was Earned
We reinvested every dollar. Every client win became a case study. We didn’t chase shiny metrics—we chased revenue. Over time, that obsession with performance became our competitive edge.
We built out content marketing. Paid social. Landing page design. Every new service was a direct response to what our clients actually needed to grow—not what agencies wanted to sell.
Over time, that mindset became a methodology.
Every service was grounded in the same principles:

Drive qualified pipeline
Reduce acquisition cost
Align marketing to revenue

The growth followed. Clients stayed. Word spread.
From Azusa to the World From Azusa to the World
Today, Directive is a 150+ person agency operating across North America, LATAM, and Europe. From Orange County to Austin, New York City to Mexico City, London to Toronto—we support B2B and SaaS brands that are serious about scale.
But our core hasn’t changed. We still prioritize:

Data over assumptions
ROI over vanity metrics
People above everything else

We hire marketers who can think strategically and execute ruthlessly. We don’t separate brand from performance. We see them as compounding forces.
Customer Generation > Lead Generation Customer Generation > Lead Generation
Directive isn’t a traditional agency. We’re a revenue partner.
Our Customer Generation framework replaces outdated MQL playbooks with full-funnel alignment. It’s how we connect strategy to pipeline, and pipeline to profit.
We exist to help companies grow—intentionally, predictably, and measurably. No shortcuts. No spray-and-pray. Just high-impact execution built to close deals, not collect downloads.

We exist to help companies grow—intentionally, predictably, and measurably.

Built for What Comes Next Built for What Comes Next
Directive’s story isn’t one of chance. It’s one of control. Of reinvention. Of doing the hard work, over and over, until the result is undeniable.
We didn’t get here on vision alone. We got here by choosing performance, every time.
And we’re just getting started.

Every campaign was a test. Every win was a signal. We built our expertise through repetition, not theory. From SEO and PPC to content and CRO, we went deep on the tactics that moved revenue, not just rankings.

Early days at Directive: from roommates to revenue growth.
Growth Was Earned Growth Was Earned
We reinvested every dollar. Every client win became a case study. We didn’t chase shiny metrics—we chased revenue. Over time, that obsession with performance became our competitive edge.
We built out content marketing. Paid social. Landing page design. Every new service was a direct response to what our clients actually needed to grow—not what agencies wanted to sell.
Over time, that mindset became a methodology.
Every service was grounded in the same principles:

Drive qualified pipeline
Reduce acquisition cost
Align marketing to revenue

The growth followed. Clients stayed. Word spread.
From Azusa to the World From Azusa to the World
Today, Directive is a 150+ person agency operating across North America, LATAM, and Europe. From Orange County to Austin, New York City to Mexico City, London to Toronto—we support B2B and SaaS brands that are serious about scale.
But our core hasn’t changed. We still prioritize:

Data over assumptions
ROI over vanity metrics
People above everything else

We hire marketers who can think strategically and execute ruthlessly. We don’t separate brand from performance. We see them as compounding forces.
Customer Generation > Lead Generation Customer Generation > Lead Generation
Directive isn’t a traditional agency. We’re a revenue partner.
Our Customer Generation framework replaces outdated MQL playbooks with full-funnel alignment. It’s how we connect strategy to pipeline, and pipeline to profit.
We exist to help companies grow—intentionally, predictably, and measurably. No shortcuts. No spray-and-pray. Just high-impact execution built to close deals, not collect downloads.

We exist to help companies grow—intentionally, predictably, and measurably.

Built for What Comes Next Built for What Comes Next
Directive’s story isn’t one of chance. It’s one of control. Of reinvention. Of doing the hard work, over and over, until the result is undeniable.
We didn’t get here on vision alone. We got here by choosing performance, every time.
And we’re just getting started.

									SEO FAQ								
				
					
				
		
				
				
							
						
				
					 What is revenue operations and why does it matter for growth? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									Revenue operations (RevOps) is the function that aligns sales, marketing, and customer success around shared systems, data, and processes to drive revenue growth. Instead of operating in silos, revenue teams work from a unified go to market strategy that improves operational efficiency, strengthens the customer journey, and creates predictable growth. For many companies, RevOps becomes the foundation for making informed decisions at scale.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does RevOps improve the customer experience? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									RevOps improves the customer experience by creating consistency across every touchpoint in the customer journey. When marketing, sales, and customer success share data and processes, customers receive clearer messaging, smoother handoffs, and faster support. This alignment directly supports retention, expansion, and long-term revenue growth.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does RevOps drive measurable and predictable growth? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									RevOps drives measurable growth by improving visibility into performance, standardizing metrics, and enabling better forecasting. By aligning marketing and sales, optimizing systems, and automating workflows, RevOps helps organizations reduce waste, increase efficiency, and create predictable growth backed by reliable data.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does Directive approach revenue operations differently? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									Directive acts as a critical partner, not just a service provider. Our RevOps consultants combine subject matter expertise in strategy, systems, and growth with hands-on execution. We focus on building scalable revenue operations that support long-term success, not short-term fixes. Every engagement is designed to deliver clarity, alignment, and tangible business value.

						I can not speak highly enough of Directive and what they've done to help with our HubSpot implementation. They are incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and quick to respond if I have any questions. They've made the process of moving into HubSpot easy and we've implemented things faster because of them. They also come to each meeting with new ideas and things to try out that have helped us accomplish a lot. Thank you to the Directive team, especially Ishaan and Kristina!

					Frequently Asked Questions About B2B Lead Generation				
				
		
		
					
				
				
									SEO FAQ								
				
					
				
		
				
				
							
						
				
					 What is revenue operations and why does it matter for growth? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									Revenue operations (RevOps) is the function that aligns sales, marketing, and customer success around shared systems, data, and processes to drive revenue growth. Instead of operating in silos, revenue teams work from a unified go to market strategy that improves operational efficiency, strengthens the customer journey, and creates predictable growth. For many companies, RevOps becomes the foundation for making informed decisions at scale.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does RevOps improve the customer experience? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									RevOps improves the customer experience by creating consistency across every touchpoint in the customer journey. When marketing, sales, and customer success share data and processes, customers receive clearer messaging, smoother handoffs, and faster support. This alignment directly supports retention, expansion, and long-term revenue growth.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does RevOps drive measurable and predictable growth? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									RevOps drives measurable growth by improving visibility into performance, standardizing metrics, and enabling better forecasting. By aligning marketing and sales, optimizing systems, and automating workflows, RevOps helps organizations reduce waste, increase efficiency, and create predictable growth backed by reliable data.								
				
				
					
						
				
					 How does Directive approach revenue operations differently? 
							
			
			
		

						
				
				
				
									Directive acts as a critical partner, not just a service provider. Our RevOps consultants combine subject matter expertise in strategy, systems, and growth with hands-on execution. We focus on building scalable revenue operations that support long-term success, not short-term fixes. Every engagement is designed to deliver clarity, alignment, and tangible business value.

Establish thought leadership in the healthcare space with high-ranking content that engages your audience while meeting compliance standards.



  On-Page SEO: Optimize key pages for terms like “remote patient monitoring platform” or “clinical trial management software” to capture buyers searching with clinical and operational intent.

  
  Content Marketing:  Create guides, FAQs, and comparison pieces that help health system buyers, IT leads, or pharma reps evaluate options across security, outcomes, and integrations.

  
  CRO: Improve demo form UX, patient sign-up flows, and resource CTAs to drive more qualified conversions without sacrificing trust or clarity.

  
  Technical SEO: Ensure fast, secure, and accessible websites with compliant markup and structured data that help search engines understand your services and content categories.

  
  Content Production: Develop expert-led content including provider interviews, HIPAA-focused explainers, and product deep-dives that build credibility and improve organic visibility.

  






Improve patient engagement and streamline appointment bookings with optimized landing pages and user experiences.




CRO: Simplify booking flows, referral forms, and sign-up pages to reduce friction and increase completion rates from both patients and providers.

  
Performance Analytics: Track appointment starts, form drop-offs, and portal sign-ins across service lines, devices, and channels to identify conversion gaps.

  
Image Ads: Use real clinical settings, care team imagery, and patient-centric visuals to build trust and align with healthcare decision-makers.

  
Split Testing: Test CTA variations like “Book an Appointment” vs “Schedule Your Visit” and compare layouts across service lines or audiences.

  
Landing Pages: Create personalized pages for different service areas, such as “Behavioral Health Intake” or “Telehealth for Employers,” with relevant copy and conversion points.

  
Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Combine motion-based explainers and provider testimonials with static creative that highlights key benefits like access, outcomes, or compliance.

 






Integrate your marketing stack for improved efficiency while meeting strict regulatory requirements.

 Lifecycle Visualization: Track the full journey from initial inquiry to treatment, trial enrollment, or software activation across providers, patients, and internal teams.

  Lead Scoring & Lead Routing: Score and route leads based on persona and behavior—whether it’s a clinical admin requesting a demo or a patient scheduling care.

  
 Integrations & ABM: Connect your CRM, marketing automation, and compliance tools to run targeted campaigns for hospital systems, pharma buyers, or provider groups.

  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns: Deploy segmented nurtures that reflect buyer stage and role—from care access workflows for patients to product education for healthcare IT leaders.








Differentiate your brand in the health and pharmaceutical industry with proven strategies that drive adoption and growth.




  Competitor Assessments: Analyze how competitors position digital health tools, pharma platforms, or care solutions to identify gaps in messaging, targeting, and compliance positioning.

  TAM Identification: Define your addressable market by facility type, payer model, or specialty area to focus efforts on the most valuable provider and patient segments.

  
  Financial Modeling: Forecast CAC, LTV, and ROI by vertical or care delivery model to guide GTM investments with clear budget alignment.

  
 Persona Development: Build data-driven personas such as health system IT leaders, clinical ops directors, or patient experience managers with messaging tied to outcomes and risk mitigation.

  
  Deliverable Strategies: Translate your GTM plan into tactical assets, campaign flows, and sales enablement content that meet the needs of buyers while respecting clinical and compliance constraints.

  Performance Reporting: Track conversions, demo requests, and pipeline movement by channel, persona, and account type to identify what’s truly driving ROI.

 







Establish thought leadership in the healthcare space with high-ranking content that engages your audience while meeting compliance standards.



  On-Page SEO: Optimize key pages for terms like “remote patient monitoring platform” or “clinical trial management software” to capture buyers searching with clinical and operational intent.

  
  Content Marketing:  Create guides, FAQs, and comparison pieces that help health system buyers, IT leads, or pharma reps evaluate options across security, outcomes, and integrations.

  
  CRO: Improve demo form UX, patient sign-up flows, and resource CTAs to drive more qualified conversions without sacrificing trust or clarity.

  
  Technical SEO: Ensure fast, secure, and accessible websites with compliant markup and structured data that help search engines understand your services and content categories.

  
  Content Production: Develop expert-led content including provider interviews, HIPAA-focused explainers, and product deep-dives that build credibility and improve organic visibility.

  






Improve patient engagement and streamline appointment bookings with optimized landing pages and user experiences.




CRO: Simplify booking flows, referral forms, and sign-up pages to reduce friction and increase completion rates from both patients and providers.

  
Performance Analytics: Track appointment starts, form drop-offs, and portal sign-ins across service lines, devices, and channels to identify conversion gaps.

  
Image Ads: Use real clinical settings, care team imagery, and patient-centric visuals to build trust and align with healthcare decision-makers.

  
Split Testing: Test CTA variations like “Book an Appointment” vs “Schedule Your Visit” and compare layouts across service lines or audiences.

  
Landing Pages: Create personalized pages for different service areas, such as “Behavioral Health Intake” or “Telehealth for Employers,” with relevant copy and conversion points.

  
Social Motion & Static Ad Sets: Combine motion-based explainers and provider testimonials with static creative that highlights key benefits like access, outcomes, or compliance.

 






Integrate your marketing stack for improved efficiency while meeting strict regulatory requirements.

  Lead Scoring & Lead Routing: Score and route leads based on persona and behavior—whether it’s a clinical admin requesting a demo or a patient scheduling care.

  
 Integrations & ABM: Connect your CRM, marketing automation, and compliance tools to run targeted campaigns for hospital systems, pharma buyers, or provider groups.

  
 Pipeline Nurture & Email Campaigns: Deploy segmented nurtures that reflect buyer stage and role—from care access workflows for patients to product education for healthcare IT leaders.








Differentiate your brand in the health and pharmaceutical industry with proven strategies that drive adoption and growth.




  Competitor Assessments: Analyze how competitors position digital health tools, pharma platforms, or care solutions to identify gaps in messaging, targeting, and compliance positioning.

  TAM Identification: Define your addressable market by facility type, payer model, or specialty area to focus efforts on the most valuable provider and patient segments.

  
  Financial Modeling: Forecast CAC, LTV, and ROI by vertical or care delivery model to guide GTM investments with clear budget alignment.

  
 Persona Development: Build data-driven personas such as health system IT leaders, clinical ops directors, or patient experience managers with messaging tied to outcomes and risk mitigation.

  
  Deliverable Strategies: Translate your GTM plan into tactical assets, campaign flows, and sales enablement content that meet the needs of buyers while respecting clinical and compliance constraints.

					Frequently Asked Questions
				
			
			
									
						
							What is SOCi?
							
						

						
							SOCi is the AI-powered marketing platform built for multi-location brands. We help national and global enterprises manage search, social, reviews, and ads across every location, so local visibility becomes a true growth driver. One platform. Every channel. Total brand control at scale.

						
					
									
						
							How does the SOCi platform work?
							
						

						
							SOCi replaces fragmented tools with a single system that centralizes data, channels, and workflows. Then, Genius AI goes to work—automating content, optimizing listings, responding to reviews, and surfacing insights. The result? Smarter execution, faster decisions, and better local outcomes.

						
					
									
						
							Who is SOCi for?  
							
						

						
							SOCi is built for multi-location enterprises: franchises, chains, or global brands with dozens to thousands of locations. If you need to scale marketing while staying locally relevant, SOCi is your edge.

						
					
									
						
							Can SOCi integrate with our existing systems?
							
						

						
							Yes. SOCi connects with your CRM, review platforms, social networks, compliance tools, and more, so data moves freely, and your team stays in sync.

						
					
									
						
							What makes SOCi different from other platforms?
							
						

						
							Most tools analyze. SOCi acts. It’s the only AI-driven platform that unifies local search, social, reviews, and ads. Then, Genius AI automates the work: creates and posts social content, updates listings, and responds to reviews. You’re more efficient and everywhere your customers are, with less effort.

						
					
									
						
							How does SOCi’s AI actually work?
							
						

						
							SOCi’s Genius AI analyzes data across every channel and location, then executes tasks with precision. Genius Agents write posts, respond to customers, improve local SEO, and more automatically and at scale. The more you use it, the more powerful it becomes.

						
					
									
						
							How secure is the platform? 
							
						

						
							SOCi is enterprise-ready with robust data protection, user access controls, and built-in compliance support through SOCi Shield. Your brand and customer data stay protected, no matter how many locations you operate.

						
					
									
						
							What customer support can we expect?
							
						

						
							SOCi delivers award-winning support from experts who know multi-location marketing. From onboarding to rollout and beyond, we partner with your team to ensure adoption, impact, and long-term success.

						
					
									
						
							What happens during the demo?
							
						

						
							We’ll show you how SOCi simplifies execution, eliminates fragmentation, and turns AI into your unfair advantage. Expect a tailored walkthrough focused on your challenges, your team, and your local growth goals.

				SummaryIn this week's post, learn about TikTok's role as a news source for younger users; more evidence that service area is not a Google ranking factor; and Google's new moderation program for review responses.
TikTok Tops Social Apps as a News Source for Young People
The News: New survey data from the Pew Research Center shows that TikTok has become the most popular social app for news among Americans aged 18–29, overtaking traditional favorites like YouTube and Instagram. 
In 2025, 43% of young adults reported regularly getting their news from TikTok, compared with 41% for YouTube and Facebook and 40% for Instagram. Other platforms such as X and Reddit lagged further behind, with 21% and 18% respectively. Overall, social media remains the dominant source of news for this age group, with 76% saying they often or sometimes turn to social platforms for current events.

Takeaway for Multi-Location Brands: This shift presents both an opportunity and a challenge. TikTok is no longer just a place for trends and entertainment—it’s where consumers discover what’s happening nearby and who’s relevant in their community. Businesses that show up with authentic, timely content—such as event participation, local partnerships, behind-the-scenes updates, or quick reactions to trending topics—are more likely to be seen as part of the local conversation. Visibility on TikTok can directly influence foot traffic, brand trust, and word-of-mouth discovery.
More Confirmation Service Areas are NOT a Local Ranking Factor
The News: Google has never treated service area businesses, or their customers, fairly in search results. For local businesses that provide a service outside of their physical location, their designated service area should be considered a part of that business’s extended location and considered equally “in proximity to” across the area they’ve set. And for customers who are just looking for the best person for the job, proximity isn’t typically an issue if that business is willing to come to them.
But, as the data has shown time-and-again, Google appears to apply the same single-point proximity logic to a service area business as a typical brick-and-mortar store regardless of the service area set. This applies equally to businesses that hide their address.

In a recent LinkedIn post, Claudia Tomina at Reputation Arm provides strong evidence that this is likely by design. In a closer look at the Google API data leak from earlier this year, Claudia found that Service Area data is being used for informational (UI) purposes, rather than for ranking.
“This line from the proto documentation says it all: “WARNING: This proto is not meant to be used directly.” Translation: This is backend storage for display and internal geo-consistency not an input to the ranking model. If service areas were part of ranking logic, they wouldn’t warn engineers not to use them directly.
What This Means for Multi-Location Brands: Authority building is the only way to truly extend GBP visibility outside your immediate proximity. Grow reviews, build your local social presence, get mentions, and post about where you’ve been. Be the best answer across your service area.
Google Now Moderating Review Responses
The News: Earlier this year, when Google let us know they were sunsetting their Q&A feature, they hinted that the future of answers was not just in customer reviews, but in the responses to those reviews. So it’s no surprise that Google has confirmed they are now reviewing those responses to ensure they are in compliance with Google’s content guidelines. Per Google’s help page for managing customer reviews: “If your reply isn’t approved to be posted, you’ll be asked to edit it. Replies usually take up to 10 minutes to review, but sometimes a review can take up to 30 days.”
What This Means for Multi-Location Brands:
Review responses may take longer to post in 2026. To ensure your response is posted quickly and without issue, respond to customer feedback promptly and professionally, and avoid content-policy violations such as keyword stuffing, excessive promotion, spammy language, or irrelevant information in responses.

									Why It Works
				
									 

				
									
													
																	An On-Brand Digital Teammate
								
																	Reputation Agent replies in your brand voice, learns from your feedback, and improves with every review it handles.

															
													
																	Escalates What Matters, Filters the Rest
								
																	Only the reviews that need human attention go to your team, so you can focus on what matters the most.

															
													
																	Always Compliant with SOCi Shield
								
																	With Shield, Genius-generated responses are compliant by default, and it scans user-created replies to block risks.

					Product Q&A
				
			
			
									
						
							What’s the difference between Genius Reviews and Genius Reputation Agent?
							
						

						
							Genius Reviews gives you visibility into feedback. Genius Reputation Agent turns that feedback into action by writing responses, escalating sensitive reviews, and collaborating with other agents to keep your brand protected and visible.


						
					
									
						
							How does Genius Reputation Agent ensure responses are on-brand?
							
						

						
							Every response follows rules you set — tone, keywords, escalation triggers, and more — and runs through Shield, the compliance layer of SOCi’s Genius Platform. The result? Peace of mind and consistent communication at scale.


						
					
									
						
							Can the agent reply to every review, across every platform?
							
						

						
							Yes. Genius Reputation Agent works across major platforms like Google, Yelp, Facebook, and TripAdvisor, crafting timely replies for each — with no extra logins or headcount needed.


						
					
									
						
							What if a review needs a personal or legal touch?
							
						

						
							The agent automatically flags these reviews for manual handling. You define what gets escalated and what can be handled autonomously — the workflow adapts to your business, not the other way around.


						
					
									
						
							How does Reputation Agent support online reputation monitoring?
							
						

						
							It continuously monitors review platforms, identifies shifts in sentiment or volume, and reports insights in real time — enabling smarter decision-making across marketing, customer service, and operations.


						
					
									
						
							How does SOCi Shield work to ensure compliance?
							
						

						
							Shield is built into SOCi’s Genius Platform as a compliance layer that helps multi-location businesses—especially in regulated industries like financial services and healthcare—minimize risk. It applies brand and regulatory standards across social, search, and reputation. Genius content is compliant by default, and Shield monitors user-created content in real time, flagging issues and stopping publication until they’re resolved.

Accordingly, we may use, disclose, and retain your Personal Data if necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation arising under applicable law.
Legitimate Interests. We may collect and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to carry out our legitimate interests (or those of a third party), provided that such interests do not outweigh your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

Please note that we may decline a request where we are unable to verify your identity and confirm the personal information we maintain relates to you.
Authorized Agent 
You may authorize someone to submit a privacy rights request on your behalf (an “authorized agent”). An authorized agent will need to demonstrate that you’ve authorized them to act on your behalf unless you have provided the agent with power of attorney pursuant to applicable probate law. Depending on the evidence provided, we may also contact you to verify your identity with us or request confirmation from you that the agent is authorized to submit the request on your behalf.

If you enable a browser-based opt-out preference signal that complies with the CCPA, such as Global Privacy Control (GPC), upon receipt or detection, we will treat the signal as a valid request to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information linked to that browser and any consumer profile we have associated with that browser. Please note that if you use different browsers or browser profiles, you will have to enable the signal on each one that you use.
An authorized agent may also use the methods described above to submit a request to opt out on your behalf if you provide the agent with signed permission to do so. Please note that we may request from the agent documentation demonstrating that they have your authority to act on your behalf.

							How does SOCi help corporate marketers and franchisees collaborate?
							
						

						
							SOCi gives franchisors full visibility and control while empowering franchisees with easy, on-brand tools. Corporate sets the strategy and guardrails.

Corporate protects the brand, while every location stays active and connected to its community.


						
					
									
						
							What is franchise digital marketing software?
							
						

						
							Franchise digital marketing software helps corporate marketers and franchisees manage local SEO, online reviews, and social media at scale. SOCi centralizes everything in one platform, so corporate teams keep control while franchisees can execute locally.


						
					
									
						
							How does SOCi improve franchise local SEO?
							
						

						
							SOCi’s franchise listings management software keeps every location’s profiles accurate across Google, Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps, and more. Genius AI also surfaces SEO opportunities so each franchise ranks higher in “near me” searches.


						
					
									
						
							Can SOCi help protect my franchise brand reputation?

Overview
SOCi, Inc. is dedicated to ensuring the security of its systems and data through a comprehensive approach that integrates policies, procedures, and technology. Our commitment to security is demonstrated through the implementation of extensive security measures, known as the Common Criteria Controls, aligned with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, and Confidentiality.
Protecting Information Assets
SOCi’s management has established robust information security policies and procedures to safeguard sensitive data. These measures provide a thorough framework for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all company resources and information assets. This commitment not only benefits SOCi but also extends to our employees and clients. We recognize the importance of a secure computing environment and are dedicated to maintaining effective security controls across all aspects of the organization.
Roles & Responsibilities

Continuous Monitoring: All systems and infrastructure undergo constant monitoring.


Vulnerability Assessments: Regular assessments performed by CREST-certified security firms.


Endpoint Protection: Antivirus and malware prevention on all workstations.

Security Monitoring: Our security information and event management system (SIEM) provides best-in-class monitoring.

Data Encryption Methods
SOCi uses robust encryption to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Our encryption strategies include:

Whole Disk Encryption and Partition/File Encryption for sensitive data storage.


Encryption of Disk Drives, Personal Storage Media, and Backups.
Database Encryption to secure stored data.


All transmissions of sensitive data are encrypted using HTTPS or SSH protocols.


SOCi employs accepted encryption algorithms such as AES, 3DES, and TLS 1.2+ to secure data.

Compliance & Security Standards
SOCi, Inc. has established an Information Security and Privacy Management System (ISPMS) to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all entrusted data.

Third-Party Audits: We conduct annual independent assessments of both our technical and organizational controls, including SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001:2013 certifications.


Alignment with Industry Standards: While we are not required to adhere to certain regulations like HIPAA, SOCi’s security practices align with HIPAA’s controls as evidenced in our SOC 2 report. We can also add a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) upon request.

SOCi’s rigorous security protocols are not only aligned with SOC 2 standards but are also adaptable to meet industry-specific requirements as needed.

					Frequently Asked Questions
				
			
			
									
						
							What is restaurant digital marketing?
							
						

						
							Restaurant digital marketing helps brands attract and retain guests through online channels like search, reviews, and social media.


						
					
									
						
							Why is local SEO important for restaurants?
							
						

						
							Most diners search “food near me” before deciding where to eat. Without accurate listings, menus, and hours, your restaurant may not appear when customers are choosing.


						
					
									
						
							How does SOCi support restaurant marketing?
							
						

						
							SOCi centralizes listings, reviews, and social media for every location. Our Genius AI keeps data accurate, replies to reviews, and publishes local content automatically.


						
					
									
						
							Can SOCi help customers find and choose me on delivery apps?
							
						

						
							Yes. SOCi updates your location data on platforms where diners search, like Google Maps and Uber. SOCi also pulls in reviews from apps like Grubhub so you can monitor guest feedback in one place.


						
					
									
						
							Is SOCi built for franchises, chains, and multi-location restaurants?
							
						

						
							Yes. Whether you’re a franchise, a corporate-led chain, or a multi-location restaurant group, SOCi has the tools to fit your model.

					Product Q&A
				
			
			
									
						
							How is Genius Social Agent different from Genius Social? 
							
						

						
							Genius Social provides the strategic planning layer. Genius Social Agent carries that intelligence forward — autonomously creating content, publishing across networks, sourcing media, and managing community interactions. It acts as your brand-trained digital teammate, following your guardrails while handling day-to-day execution.

						
					
									
						
							What is Genius Social?
							
						

						
							Genius Social is an AI-driven social media management platform for multi-location businesses. It analyzes local data to create tailored content calendars and engagement replies, combining real-time insights with a unified brand voice to simplify management and enhance local connections. 


						
					
									
						
							How does Genius Social create content?
							
						

						
							 Social Agent generates posts using data signals from reviews, engagement behavior, website crawls, social best practices, seasonality, and more to generate relevant and engaging content tailored to your audience.


						
					
									
						
							How does Genius Social respond to engagements?
							
						

						
							Genius Social automates engagement responses by generating on-brand replies using AI, ensuring consistent and timely interactions with your audience.


						
					
									
						
							What data does Genius Social use to create content?
							
						

						
							Genius Social is powerful on its own, analyzing past social data and using best practices to create monthly content calendars. It becomes even more powerful with other SOCi products, analyzing customer reviews, past engagement performance, and other relevant sources to create content that resonates with your local audience.


						
					
									
						
							Will posts automatically publish?
							
						

						
							Yes. With Genius Social Agent, posts can automatically publish based on the approval rules you set. You always maintain control over what goes live. If you prefer full oversight, you can require manual review for every post. If you want to streamline workflows, you can allow automatic publishing for certain content types. Your Social Agent follows your brand guardrails and approval directives, ensuring that automation never comes at the expense of compliance or control. In every case, the Agent handles the heavy lifting while you determine the level of oversight that fits your team.


						
					
									
						
							How can corporate and local managers provide content for the AI to post?
							
						

						
							Corporate and local managers can provide content through an intake form, allowing them to highlight promotions, events, team members, and more. The AI uses this information to determine what to post for the month ahead, ensuring relevant and engaging content.


						
					
									
						
							How does Genius Social handle spam detection for engagements?
							
						

						
							Genius Social flags potential spam engagements and does not create responses for them. This helps protect your brand and build trust by ensuring that the most important engagements receive replies.


						
					
									
						
							Is Genius Social suitable for multi-location businesses?
							
						

						
							Genius Social is the best social media management platform for multi-location businesses. It ensures consistent brand messaging across all locations while allowing for localized content tailored to each specific market, making it perfect for businesses with multiple locations.


						
					
									
						
							How does Genius Social work with other SOCi products?
							
						

						
							Genius Social seamlessly integrates with other SOCi products, such as Genius Search and Genius Reviews, to provide a comprehensive marketing solution. This integration ensures consistent data flow and unified management across all digital marketing channels, enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness.


						
					
									
						
							What kind of analytics does Genius Social provide?
							
						

						
							Genius Social offers detailed analytics on reach, engagement, follower growth, and more, allowing you to measure and optimize your social media performance in real-time.


						
					
									
						
							What is SOCi Shield and how does it prevent compliance violations?
							
						

						
							Shield is the built-in compliance layer of SOCi’s Genius Platform. It helps financial services and multi-location businesses minimize risk by enforcing brand and regulatory policies across local search, social, and reputation channels. Teams will never see AI-generated content that’s off-brand or non-compliant. Shield also ensures compliance in real time by flagging issues as users create or edit content and blocking publishing until concerns are resolved.


						
					
									
						
							How does Shield support LinkedIn compliance?
							
						

						
							Shield can require users to manage LinkedIn profile updates directly within SOCi, ensuring all edits and content are reviewed and compliance-approved before going live. It also monitors LinkedIn activity—including comments, messages, and other interactions—to flag potential violations and keep a full archive for retention and auditing.


						
					
									
						
							Will Shield catch social media compliance issues outside SOCi?
							
						

						
							Yes. Shield monitors content posted directly to Google, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, flags violations, and routes them to approvers for review.

				By Kevin Dickard, Senior Manager of Customer Success at SOCi
If I had to summarize the key takeaway from Reimagine in one thought, it’s this: AI isn’t the strategy, it’s the accelerator.
As keynote speaker Gary Vaynerchuk mentioned, “you won’t be replaced by AI, but will be replaced by someone who does.” This idea set the tone for one of the most practical conversations of our event: our main-stage panel, Where the Rubber Meets the Road.
I’m Kevin Dickard, and I had the privilege of moderating a candid discussion that truly belonged to the leaders sitting beside me. Danika Brown from The Goddard School, Sean Stevens from Nothing Bundt Cakes, and Kelli Turner from Anchor Pacifica Management Co. weren’t just talking about AI; they’re already using it to solve real problems, empower teams, and accelerate results in their organizations.
These stories formed a collective playbook: honest about the challenges, clear about what works, and grounded in the real-world ROI they’re seeing today. Here’s what they shared. 
The First Hurdle: Accelerating Buy-In
For all three panelists, the journey didn’t begin with AI itself. It began with a clear business problem they were trying to solve.
Kelli Turner, who oversees marketing for 35 properties as a “department of one,” faced a challenge familiar to lean teams: capacity. She needed a way to scale her output without scaling her headcount. 
“I’m a department of one, so I positioned SOCi as my assistant. When I showed my leadership how it would save a significant amount of my time – allowing me to focus on high-level strategy – it wasn’t a ‘nice to have,’ it was a ‘need to have.'”
Sean Stevens, who leads brand-level social strategy for hundreds of Nothing Bundt Cakes franchise locations, had a different starting point: trust. Franchisees were asking for help, and the question internally became whether the corporate team should absorb the cost.
“For us, the business case was a relationship win. Saying ‘yes’ to our franchisees who were asking for these tools instantly leveled up trust. That qualitative gain was the first, and most important, return on investment, and it has paid off in spades.”
How They Use the Accelerator: What AI Changes in the Daily Workflow
Once buy-in was secured, the real work began: integrating AI into the day-to-day. Each panelist shared how their teams use SOCi’s tools as force multipliers, enhancing the quality and consistency of their execution. 
For Danika Brown, who leads brand reputation for The Goddard School system, the daily workflow revolves around trust. In childcare, a single misstep can undermine years of credibility. Her approach centers on improving response times while preserving oversight where it matters most.
“In childcare, trust is everything. We can’t get a negative review wrong. With Genius Reviews, we built a system to automate and bulk-approve all positive reviews while still elevating sensitive negative reviews for human review. It’s efficiency and oversight.”
For Kelli Turner, the unlock comes from how the tools work together. Managing multifamily communities means eerie insight, whether from reviews, social posts, or scheduling, can fuel another part of the marketing strategy. 
“The platform synergy is the real unlock. I’ll see a positive review in Genius Reviews mentioning how great a manager is, and I’ll immediately use that insight to create a ‘Meet the Team’ post in Genius Social. The data from one tool directly fuels the strategy for another.”
Across the panel, the pattern was clear: AI wasn’t replacing work. It was reorganizing it by turning scattered tasks into connected workflows, creating greater consistency and more opportunities for strategy.
What Changed: Real ROI, Not Theoretical Promise
The conversation naturally shifted from workflows to outcomes, and it was there that the impact became unmistakable. Each panelist had reached a moment where AI stopped being a pilot or an experiment and started producing measurable, repeatable ROI.
For Sean Stevens, that moment came through amplifying local voices. With hundreds of franchise locations, the brand had long believed in the value of local social pages, and now they could quantify it. 
“This isn’t just about talk. We’ve added 700,000 followers to the brand because of these local social pages. We can now show new bakeries that when they use Genius Social during their opening, their engagement and reach is exponentially higher. The proof is right there.”
His insight captured the broader theme: when franchisees are empowered with the right tools, the brand doesn’t just scale content, it scales community. 
Danika Brown brought the ROI conversation back to brand integrity and efficiency. For a system as large and quality-focused as The Goddard School, future-proofing isn’t optional. Her team is using AI to create a more unified, self-service ecosystem across locations.
“The ultimate goal is a centralized, self-service portal. We know that when national and local marketing come together, that’s the secret sauce. Giving franchisees an easy-to-use tool that empowers them, while keeping them on brand, is the key unlock for us.”
Her perspective underscored a key insight: ROI isn’t always a single number. Sometimes it’s the long-term value of consistency, accuracy, and system-wide alignment. 
Across childcare, restaurants, and real estate, the ROI didn’t emerge from novelty. It emerged from solving real problems faster, with less friction, and with more clarity.
The Final Word: How to Start Using the Accelerator
To close the session, the panelists offered a simple, practical roadmap for anyone beginning their AI journey. Their advice came directly from what worked inside their own organizations.
Start with the problem, not the technology.
Each leader emphasized that AI adoption succeeds when it’s anchored to a real business challenge, such as capacity, trust, consistency, or local engagement.
Quantify the ROI of time. 
For lean teams especially, time is the most precise measure of value. Giving people back the space to focus on strategy became one of the strongest business cases across the panel.
Train your AI intentionally.
As Danika noted, rolling out AI agents requires the same discipline as onboarding a new team member. “An agent is only as good as the information you feed it.
Roll out in waves and build internal trust.
Whether supporting franchisees or managing dozens of properties, each panelist started small, proved value quickly, and then expanded.
By the end of the discussion, one theme was unmistakable: AI isn’t a magic want; it’s the accelerator that separates teams that execute with confidence from those that fall behind.

									LOCAL LISTINGS MANAGEMENT
				
									Win Patients Where Their Journey Starts
				
									Patients turn to Google, WebMD, and Healthgrades before they ever walk through your doors. If your practice doesn’t appear in local results, you’re invisible when it matters most.
• 94% of patients use search and reviews to evaluate providers

• “Near me” searches dominate urgent and routine care decisions

• Accurate listings ensure patients never hit a dead end
SOCi centralizes listings across healthcare directories like Healthgrade and Vitals, Google, and Facebook, so every location and provider stays accurate and visible.

									REPUTATION MANAGEMENT
				
									Build Trust at Scale
				
									Reviews are today’s word-of-mouth. For patients and families, they signal trust, credibility, and quality of care.
• 84% trust reviews as much as a friend’s recommendation

• 50% would go out-of-network for a provider with better reviews

• Recency and volume drive credibility more than star ratings alone


SOCi’s AI Reputation Management ensures every patient feels heard, helping providers respond quickly, consistently, and compliantly.

					SOCi Integrations FAQ
				
			
			
									
						
							What platforms does SOCi integrate with? 
							
						

						
							SOCI integrates with 140+ platforms across search, social, reviews, directories, and business systems—including Google Business Profile, Facebook, Yelp, Apple Maps, Salesforce, TikTok, and more.

						
					
									
						
							How do SOCi's integrations work? 
							
						

						
							SOCi connects directly to APIs to sync location data, content, and customer engagement signals in real-time. Updates made in SOCi are automatically pushed to connected platforms across your entire location network.

						
					
									
						
							Do I need to pay extra for integrations?
							
						

						
							The majority of integrations are included as part of the SOCi platform. Some advanced integrations (e.g., with enterprise CRMs or industry-specific tools) may require custom setup or a higher-tier plan. Contact us for details.

						
					
									
						
							Can SOCi integrate with my existing CRM or POS system?
							
						

						
							Yes. SOCi offers integrations with leading CRMs like Salesforce, as well as vertical-specific platforms like Yardi. Don’t see your system listed? Our team can often support custom API-based integrations.

						
					
									
						
							How often is data synced between SOCi and integration platforms?
							
						

						
							Depending on the platform, data syncs in near real-time or at regular intervals throughout the day. SOCi’s AI monitors sync status and alerts your team if any issues arise.

						
					
									
						
							Are SOCi's integrations secure and compliant?
							
						

						
							Yes. SOCi is ISO 27001 certified, undergoes regular SOC 2 Type II audits, and maintains secure, compliant connections with all integration platforms. Our architecture supports enterprise-grade permissions and access control.

						
					
									
						
							What happens if a platform changes its API or requirements?
							
						

						
							SOCI maintains official relationships with top platforms and adapts our integrations to meet updated requirements without disruption to your service. Our team proactively monitors changes to ensure continuous compatibility.

						
					
									
						
							Can I request a new integration?
							
						

						
							Yes. If you don’t see a platform you use, reach out to our team. We’re constantly evaluating new integrations based on customer needs and platform demand.

						
					
									
						
							Do I need IT support to set up integrations?
							
						

						
							SOCI’s integrations are designed for marketing teams to set up and manage with minimal technical support. However, for complex systems or custom connections, our onboarding and support teams are here to help.

						
					
									
						
							Is there a limit to how many integrations I can use at once? 
							
						

						
							No. SOCi is built to scale with your business. You can activate and manage multiple integrations across all your locations from a single dashboard.

									The Multi-Location Marketing Challenge
				
									Managing marketing for dozens or hundreds of locations isn’t simple. You’re up against:

																	✕  Execution gaps that drain visibility, customers, and revenue.

															
													
								
																	SOCi was built to fix this. By unifying search, social, and reputation into a multi-location marketing platform with AI-driven automation and compliance safeguards, SOCi removes the complexity so your team can focus on growth.

				Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol: Powering AI-Driven Shopping
The News: Google announced the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP), an open standard that allows AI agents to interact directly with retailers’ commerce systems, from product discovery to checkout, without custom integrations.

Courtesy Google for Developers
What This Means: UCP accelerates Google’s move toward agentic commerce, where AI assistants do more than recommend products. They complete purchases without sending users to a brand’s website. As more transactions happen directly within Google’s AI experiences, brands should expect continued traffic loss as consumers stay in-platform.
This also raises the stakes for visibility inside AI-generated results. If a brand does not appear in an AI “consideration set,” it effectively loses the sale. 
For brands, success in this environment depends on ensuring product, inventory, and business data is structured, accurate, and AI-ready, so AI agents can confidently surface, recommend, and transact on their behalf.
AI-driven commerce is shrinking the path from discovery to purchase. Brands that fail to optimize for AI visibility risk becoming invisible at the moment of decision.
Apple and Google Partner on AI: Gemini to Power Apple Intelligence
The News: Apple and Google announced a multi-year collaboration in which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud technology. These models will help power upcoming Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri expected later this year.
What This Means: This partnership highlights Google’s growing role as foundational AI infrastructure, even among competitors like Apple. By choosing Gemini, Apple is signaling strong confidence in Google’s AI capabilities.
For users, this enables more personalized and context-aware Apple Intelligence features, while preserving Apple’s privacy standards. For brands, it raises the stakes for AI-driven discovery. As assistants like Siri become more proactive, they will shape recommendations and decisions without relying on traditional search results.
If a brand is not surfaced by these AI systems, it risks being excluded from the consideration phase entirely. Ensuring accurate, structured, and trustworthy business data is essential as AI assistants become primary gateways to information and commerce.
Google Gemini Gains Ground as ChatGPT Loses Share
The News: New data shows ChatGPT is losing market share, while Google Gemini continues to gain adoption, driven by deeper integration across Google Search, Android, and now Apple’s AI ecosystem. The shift highlights changing user behavior as AI becomes embedded directly into products people already use daily.

What This Means: Gemini’s growth highlights the power of distribution. Rather than being a standalone tool, Google is embedding Gemini across Search, Android, and now Apple’s AI ecosystem, making it a default experience for millions of users.
Apple’s decision to build its next-generation AI models on Gemini further compounds Google’s influence. As Gemini powers AI experiences across both Google and Apple platforms, it increasingly shapes how information, recommendations, and decisions are delivered at scale.
For brands, this means AI visibility is consolidating. If a brand is not accurately represented in Google-powered AI experiences, it risks losing relevance across multiple ecosystems at once. Investing in structured, accurate, and trusted data is becoming essential as Gemini’s role in discovery and consideration continues to expand.

				Managing social media at scale has become one of the most operationally complex challenges for multi-location brands. In 2026, visibility on social networks depends less on centralized campaigns and content calendars and more on continuous, localized execution across hundreds or thousands of locations.
As a result, social media management platforms are evolving quickly. Many now include AI-powered assistants, agents, or intelligence layers. But not all AI is designed to solve the same problem. Some platforms help teams work faster. Others help teams work smarter. And a much smaller number are designed to actually do the work.
This guide compares the leading social media management platforms used by multi-location businesses today, with a focus on how each approaches AI, governance, and execution, so teams can determine which operating model best fits their organization.
Why Social Media Management Is Different for Multi-Location Brands
Social media for a single brand or centralized team is fundamentally different from social media for a distributed enterprise.
Multi-location brands must balance:

Brand consistency with local relevance
Corporate oversight with local participation
Compliance requirements with speed and scale

Each location represents a unique audience, local context, and performance profile. Maintaining an active, on-brand presence across every location requires far more than publishing tools – it requires a scalable operating model for execution.
This is where many traditional social media management platforms begin to show their limitations.
How AI Is Changing Social Media Management in 2026
AI is now embedded across nearly every major social media management platform, but its role varies widely depending on the platform’s design philosophy.
In practice, AI in social platforms tends to fall into four categories:

Content assistance – generating or rewriting posts
Intelligence and insights – analyzing performance, trends, or competitors
Governance and compliance – enforcing policies, approvals, and controls
Execution – autonomously planning, publishing, and responding

Most platforms emphasize the first two categories. Some extend into governance and compliance. Only a small subset are built around AI that can execute social work autonomously across every location with minimal human involvement.
For multi-location brands, this distinction is critical. AI that assists teams still depends on human bandwidth. AI designed for execution fundamentally changes how social media scales.
How We Evaluated These Platforms
Rather than ranking platforms by feature checklists, this comparison evaluates how each supports multi-location brands across five dimensions:

AI approach: assistive, intelligence-driven, or autonomous
Execution model: who actually does the work day to day
Governance: brand controls, approvals, and compliance support
Scalability: operational lift as location counts grow
Best-fit customer profile: where each platform performs best

The goal is not to declare a one-size-fits-all winner, but to clarify tradeoffs and highlight which platforms are purpose-built for execution at scale.
Side-by-Side: Leading Social Media Management Platforms for Multi-Location Brands
SOCi: Agentic Social Execution Built for Multi-Location Brands
SOCi approaches social media management as an execution challenge rather than a tooling challenge. Its AI-powered social agents operate as a distributed, brand-trained workforce – planning, publishing, and engaging on behalf of hundreds to thousands of locations across multiple social channels.
Unlike platforms that assist human workflows, SOCi’s agents are designed to autonomously execute local social work at scale, while adhering to brand standards, governance rules, and local nuance. This shifts the operational burden away from both corporate teams and local managers.
As part of an integrated platform spanning social, search, reviews, and local brand sentiment, SOCi enables multi-location brands to manage customer experience holistically rather than in isolated silos.
Best for:

Enterprise, multi-location brands managing hundreds to thousands of locations across multiple social channels that require consistent, hyper-local execution with minimal manual oversight.
SOCi is best suited for organizations that view social media as part of a broader local customer experience ecosystem, and want to integrate social execution with insights from search performance, reviews, and local brand sentiment rather than managing each channel in isolation.
Birdeye: AI-Assisted Local Publishing with Bird AI
Birdeye’s Bird AI focuses primarily on AI-assisted content creation and publishing. It helps teams generate localized posts more efficiently and streamline scheduling across locations.
While Bird AI improves speed and consistency, execution and optimization still depend on human teams. AI functions as an assistant within existing workflows rather than an autonomous operator.
Best for:

Smaller brands or SMB-focused teams seeking faster local publishing through AI-generated content, while retaining hands-on management of social execution. 
Yext + Hearsay: Social, Compliance, and Intelligence for Regulated Industries
Yext and Hearsay are now part of the same company and are best evaluated together as a unified platform. Their combined offering emphasizes governance, compliance, and intelligence, particularly for highly regulated industries.
Social media is positioned as part of a broader digital presence strategy, with strong controls, approval workflows, and oversight. AI is primarily used for intelligence and risk management rather than autonomous execution.
Best for:

Brands in highly regulated industries, such as financial services or healthcare, that are primarily focused on social media compliance and risk management, with strong governance, approvals, and oversight.
Yext + Hearsay is well suited for organizations that need compliance-first social controls. Brands looking to manage compliance as part of a broader local experience ecosystem spanning social execution, search visibility, reviews, and local brand sentiment may find SOCi better aligned to that integrated operating model.
Sprinklr: Enterprise Social Orchestration Across Global CX Operations
Sprinklr is a broad, enterprise-grade platform designed for global organizations managing complex, multi-channel operations. Its AI agents and AI Plus capabilities support orchestration, analytics, and workflow optimization across a wide CX ecosystem.
That breadth can deliver significant power, but often requires dedicated platform teams, extensive configuration, and ongoing management to support day-to-day social execution.
Best for:

Large global enterprises with mature operations and resources to manage a highly configurable, enterprise-wide platform.
Sprinklr is best suited for organizations managing complex, top-down workflows and analytics, but it is not purpose-built for day-to-day local social media management workflows across hundreds or thousands of locations.
Sprout Social: Centralized Social Management with Productivity-Focused AI
Sprout Social is well suited for centralized brand teams managing publishing, engagement, and reporting across multiple profiles. Sprout AI enhances productivity by improving content suggestions, summarizing engagement, and streamlining workflows.
For deeply distributed brands, however, execution still relies heavily on human teams coordinating activity across locations.
Best for:

Centralized marketing teams managing social media for multiple brands or regions, rather than autonomous local execution.
What Sets Execution-First Platforms Apart
Across the platforms evaluated, clear patterns emerge.
Most social media platforms for multi-location brands fall into one of three categories:

AI-assisted publishing tools that help teams create content faster
Intelligence and compliance platforms that prioritize oversight and risk management
Enterprise orchestration platforms designed to coordinate complex global operations

Each approach solves part of the problem. But for multi-location brands, the challenge is cumulative: social work must be planned, localized, published, governed, and optimized continuously across every location.
Execution-first platforms are designed to solve this entire workload by shifting responsibility from human teams to autonomous agents. Over time, this difference compounds, reducing operational burden while improving consistency, speed, and visibility.
Choosing the Right Platform Depends on How the Work Gets Done
In 2026, the most important question isn’t which platform has the most features.
It’s:

Who is responsible for day-to-day execution?
How much manual oversight is required?
How scalable is the model as locations grow?
Does the platform reduce work or simply reorganize it?

Platforms optimized for assistance and intelligence can be effective. Platforms built for execution fundamentally change how social media operates at scale.
Final Takeaway: Social Visibility Requires More Than Software in 2026
For multi-location brands, social visibility is no longer a periodic marketing task – it’s continuous operational work.
AI has expanded what platforms can do, but outcomes depend on how that AI is applied. Tools that assist teams still rely on human capacity. Platforms designed for autonomous execution shift the burden away from teams entirely.
Evaluating social media platforms through this lens makes it clear which approaches are best suited for the realities of multi-location brands in 2026.
See How Agentic Social Execution Works for Your Brand
Every multi-location organization has a unique footprint, governance structure, and operational complexity. The most effective way to evaluate an execution-first approach is to see how it applies to your specific brand.
A personalized SOCi demo shows:

How brand-trained social agents execute work across your locations
How governance, approvals, and local relevance are handled automatically
What social visibility looks like when execution no longer depends on human bandwidth

If you’re evaluating platforms for multi-location social media management in 2026, a personalized demo can help determine whether an agentic workforce model aligns with how your team wants the work done.

				SOCi and Sprinklr are frequently evaluated side by side by large, complex organizations. Both platforms serve enterprise customers. Both invest heavily in AI. And both promise to help brands manage social media at scale.
But despite surface-level similarities, SOCi and Sprinklr are built to solve very different customer experience problems; differences that become critical for brands managing social media across hundreds or thousands of locations.
This comparison focuses on how each platform approaches social media execution for multi-location brands, and why that distinction matters when visibility depends on continuous, localized work across hundreds or thousands of locations.
Why SOCi and Sprinklr Are Often Compared
At a high level, SOCi and Sprinklr appear in the same enterprise conversations for good reason:

Both support large organizations
Both emphasize governance and control
Both incorporate AI into their platforms

However, they come from different origins and design philosophies. Sprinklr was built to orchestrate complex, global customer experience operations. SOCi was built to execute local marketing work at enterprise scale.
Understanding that distinction is key to choosing the right platform.
The Core Difference: Enterprise Orchestration vs. Multi-Location Execution
The most important difference between SOCi and Sprinklr isn’t feature depth or AI sophistication, it’s where customer experience is managed and how work gets done.

Sprinklr is designed to orchestrate people, teams, workflows, and channels across a global enterprise.
SOCi is designed to execute ongoing local marketing work autonomously across every individual location.

In practice, this means Sprinklr excels at scaling global brand content and messaging across a wide range of social channels, while SOCi is designed to create, publish, and scale localized social content and engagement across hundreds or thousands of individual location pages with embedded corporate guardrails and minimal manual effort.
How Sprinklr Approaches Social Media Management
Sprinklr is a powerful enterprise platform built for organizations with complex, multi-channel customer experience needs. Social media is one component of a broader brand-level CX ecosystem that includes care, insights, advertising, and analytics.
Sprinklr excels when customer experience is designed, governed, and measured primarily at the national or global level, rather than executed independently at each location.
Where Sprinklr excels

Extensive customization and workflow configuration
Advanced analytics and data aggregation
Support for global brands, regions, and business units
AI agents that assist with optimization, routing, and insights

For organizations with dedicated platform owners and operational teams, Sprinklr can provide deep visibility and control across social activity.
Tradeoffs to consider
That breadth comes with increased complexity. While Sprinklr provides strong orchestration and insight, social execution still relies on teams to plan, publish, and manage content across locations.
Sprinklr is not purpose-built for creating, posting, and scaling localized content and engagement across hundreds or thousands of individual location pages with minimal manual effort. As location counts grow, so does the operational overhead required to maintain consistency and responsiveness.
How SOCi Approaches Social Media Management
SOCi was purpose-built for multi-location brands where customer experience and messaging need to happen at the local community level, and where social media is a continuous, distributed workload.
Rather than focusing on workflow orchestration, SOCi’s AI-powered social agents are designed to execute the work itself – planning localized content, publishing posts, and engaging on behalf of every location while adhering to brand standards, governance rules, and local nuance.
Unlike platforms designed to manage teams, SOCi is designed to replace operational effort with autonomous execution.
What this enables

Consistent, hyper-local content across all locations
Embedded governance without manual approvals
Minimal day-to-day platform management
Scalable execution as locations grow

This model reflects how customers actually experience brands through the local store, branch, or community, not through corporate social accounts.
AI in Practice: Optimization vs. Autonomous Execution
Both SOCi and Sprinklr use AI, but for very different jobs.
Sprinklr’s AI model

Enhances analytics and insights
Optimizes workflows and routing
Supports teams with recommendations and automation

AI improves how teams work, but teams remain responsible for local execution and ongoing management.
SOCi’s AI model

Executes planning, publishing, and engagement
Adapts to brand rules and local context
Learns and improves over time

AI becomes the workforce, not just the assistant.
The Operational Reality at Scale
For multi-location brands, the difference between orchestration and execution becomes more pronounced over time.
As locations increase:

More workflows must be configured
More people are needed to manage activity
More effort is required to maintain consistency

Platforms that rely on human execution scale linearly with headcount. Platforms designed for autonomous execution scale without adding operational burden.
This is where execution-first models deliver compounding value.
When Sprinklr Is the Better Fit
Sprinklr can be the right choice for organizations that:

Operate globally across many channels
Require deep CX orchestration beyond social media
Manage primarily national or brand-level messaging
Design, govern, and measure customer experience at the national level, with centralized ownership
Prioritize control and customization over simplicity

For these organizations, Sprinklr’s breadth and flexibility, particularly for national-level customer experience management, can outweigh the operational cost.
When SOCi Is the Better Fit
SOCi is a better fit for organizations that:

Operate hundreds or thousands of locations
Need consistent local execution without relying on local labor
Want to reduce operational overhead as they scale
View social media as ongoing local work, not a managed workflow
Compete on local visibility, relevance, and community presence

SOCi is best suited for brands where messaging and customer experience need to be delivered and experienced at the local community level, rather than managed primarily at the national brand level. For these multi-location organizations, this distinction is decisive.
Final Takeaway: Choosing Between Control and Execution
Choosing between SOCi and Sprinklr ultimately comes down to where your customer experience lives, nationally or locally, and how you want social media work handled.

Sprinklr excels at orchestrating complex teams, workflows, and brand-level CX operations.
SOCi excels at executing local social work autonomously at scale.

For multi-location brands where social visibility depends on continuous, localized execution, an execution-first platform fundamentally changes what’s possible.

The best way to evaluate SOCi and Sprinklr is to see how each platform applies to your specific footprint, governance needs, and operational reality.
A personalized SOCi demo shows:

How brand-trained social agents execute work across every location
How governance and local relevance are handled automatically
What social visibility looks like without manual execution

									Reputation Management
				
									Protect Your Brand Reputation at Scale
				
									Shoppers are more skeptical than ever, with 91% of shoppers checking reviews before making an in-store purchase decision. Ignoring reviews or generic replies undermines shopper trust.  SOCi responds to every review in your brand voice, instantly. Positive reviews are amplified, sensitive ones are flagged for corporate, and negative reviews are addressed quickly, preventing issues from escalating.
The result: Every interaction builds trust, strengthens loyalty, and ensures your store is the one they choose.

									Social Media Management
				
									Keep Every Store Active and On-Brand
				
									73% of customers discover brands on social. But when stores post off-brand, recycle corporate content, or stay silent, you lose visibility and trust. SOCi automatically generates fresh, local, on-brand content so that every store shows up authentic, visible, and chosen.
The result: Every store stays connected to its community, while corporate keeps full brand control.

				“Reputation management tells a story that is important to every store. Our goal is to ensure every guest receives a positive response and address any negative experiences promptly, but we were spread thin trying to keep up with reviews while also managing other aspects of our business,” said Southern Rock Restaurant’s Director of Marketing and Digital Activation, Carrie Spencer.
Southern Rock Restaurants (SRR), a major franchise operator in the GoTo Foods brand portfolio, operates 156 McAlister’s Deli restaurants across thirteen states and is expanding. The sheer volume of reviews SRR receives — over 25,000 a month — and the round-the-clock nature of online guest interactions made maintaining a stellar online reputation, essential in the fiercely competitive hospitality industry, almost impossible for the SRR team to process manually. The team also struggled to consistently post social media content at scale for franchisees to effectively engage with customers on various platforms and networks.
Just one month after launch, SRR was able to respond to 148% more reviews than it had previously. This increase in guest engagement translates directly into enhanced customer satisfaction and loyalty. Timely and meaningful brand responses matter because 94% of consumers use reviews to make local buying decisions.


“Genius exceeds our goals for responses and is forward-thinking in how it responds. It’s easy with human interaction to make mistakes but with Genius, there are no mistakes, no responses are ever the same, and we don’t have to use templated responses anymore. We can redirect our efforts towards creating compelling content, maintaining other technology, and conducting regular audits.”
Southern Rock Restaurant’s Director of Marketing and Digital Activation, Carrie Spencer


 
Uniquely, Genius Reviews helps SRR identify product issues inside of reviews and stay on top of quality control, especially when stores have limited-time offers. The added security measures and spam identification capabilities provide peace of mind, safeguarding the brand’s reputation to ensure they aren’t responding to spam reviews.
SRR also utilizes SOCi Social to address inconsistent social media posting. With a scalable way to post localized content for all franchisees across multiple networks, SRR increased its posting frequency by 900% on Meta in just 90 days, leading to an impressive 48% increase in engaged Facebook page users. By prioritizing customer engagement and efficiency, SRR exemplifies the transformative power of SOCi and SOCi Genius in helping the brand better know and understand its customers and overcome online reputation management challenges.
When businesses respond to customer reviews, 50% of customers report feeling satisfied that the response was helpful and met or exceeded expectations. Implementing SOCi Genius Reviews, SRR has cut its review response time by 55% and achieved an impressive 99% response rate within 24 hours. Spencer was even able to respond to a backlog of over 107,000 historical reviews by herself, amidst her other responsibilities.


“SOCi Genius Review’s automated response capabilities and brand voice consistency were game-changers. It offers the efficiency we desperately need and allows us to work smarter, not harder, in managing our online reputation.”
Southern Rock Restaurant’s Director of Marketing and Digital Activation, Carrie Spencer
 


							

			
	

			
			
				
					
            
    
        
        
                            SOCi Results
SRR’s journey shows the value of Genius Reviews and SOCi Social in delivering tangible benefits apparent in the following results, including:

SRR now has automated 1-star review responses to ensure timely responses and escalations.


Over 107,000 historical reviews were never responded to or even seen. Utilizing SOCi’s tools, SRR responded to all of these in a matter of weeks.
Time to respond to reviews has decreased from 10 days to 4.5 days.
SRR has built a custom report to flag certain reviews to allow easy sentiment tracking based on keywords mentioned.

					Product Q&A
				
			
			
									
						
							How is Genius Search Agent different from Genius Search?
							
						

						
							Genius Search is a powerful do-it-yourself solution: your team logs in, reviews AI suggestions, and decides what to publish. Genius Search Agent relies on that same data foundation as Genius Search but creates a dedicated, brand-trained Genius Search Agent for every single location, so each location’s listings, posts, and SEO optimizations are handled continuously and contextually. Instead of spending time inside dashboards, you simply review the high-impact changes the Genius Search Agents flag for approval. Updates go live the moment data shifts, so every location stays accurate and discoverable without waiting on busy staff.


						
					
									
						
							Can Genius Search Agent work without my involvement?
							
						

						
							Yes. You set the workflow. Updates can publish automatically, be routed for approval, or use a hybrid approach — giving you the flexibility to choose full automation, hands-on review, or both.


						
					
									
						
							How do I know Genius Search Agent won’t make mistakes with my brand?
							
						

						
							Every action follows the rules and directives you set. You control the voice, tone, and approval process, so updates stay aligned with your brand standards.


						
					
									
						
							How does SOCi Shield help keep Genius Search Agent compliant?
							
						

						
							Shield is built into SOCi’s Genius Platform to enforce brand and regulatory standards across local search, social, and reputation. Genius-generated updates are always compliant by default, and Shield also scans user-created content and edits in real time–flagging issues and blocking risky changes before they publish.


						
					
									
						
							What results can I expect to see?
							
						

						
							You’ll get clear reporting on what changed, where it changed, and the impact on rankings, traffic, and engagement. While SEO is an ongoing process and can fluctuate, the Agent accelerates improvements and helps you act on opportunities faster than manual work ever could.


						
					
									
						
							Can it manage multiple locations at once?
							
						

						
							Absolutely. Genius Search Agent was built for multi-location scale. Whether you manage dozens or thousands of listings, Genius Search Agent helps you maintain accuracy and optimization everywhere without adding headcount.

				SummaryManaging business listings may work manually at small scale, but once a brand reaches 100+ locations, the cracks start to show. Without a centralized system, location data becomes inconsistent, harder to update, and increasingly risky for search visibility and brand trust. This blog breaks down why listings management fails at scale—and how centralization solves it.
Managing business listings becomes unmanageable once a brand reaches roughly 100 locations. What starts as routine updates to hours, addresses, and categories quickly becomes an operational risk tied to visibility, accuracy, and brand consistency.
At enterprise scale, listing ownership spreads across regions, franchisees, agencies, and internal teams. Without a single source of truth, updates move unevenly, approvals vary, and changes propagate inconsistently across search platforms and directories. The result is conflicting location data, limited auditability, and growing exposure during acquisitions, rebrands, seasonal changes, or closures.
This article breaks down what actually fails at enterprise scale in listings management, why SMB-focused tools fall short, and what a centralized, governance-first approach must support to maintain trust and entity clarity across every location.
What managing business listings looks like at 10 vs. 100+ locations
Managing business listings across multiple locations often looks simple on a small scale. With a limited footprint, informal workflows still hold together.
At this stage, listings updates typically happen through a mix of hands-on effort and lightweight coordination:

Regional or brand operations teams log into Google Business Profile, Facebook, and a small set of priority directories when changes are needed
Local managers update hours, phone numbers, or holiday closures directly
Shared spreadsheets track addresses, credentials, and recent edits

Errors happen, but they remain visible and relatively contained.
That operating model breaks once brands move past 100 locations and listings management shifts from an occasional task into a core operational function.
Update volume increases quickly. Seasonal hours overlap with staffing changes, relocations, acquisitions, and temporary closures across regions. Brand operations teams, shared services groups, agencies, and franchise partners all touch the same location data. A single incorrect update can ripple across hundreds of locations or introduce duplicate listings that persist for months.
At this scale, listing management becomes a coordination challenge. Teams struggle to establish ownership, validate accuracy, and track changes across platforms. Routine questions—what changed, who approved it, and where it propagated—become difficult to answer. Without audit trails or centralized oversight, isolated errors compound into systemic visibility gaps across search and discovery channels.
What breaks when listings management scales past 100 locations
Managing business listings at enterprise scale breaks down because governance cannot keep pace with distributed ownership. Without a centralized system, updates fragment across platforms, audit trails disappear, and inconsistent data weakens trust and entity resolution across search and AI-driven discovery.
These failures reflect broader realities of multi-location listings management as brands expand faster than their operational controls.
Governance collapses without centralized control
Listings governance rarely fails in a single moment. It degrades as ownership spreads across regions, agencies, franchisees, and internal teams.
Approval paths differ by market or disappear entirely. Local teams update listings to move faster, often without visibility into brand standards or downstream impact. Over time, corporate teams lose the ability to trace what changed, who approved it, or whether updates align with policy. Accuracy shifts from a governed process to individual behavior, making consistency difficult to maintain.
Data fragmentation becomes the default state
Listings data drifts as updates apply unevenly across platforms. Google, Apple, Facebook, Yelp, and data aggregators begin reflecting different versions of the same location. Addresses, hours, phone numbers, and categories diverge gradually, then noticeably.
When platforms receive conflicting signals, locations become less likely to surface for intent-driven queries, especially in proximity-based searches where accuracy directly influences relevance.
Spreadsheets and shared docs fail as systems of record
Spreadsheets often persist long after they stop functioning as reliable systems of record. Teams rely on them to track location data, credentials, and update status, even though they have no connection to live listings.
Without real-time sync, validation, or audit trails, these documents quickly become outdated. During rebrands, acquisitions, or seasonal changes, teams reference files that no longer reflect what customers see in search results. The gap between internal records and live listings is widening at the moment; accuracy matters most.
Updates stop propagating consistently
Execution breaks down even when teams make the right changes.

Some directories update immediately, while others lag or revert
Data aggregators overwrite recent edits weeks later
Teams lack confirmation that changes persisted across every platform

Without confidence that updates are held, issues surface only after visibility drops, customer confusion increases, or reporting flags a problem. Listings management becomes reactive rather than proactive, with fixes chasing failures rather than preventing them.
Why SMB listings tools fail at enterprise scale
Listings tools built for small businesses assume a narrow ownership model. One person or a small team controls updates, makes changes directly, and moves quickly without formal oversight.
That assumption breaks once listings management becomes shared across regions, agencies, franchise partners, and internal teams.
At enterprise scale, tooling assumptions start working against the brand. This becomes especially visible in AI-driven discovery. Large language models (LLMs) tend to favor small and independently owned businesses over chains and franchises when data signals are unclear or inconsistent. When enterprise brands rely on SMB-oriented tools, they amplify fragmented signals instead of correcting them, reinforcing the disadvantage rather than closing it.
The problem isn’t speed. It’s governance.
SMB tools prioritize execution while leaving controls outside the system. Access permissions remain shallow. Approval paths are limited or missing. Brand standards live in documents and playbooks instead of inside the workflow that governs updates. As location counts rise, listings management shifts from a task into an operational system, but the tooling never makes that transition.
Teams compensate manually. Corporate groups review listings after changes occur rather than managing accuracy upstream. Audits happen in samples instead of across the full footprint. Errors surface as performance drops, customer complaints, or reporting flags, rather than through prevention.
At enterprise scale, this operating model becomes fragile. Accuracy depends on human vigilance rather than embedded controls, and the effort required to maintain consistency grows faster than the organization can realistically support.
How listings failures impact trust and entity resolution in AI-driven discovery
Listings accuracy influences more than traditional local rankings. It shapes how search engines and AI systems decide whether a location is credible, distinct, and worth surfacing at all. When listings break at scale, the impact extends beyond visibility into how a brand is understood as an entity.
Inconsistent data weakens trust signals. When hours differ across platforms, addresses vary slightly, or categories shift by location, discovery systems receive mixed inputs. At a small scale, those inconsistencies may be overlooked. Across hundreds of locations, they become patterns that reduce confidence in the data as a whole.
AI-driven systems rely on reconciliation rather than assumption. They compare information across directories, maps, data aggregators, social platforms, and owned properties to determine whether records represent the same real-world location. Duplicate listings introduce uncertainty about ownership. Mismatched names or addresses complicate entity matching. Category drift blurs how the business should appear for intent-driven queries.
Research reinforces the sensitivity of this process to data quality. SOCi’s The Factors Driving AI Visibility report found that large language models vary widely in business data accuracy, with performance ranging from the mid-60% range to near-complete accuracy depending on the consistency of underlying sources. When listings data fragments, representation becomes unpredictable across AI systems.

That uncertainty has direct visibility consequences. The same SOCi report shows that brand locations are recommended only 17.6% of the time in AI-generated results, compared to 23.6% visibility in Google’s traditional local 3-Pack.
<img decoding=""async"" class=""wpa-warning wpa-image-missing-alt aligncenter size-full wp-image-36304"" src=""https://sociai-www.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06101819/few-businesses-recommended.png"" alt="""" width=""669"" height=""423"" data-warning=""Missing alt text"" srcset=""https://sociai-www.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06101819/few-businesses-recommended.png 669w, https://sociai-www.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/06101819/few-businesses-recommended-300x190.png 300w"" sizes=""(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px"" />
In environments where AI returns a single answer instead of a ranked list, inconsistent listings data reduces the likelihood of being selected at all. There is no secondary result to recover visibility once trust signals break down.
At enterprise scale, listings accuracy functions as infrastructure. It supports local visibility, influences whether locations are referenced in AI-generated responses, and reinforces brand credibility at the entity level. When that foundation degrades, discovery performance reflects it quickly and unevenly.
What an enterprise-grade listings management approach requires
Once listings management becomes a shared responsibility across hundreds of locations, success depends on structure rather than effort. Enterprise teams need systems designed to manage change at scale, maintain consistency under pressure, and reduce reliance on manual intervention.
Platforms built specifically for enterprise-scale, such as SOCi, treat listings management as governed infrastructure rather than a collection of individual profiles.
A centralized source of truth
Accuracy starts with clarity. Enterprise listings management requires a single, authoritative intelligence layer that defines what is correct for every location.
Brand standards cannot live solely in documents or training. They need to operate directly within the system that governs listings updates. When location data is managed centrally, teams reduce variation, eliminate conflicting records, and avoid the informal handoffs that introduce drift—often weeks later during aggregator refresh cycles.
Scalable governance and permissions
As participation expands, ownership must remain explicit. Enterprise workflows depend on clear roles that separate who can propose changes from who can approve them.
Corporate, regional, and local teams require different levels of access without slowing execution. Governance should guide updates forward while discouraging workarounds that emerge when approval processes feel disconnected from daily operations.
Continuous accuracy across every directory
Listings accuracy degrades quietly. Directories refresh on different schedules. Data aggregators overwrite fields long after updates are made. Platforms revert changes without warning.
Enterprise teams managing business listings across multiple locations cannot rely on periodic cleanups. Accuracy requires ongoing monitoring that detects drift as it happens and corrects it before visibility or customer trust takes a hit. Coverage must extend beyond a short list of directories to prevent gaps from forming across the broader listings ecosystem.
Auditability and accountability
Once listings become enterprise infrastructure, change history becomes operationally critical.
Brand operations leaders, shared services teams, and compliance stakeholders need visibility into what changed, when it happened, and how it aligned with policy. During acquisitions, legal reviews, franchise disputes, or closures, teams rely on auditability to confirm that updates followed approved workflows and applied consistently across hundreds or thousands of locations.
How an agentic workforce model changes listings management at scale
Traditional listings workflows assume teams will manage change manually. That model breaks once brands manage business listings across multiple locations at enterprise scale.
An agentic workforce approach treats listings maintenance as continuous operational work rather than a periodic task. With SOCi, each location operates under a brand-trained AI agent that applies centralized governance rules and maintains accuracy across directories without requiring corporate teams to intervene location by location.
The shift is operational, not conceptual.
Instead of shared services teams logging into platforms or reconciling spreadsheets, maintenance runs continuously in the background. Agents monitor for data drift, reconcile discrepancies introduced by aggregators, and correct issues before they surface in reporting or customer experience. Standards hold across regions and ownership models, while visibility remains stable across search and AI-driven discovery environments.
Common enterprise scenarios where centralized listings matter most
Centralized listings management becomes critical during moments of change. These are the situations where distributed ownership and manual workflows fail fastest, often with immediate impact on visibility, customer trust, and downstream performance.
Mergers and acquisitions
New locations enter the ecosystem with inconsistent data, duplicate listings, and inherited errors. Without centralized control, teams struggle to reconcile naming conventions, addresses, and categories across platforms, leaving discovery systems to interpret conflicting signals during periods of heightened scrutiny.
Brand refreshes or renaming initiatives
Name changes, updated descriptions, and category shifts need to appear consistently across every directory. When updates roll out unevenly, outdated brand identities persist in search results, creating confusion and weakening entity clarity long after the transition ends.
Seasonal hours and temporary closures
Retail, food, healthcare, and service brands frequently adjust their hours. When changes propagate unevenly, customers encounter closed locations marked as open or outdated hours displayed across maps and listings, triggering avoidable complaints and trust erosion.
Rapid expansion or market exits
New locations introduce both volume and complexity. Closures introduce risk when listings are not updated or suppressed correctly. Without centralized oversight, outdated locations linger in discovery environments, pulling attention away from active markets and distorting performance reporting.
Crisis situations requiring immediate updates
Weather events, safety issues, or operational disruptions demand fast, coordinated action. During disruptions, inaccurate listings often surface alongside negative customer feedback, amplifying frustration and creating reputational impact that persists after operations return to normal.
Key takeaways for enterprise marketing and operations leaders
Managing business listings across multiple locations becomes increasingly complex as brands grow. Success at enterprise scale depends on systems that support control, visibility, and accountability across hundreds or thousands of locations.
Several realities define that shift:

Listings accuracy relies on centralized intelligence rather than isolated updates
Execution must operate continuously as platforms refresh and data shifts
Trust and entity clarity weaken when location data varies across directories
Multi-location brands require systems designed for enterprise operating models, including shared services, brand operations teams, and franchise structures

For marketing and operations leaders, listings management functions as infrastructure. Control, visibility, and accountability need to live inside the workflow itself. Without that foundation, inconsistencies compound, visibility declines, and discovery performance reflects the gaps. Enterprise brands increasingly turn to platforms like SOCi and purpose-built business listings management software to manage listings as governed infrastructure rather than an ongoing clean-up effort.

                Afif is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of SOCi, and has been at the forefront of technology for over 25 years.
With a BS in Neuroscience and Genetics from UC San Diego, and a JD from Northwestern University School of Law, Afif has enjoyed a decorated career as a scientist, an attorney, a venture capitalist, and founder of two successful startups—including SOCi, which he has built to a 7-time Inc.5000 Fastest Growing Company in America and G2-ranked Top 5 Marketing Platform in the World.
Afif is now passionate about changing our relationship with software, from a tool to a partner that can be trained to do the work for us. To that end, SOCi has recently released the CoMarketing Cloud, an autonomous data analytics and marketing platform that is changing the martech landscape.

3. THE SERVICES
3.1 Updates and Modifications.  SOCi reserves the right to modify, enhance, adapt, discontinue, or change the Services, including any features or functionalities thereof, at our discretion to improve performance, ensure compliance with applicable law, or to align with the requirements of Networks or our partners. Such changes will be subject to the following terms:

Notification: We shall endeavor to provide advance notice of changes that, in our sole judgment, may materially adversely affect your use of the Services. For changes affecting a limited number of customers or for emergency updates necessary to maintain the integrity of the Services, notice may be provided through in-app updates or email notifications.
New Features and Functionality: Any new features or functionality that are added to the Services and made generally available may be subject to additional terms, acceptance of which will be required for use of such features or functionality. If applicable, additional fees for new features or functionality shall be agreed upon via a signed Order Form and/or amendment or addendum to these Terms of Service.
Continuity of Services: While we strive to maintain the availability of all Subscription Services, we do not guarantee the provision of any specific Subscription Service, product, pricing, or feature beyond the Subscription Term stated in your current Order Form.
Third-Party Services and Networks: Your Subscription Services may include the use of Third-Party Services (as defined in Section 3.7 below) or Networks which may incur additional fees (“Pass-through Fees“). You acknowledge and agree that changes in Third-Party Services pricing that is invoiced by SOCi may necessitate adjustments to the Pass-through Fees associated with your Subscription Services.

3.2 Data Maintenance and Backup Procedures. The SOCi Platform is not intended to be a failsafe data warehouse or data backup solution. In the event of any loss or corruption of Customer Content (including Derivative Content), we will use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the lost or corrupted Customer Content from the latest backup of such Customer Content maintained by us. You acknowledge that full restoration of Customer Content may not be possible under all circumstances.  As the custodian of your Customer Account, you should independently back up your personal data, to the extent permitted herein and by applicable laws and regulations.  For clarity, any Customer Content, External Content, or Derivative Content that have been published to the Networks, that is exclusive to the Networks remains unaffected in the event of corruption or loss of Customer Content, External Content, or Derivative Content via the Services.
3.3 Use of SOCi Shield.  SOCi Shield enables you to set up specific parameters to regulate the content that your Users publish on the Networks via our Platform (“SOCi Shield”).  SOCi Shield does not guarantee compliance with your internal company posting policies or any legal requirements applicable to regulated industries and your business. We will not be liable or responsible to you for any failure by you or your Users to comply with laws applicable to your business or industry resulting from your use of SOCi Shield.  
3.4 Use of Surveys.  SOCi’s Surveys (“Surveys”) feature allows you to create and send surveys to your customers, clients, or visitors to your website. If your Subscription Services include the use of Surveys, you acknowledge and agree that you will not create survey questions resulting in survey responses that include Restricted Information. This includes any Output generated by the AI Services, as defined below.
3.5 Professional Services.  From time to time, you may engage SOCi to provide certain Professional Services, such as marketing services, implementations, integration, testing, custom modifications, or other consulting services.  Each such engagement of Professional Services will be described in an Order Form that must be accepted in writing by an authorized representative of each Party. SOCi shall own all rights, title, and interest in and to any custom modifications or work created, designed, developed, invented, or made by SOCi (or its contractors) under Professional Services.
3.6 Subcontracting and Partner Engagement. SOCi may engage third-party subcontractors or partners to enhance the delivery and implementation of our Services. This approach allows us to leverage specialized expertise and maintain high standards of service quality.

Subcontractor Engagement: SOCi retains the right to utilize third-party subcontractors for the execution of certain tasks related to our Services. These subcontractors will be selected based on their demonstrated ability to meet SOCi’s standards for quality and security.
Customer Direct Contracting: Customers may have the opportunity to engage directly with SOCi-approved implementation partners. These partners are carefully vetted to ensure they align with our operational standards and service commitments. However, any agreements between customers and direct partners are independent of SOCi, and SOCi is not responsible for the performance of these partners.
Disclosure of Subcontractors: A current list of SOCi’s subcontractors, including any implementation partners, is maintained and accessible for review at www.soci.ai/subprocessors.
Transparency and Consent: SOCi is committed to transparency regarding the use of subcontractors and partners.

Any new Locations or Services added during the Subscription Term will be charged at the then current Fees, prorated based on the remaining months in your Subscription Term.  Fees are exclusive of all taxes, including national, state, or provincial and local use, sales, value-added, property and similar taxes, if any.  You agree to pay such taxes (excluding US taxes based on SOCi’s net income) unless you have provided us with a valid exemption certificate.
4.2 Payment Method.  You may receive invoices and make payments in any manner agreed upon with SOCi via a signed Order Form.  If you have elected to make payments via credit card, charge card, debit card, or financial institution account (herein “Payment Method”) for all charges to your accounts with SOCi, then you hereby authorize SOCi to charge your Payment Method for the Fees.  When you provide a Payment Method to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that Payment Method and you also authorize our third-party payment processor to receive, collect, and store your Payment Method information, along with other related transaction information.  When you make a purchase, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the Payment Method you designate for the transaction. You agree to submit any disputes regarding any invoices related to your account in writing to SOCi within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the invoice, otherwise, such dispute will be waived, and such invoice will be final and not subject to challenge.
4.3 Payment Failure and Suspension.  If your Payment Method fails or your account is past due, and you have not cured such failure to pay within thirty (30) days of written notice of any past due amounts, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your account upon demand and reimburse us for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted, (ii) we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms (this includes charging other payment methods on file with us) and (iii) we reserve the right to either suspend access to, deactivate, or terminate and delete your SOCi Account and User Accounts, including all Services and any User Accounts you have with us.  We are not responsible for any loss or damage to you or any third party that may be incurred as a result.

Right to Terminate: You may terminate the impacted Subscription Services by issuing a change order to your existing Order Form, provided such termination is exercised within thirty (30) days from the notice of the reduction or elimination of functionality. Such notice must be delivered to SOCi in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of termination.
Cure Period: SOCi shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of your notice of termination to cure the reduction or elimination of functionality. If SOCi cures the degradation within this period, the right to terminate shall not apply.
Refunds: In the event of termination due to uncured degradation, SOCi will issue a prorated refund, for fees prepaid but not yet used as of the notification date, corresponding to the impacted Subscription Service for the remainder of the applicable Subscription Term.

5.4 Termination for Cause.  Either Party may terminate these Terms of Service and all Services and Order Forms upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event of a material breach unless such breach is cured during the notice period.  If termination is due to SOCi’s uncured material breach, SOCi will reimburse you for Fees prepaid, but not yet used as of the termination date.  If termination is due to your uncured material breach, you shall remain obligated to pay all Fees owed (whether paid or payable) for the remainder of the Subscription Term showing on your then-current Order Form.  Notice of any material breach must be provided within thirty (30) days from learning of the material breach, for this Section 5.4 to be applicable. Either Party may immediately terminate these Terms of Service upon written notice to the other Party (i) upon the institution by or against the other Party of insolvency, receivership, or bankruptcy proceedings, (ii) upon the other Party’s making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) upon the other Party’s dissolution or ceasing to do business.

SOCi shall not be liable for loss of any such data due to termination or non-renewal of the Services or these Terms of Service.  In no event will the expiration or termination of these Terms of Service relieve you of any obligation to pay Fees applicable to the Subscription Term for any applicable Order Form prior to the date of termination.
5.6 Survival.  Rights to accrued payments, remedies for breach, and Sections “Ownership; Content Rights,” “Disclaimer,” “Limitations of Liability,” “Indemnification,” “Interpretation,” and “Miscellaneous,” and this Section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms of Service.
6. CONFIDENTIALITY
6.1 Confidentiality.  SOCi and you may exchange certain confidential information (“Confidential Information”).   Confidential Information may include (i) non-public information about SOCi’s pricing, personnel, or partnerships, our product roadmap, our security and data protection documentation, or other non-public information we identify as confidential; (ii) non-public information about your marketing plans, social media strategies, products, expansion opportunities, or such other non-public information you identify as confidential; and (iii) non-public information disclosed by either Party to the other Party, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or to which the other Party may have access, which (a) a reasonable person would consider confidential, or (b) is marked “confidential” or “proprietary” or some similar designation by the disclosing Party. Confidential Information does not include Customer Content publicly published to the Networks or other such business information that is already publicly available via the Networks or a third-party site. Information will not be considered Confidential Information if (i) it was lawfully in the receiving Party’s possession before receiving it from the disclosing Party; (ii) it is provided in good faith to the recipient by a third party without breaching any rights of the disclosing Party or any other party; (iii) it is or becomes generally available to, or accessible by, the public through no fault of the receiving Party; or (iv) it was or is independently developed by the receiving Party without reference to the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.
6.2 Confidentiality Obligations. During the Term and for a period of three (3) years after expiration or termination of these Terms of Service, neither Party shall make the other’s Confidential Information available to any third party or use the other’s Confidential Information for any purposes other than exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement.  Neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information except to such Party’s advisors, accountants, attorneys, investors (and prospective investors), and prospective acquirers that have a reasonable need to know such information, provided that any such third parties shall, before they may access such information, either (i) execute a binding agreement to keep such information confidential or (ii) be subject to a professional obligation to maintain the confidentiality of such information. Each Party shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the other’s Confidential Information is not disclosed or distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the terms of this Agreement, but in no event will either Party use less effort to protect the Confidential Information of the other Party than it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of like importance. Each Party will ensure that any agents or subcontractors permitted to access any of the other’s Confidential Information are legally bound to comply with confidentiality obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information may be disclosed as required by any governmental agency, provided that before disclosing such information, the disclosing Party must provide (to the extent permitted by applicable law) the non-disclosing Party with sufficient advance notice of the agency’s request for the information to enable the non-disclosing Party to exercise any rights it may have to challenge or limit the agency’s authority to receive such Confidential Information.

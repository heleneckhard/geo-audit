Turning wasted spend into pipeline that actually closes
Converting MQLs into demos and trials that move fast

									Increase pipeline in 90 days 
without bloated budgets or big teams
													Our Predictable Growth Model drives millions of dollars of SaaS revenue for our clients every single month. Imagine what your life would be like if you could deliver and hit revenue focused results to your boss every quarter this year. You’d be employee #1. 
							
		
					
			
				
				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															Get in front of your ICP every time
							
							
								
									Fill pipeline with right-fit customers. Grow LTV.


								
							
							
															Most SaaS teams waste budget chasing clicks from people who will never buy. We flip that. Our system makes sure when your ideal buyers are in-market, your brand is the one they think of first.
Here’s how:

Create demand — Only attract decision-makers who fit your ICP. No more junk leads.
Build authority — Position your brand as the obvious choice in your category.
Fill the funnel — Turn traffic into demos and demos into revenue with a system that compounds over time.

See how we get permission from great-fit prospects to go deeper with our clients

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															Engage your ICP
							
							
								
									Make your buyer an offer so irresistible they can't turn it down


								
							
							
															Buyers drop off because your offer isn’t clear or compelling enough. Fix that, and signups and demo requests stop stalling.
Here’s how we build content + offers that move buyers from “maybe” to “booked demo”:

Pinpoints Pain – Speak directly to the problems that keep them up at night. If they don’t feel you “get it,” they won’t buy.
Educates and motivates prospects – Show prospects the mistakes they’re making and the upside they’re missing.
Calibrates call-to-actions – Every piece of content points to the next step: demo, trial, or deal. No fluff, no dead ends.

See how we develop content that supports the whole buyer journey

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															Higher customer lifetime value
							
							
								
									Multiply ROI by locking in customer revenue for much longer


								
							
							
															Most SaaS teams live on the hamster wheel: spend more, chase more, burn more. The winners stack channels, compound LTV, and watch CAC drop every quarter.
Here’s how we build a system that multiplies revenue over time:

Stack strategies – Paid, SEO, and demand gen working together to multiply impact, not cannibalize it.
Drives dealflow​ – Turn qualified traffic into demos, trials, and sales-ready opps on repeat.
Compresses time​ – Continue marketing after the lead converts, so leads turn into Opportunities faster.

									How our B2B SaaS clients are adding millions in pipeline revenue every quarter


								
							
							
															Here’s the brutal truth about most B2B SaaS businesses right now:
Everyone is concerned about the economy. Demand is shaky. Buyers are cautious. Almost every marketing leader is being asked to re-evaluate their marketing spend to see what they can do to grow by the same amount but with fewer resources.
It’s rough out there. But there’s no need to panic.
Our clients have great SaaS products, with low churn rates, and sticky retention, and they’re growing reliably even in the current economy.
So if you are worried about how to hit your company’s growth goals next year despite having a leaner team and less to spend, keep reading.
What does it take to continue to grow during an economic downturn? It’s not easy.
Your SaaS marketing efforts must build authority in your marketplace, create content that educates and motivates prospects, and promote it in the right place (organic and paid marketing channels) at the right time, with the right offer.
Having an offer to book a demo or start a trial as a one-size-fits-all strategy on your home page won’t cut it, and neither will the latest growth hack that is abused ad infinitum.
Or, instead of tactics that only work some of the time, you can invest in getting some Predictable Growth by working with our SaaS marketing agency.
The best part? it’s a simple 3-step framework.
It’s not easy, but it is straightforward.
In over 10 years of working with B2B SaaS companies, this is the fastest way we’ve found to quickly grow your demos and trials using organic and paid traffic.

			How Powered by Search Helped iWave Achieve a 7-Figure Revenue Growth from Paid Media in Under a Year
		
							
			
						
							
											The Challenge
						Generating predictable pipeline from paid channels
When iWave approached Powered by Search, they needed help hunting the marketing world’s white whale: generating sustainable and measurable growth from paid investments.
iWave hadn’t had success with previous agencies that had failed to deliver long-term return on investment (ROI). They turned to Powered by Search because they needed a proven methodology to generate lasting and scalable results.
Jill McCarville, the VP of Marketing at iWave, recalls,
“We switched from an agency that wasn’t generating as much pipeline revenue as we could have been generating.”
Jill was also dissatisfied with the former agency’s opaque reporting. iWave’s marketing needed to know what was working and what needed to change. They needed full-funnel visibility to guide optimization efforts, and clear reporting to prove the ROI of paid campaigns to key stakeholders.
“We weren’t happy with the previous agency’s reporting. We didn’t have visibility into the number of leads that were turning into customers,” Jill says.
By switching, Jill hoped to generate more Marketing Qualified Leads and Sales Qualified Leads, build out strategies to turn those MQLs and SQLs into demo sign-ups, and gain more transparency into every step of the process.
But just as importantly — Jill wanted a partner that would help iWave establish itself as a market leader. They needed someone to implement a methodology that would help them consistently drive demos through paid and organic sources.
Jill says, “Powered by Search is made up of subject-matter experts who are laser-focused on SaaS and metrics, and that’s exactly what we were looking for.”
“We were working with an agency that wasn’t generating as much pipeline revenue as we thought we should have or could have been generating.”
																The Solution
						Proven and predictable lead scaling methodology
How did Powered by Search help where other agencies had failed? Using the Predictable Growth Methodology, Powered by Search worked with iWave to create a strategy that would scale iWave’s MQLs, SQLs, and ultimately pipeline revenue.
The first move was a strategic messaging shift. Repositioning iWave’s solution as ‘fundraising software that turns data into donations,’ helped iWave better anticipate their customer intent and get in front of their target audience.
Repositioning and redefining iWave’s messaging underpinned all of the growth efforts that followed. It accelerated demand generation in a big way and set the foundation for the future success of all paid and organic strategies.
Next, Powered by Search helped iWave create and execute ad campaigns to attract perfect-fit leads. Jill and her team were thrilled with the transparent and thoughtful process—and the quick results.
“We are really happy with how Powered by Search manages and optimizes our paid media accounts. We have biweekly calls where we go through results and brainstorm, their recommendations are usually on point,” she says.
An in-depth SEO audit uncovered gaps in iWave’s current strategy. The audit revealed a lot of ripe content opportunities and one huge untapped area for improvement: the website.
Overhauling the website and amping up its technical SEO, would help iWave dominate their niche and maximize organic discovery.
“Powered by Search has made great changes to optimize our SEO. There’s a lot more optimization to be made, but we’re on the right path,” Jill says.
Before long, Powered by Search was running paid media, SEO, and managing the start-to-finish building and migration for the new website. The massive project is still ongoing—but the early results have been amazing.
Specifically: paid media is now consistently one of iWave’s highest-performing channels!
“I’ve never worked with an agency like Powered by Search where I felt like every person was really strong in their area of expertise. I’d have trouble moving to another agency,” Jill says.
“We are really happy with how Powered by Search manages and optimizes our paid media accounts. We have biweekly calls where we go through results and brainstorm, their recommendations are usually on point.”
																The Results
						Consistent revenue growth year-over-year
The strategies that Powered by Search helped iWave create and manage now consistently exceed every paid media and MQL/SQL goal they set. Individual KPI results include:

278% paid media revenue growth year-over-year
251% lead volume growth between Q1 and Q4
3X increase in MQLs within first two quarters

“We completely turned around our results within 12 months of partnering with Powered by Search. Now, we exceed our KPI targets every month,” Jill says.
Comparing the results of our partnership vs. the experience with the previous agency, Jill says that there’s a dramatic difference in paid media performance across the board.
“For example, we tried different tactics on Linkedin with previous agencies, but it wasn’t a successful channel. It wasn’t until we switched to Powered By Search that Linkedin became a successful channel that generates MQLs, SQLs, and significant pipeline,” she says.
Having access to detailed and verifiable reports enables Jill to track ongoing optimization efforts and share the results with stakeholders. She now recommends Powered by Search to her peers.
“I 100% recommend Powered by Search. They’ve completely transformed our paid media strategy. The results are incredible and we’re extremely happy with them,” she says.

Sick of trying to do it yourself with limited, short-term results

Ready to commit to a digital marketing system that reliably generates leads and sales

Our Ideal Client

Wants to become a digital-first business, but has challenges strategically acquiring prospects from digital channels, engaging them to stick around, and profitably converting them into their best customers.

They’re:

Willing to have us in the driver’s seat by inviting us to — decide which symptoms are relevant, diagnose the problem accurately, and prescribe the best solutions that can lead to real change but minimizes disruption as much as possible.
Quick to connect and share wins and challenges, and quick to implement recommendations.
Responsible for themselves. This means showing up on time, being prepared, and owning problems and solutions.
Value-focused and have no hesitation about the investment involved to turn their ideas into action, and confusion into clarity. They happily grow with us as their company grows, because not hiring us is much more expensive than doing so.

			How We Helped Make TouchBistro the Number 1 iPad POS in 35 Countries
		
							
			
						
							
											The Challenge
						As a foodservice iPad Point of Sale (POS) System, TouchBistro is a part of a highly competitive market. Similar services come and go on in the blink of an eye, and they didn’t want to be seen as yet another pretender when they came to us. TouchBistro offers exquisite and powerful POS solutions, so the challenge was to get this information in front of potential customers. When we got in touch, they were struggling with their search engine visibility, didn’t rank for their desired keywords, and sought to generate more leads.
We knew that it would take a massive effort to make TouchBistro stand out in such a crowded marketplace, and our experienced team relished every aspect of it. With TB’s full backing, we developed a goal out of our joint vision: to drive more leads for TouchBistro, make them easily discoverable on Google, and boost their app performance with App Store Optimization.
																The Solution
						From previous experience, our team knew what a challenge TouchBistro’s goals posed, so we started with what we do best; an in-depth SEO audit. This audit enabled us to learn more about TB and strategically informed all of our digital marketing recommendations.
Once our grand audit was completed, we were able begin improving TouchBistro’s online presence. We started with strategic on page optimization, moved onto landing page recommendations. and we worked tirelessly to build quality links towards the brand. The on page optimization helped organic search traffic and general visibility, whilst the new landing pages created a more localized, relevant, and positive user experience.
However we knew that SEO alone wouldn’t cut it for the POS industry. That’s why our paid search experts jumped in. We created and optimized new paid search campaigns that clearly communicated TouchBistro’s powerful features and value. Our campaigns were highly relevant and the ads received excellent quality scores from Google which in turn allowed us to make the most out of our available resources.
Example of a Facebook Ad in action.
With the combination of our SEO efforts and highly optimized paid search campaigns, we increased TouchBistro’s year over year traffic by 1400% (that’s not an extra zero), and brought in 67% more paid search leads.
Furthermore, our social media marketing team identified some untapped Facebook potential. We developed a new campaign to focus on TouchBistro’s many benefits to restaurants that were still stuck using pen and paper. The entire theme was “new” vs “old” in order to show restaurant owners that they could improve their business. We tested the new creative and copy against the the old, and quickly found that the new campaign was resonating strongly. In fact, April 2016 became a record month for TouchBistro since investing in Facebook advertising, with 135 leads generated.
Example of high converting Facebook creative.
With an increase in search engine performance and lead acquisition, we continue to passionately work with TouchBistro, and every day we get closer to making them the go-to POS for the foodservice industry. In fact, they’re already the #1 iPad POS for restaurants in 35 countries.
																The Results
						
Increased TouchBistro’s year over year traffic by 1400%.
Brought in 67% more paid search leads.
Created a more localized, relevant, and positive user experience through SEO efforts.
Provided 135 leads in one month from Facebook advertising – a record for the company.

		We grow your portfolio with our predictable demand gen programs for private equity backed B2B SaaS firms Are you a principal or partner at a growth-focused PE firm who have just acquired a new B2B SaaS company? Do you want to shortcut your learning curve to show the progress that you need to hit your IRR targets?
Hiring isn’t an option here. After all: ramping up a new marketing exec could take a year. 
Before you know it, you’re behind schedule on your 5 year cycle and you don’t know why. 
You need to find out what the problem is and set up a predictable growth model to get back on track. 
Or maybe you’re setting up your portfolio company 18 months out from being acquired. Your traction to date is so-so and to get the multiple you want you’re going to need to paint a picture of how marketing gets traction. 
If those sound familiar, you’re in a similar position to other partners at private equity firms who’ve hired Powered By Search to create a demand gen system that delivers predictable growth for their portfolio companies. 
Firms like: 

PointClickCare (J&F, Dragoneer, JMI)
TouchBistro (Barclay, JP Morgan, Relay)
Loopio (Sumeru, OpenView)
TitanGPS (HKW)
HelpSystems (Charlesbank, TA, Summit)

Hire a B2B SaaS marketing agency that delivers for private equity partners. Every time.
Bringing a SaaS marketing agency in to ramp up growth and marketing in your portfolio companies is a mixed bag. We hear this time and time again. 
You might get lucky and find someone who can provide PPC, SEO, branding and positioning agencies together. 
But the problem is: even then, they don’t speak the same language as you or your board. 
The disconnect between the channel expertise that those agencies can provide and the strategic, business related outcomes you need is huge.
When you’re looking to hit your goals, what you don’t need is someone who just tells you that your cost-per-click is too high and that they can lower it. 
If they say ‘it depends’ when you ask them a strategic question. 
Fire them right away. 
What you really need is someone who can talk to you, your board and your finance people and say: ‘If you invest x amount in this area of the marketing, you’re going to see y result which will produce z result across the next 18 months.’ 
Why Powered By Search is the right growth partner for your portfolio companies
One of the key problems with hiring a marketing agency for B2B SaaS demand gen is that so many horizontally integrated agencies exist. 
Sure, they provide all the services that you’re looking for in a marketing agency. But they’ve got none of the expertise. 
Because growing a B2B Saas is nothing like growing a services business. They don’t understand how to factor payback periods into their attribution models. They’ve got no clue how to calculate the downstream ROI of investing in SEO. 
They can’t point to a playbook of their experience and say: that’s how we’re going to get you the results you need for your firm. 
On the other hand, we exclusively work with B2B SaaS and so we’ve developed a methodology that works. We call it the predictable growth model.

Through this model we uncover strategic opportunities to create massive business growth and then achieve those through a strategic and tactical approach to SEO, PPC and Positioning. 
You can read more about how the strategy and model works here
This is the system that we’ve used to grow private equity backed companies like PointClickCare, TouchBistro and Loopio and take them to their next funding round.
Where do you go from here?
Our systematic approach to B2B SaaS growth adds millions of dollars in ARR for our clients every single year. 
The process is not easy to execute but it is straightforward, and it requires intelligence, curiosity, the know-how, and perseverance of marketers and their stakeholders to follow through.
If you’re ready to discuss bringing your portfolio companies to work with us, we’d welcome the conversation. 
The next step is to book in a call with our team where we’ll:

		Account Based Marketing (ABM)How we can help you land your dream customers with our holistic Account-Based Marketing approach.
Our team has a track record of growing B2B, SaaS, and technology businesses with a targeted Account-Based Marketing (ABM) approach.
We have grown software and technology companies with ABM using the following techniques:

Account-Based Marketing Strategy that holistically ties together positioning, full-funnel content and offer architecture, content strategy, and analytics and attribution modelling
Avatar and Persona Mapping that enriches your ABM list based on the key personas, influencers, and stakeholders who are involved in the awareness, consideration, and purchase stages of evaluating your products and solutions.
Market Research and ABM List enrichment where our team will research social networks like Linkedin, and Facebook, plus directories such as AngelList and Crunchbase.
Company, Role, and Technology-Based Paid Advertising where we tap into solutions like Terminus, Linkedin Ads, and Quora Ads.
Traffic acquisition to get right-fit prospects including building the strategy and executing campaigns on Paid Media channels including Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, Instagram, and Linkedin Ads.
Organic SEO strategy, implementation, and optimization including structuring your website to maximize your discoverability for specific verticals, industries, and use cases that prospects in your ABM target list would find educating and motivating.
Content creation, creating interactive assets such as infographics and calculators, and content promotion. We also offer an exclusive case-by-case basis Digital PR and link building service.
Marketing automation strategy and implementation so that you can nurture cold prospects and turn them into warm leads that you educate and motivate on autopilot.
Copywriting, creative direction and production so that you never have to deal with ad fatigue.

What you’ll get

Your entire Account-Based Marketing operation outsourced to us, in the hands of experts who’ve done this for over a decade.
Benefit: Most in-house marketers are spread too thin and want to work with in-depth wisdom of what to do, in the right order, to get the maximum result. We’ll create a complete demand generation strategy that attracts, engages, and converts your ideal avatars, from click to customer.
Extensively researched customer avatars enhanced with real-world data sourced directly from your customer database, backed by input from your team, and codified to become an asset that enhances your company’s traction.
Benefit: You’ll get right-fit traffic from ideal prospects instead of poorly targeted traffic that reduces your conversion rate and increases your cost of acquisition.
A comprehensive roadmap including demand generation initiatives prioritized by highest impact and lowest effort, with the least dependencies so you can get results fast.
Benefit: You’ll have the peace of mind of knowing that you’re investing in the most effective plan possible to scale your demos and trials. We rebalance the plan every quarter in advance of our Quarterly Business Review with clients.
Forecasts for your future growth included expected traction, acquisition cost estimates, and business cases for appropriate funding.
Benefit: You’ll have all the tools necessary to predict your growth, plus you’ll keep your CFO happy.
Regular consulting and guidance on your monthly and quarterly plans, including review meetings with your consulting team to discuss insights, importance, impact, and client-consultant input sharing.
Benefit: You’ll gain access to multiple subject matter experts in design, copywriting, conversion, and traffic acquisition to augment your team’s existing capabilities.

ROI and Investment
Here is why so many software and technology companies choose to hire us to grow their companies.

Proven Results — For every $1 invested in our consulting fees, we drive $5 of ARR on average.
Higher Value — We produce bigger, better, and more effective results than an internal team or competing generalist firm or agency.
Outcomes, not Effort — We don’t report on vanity metrics like traffic or impressions. All we care about is driving more demos and trials that actually grow your business.
Fast Ramp Up — Our service pays for itself and demonstrates results within 90 days of working together, which is significantly faster than new in-house hires.
Specialized Experience — Our clients view us as their fractional CMO. We’ve already made the mistakes your new hires will make in their first 6 to 12 months many years ago. You can benefit from our wisdom by steering clear of what not to do.


We can help if you are…

A high growth company that knows it can make a bigger impact, if only you had more customers
Ready to make your digital marketing a permanent, thriving part of your culture
Sick of trying to do it yourself with limited, short-term results
Eager to be recognized and pursued as a national or global leader in your industry
Ready to commit to a digital marketing system that reliably generates leads and sales

Everyone internally talks about mapping content to the buyer stages, but few people, few agencies can really execute on the actual content that will actually drive next step demo requests in a way that Powered by Search can.”

									FAQs
										You’ve probably got a lot of questions. The best way to get them answered is to get a free marketing plan – we'll cover your questions when we speak. But here’s the answers to some of the most common questions just in case.
		
				
							
											
							How is Powered by Search different from other SEO agencies for SaaS?
						    
						    	Most agencies are focused on driving totally pointless results like increased traffic or keyword rankings. Powered by Search starts every engagement by asking the question:
“How can we get your revenue from where it is to where it needs to be?”
Additionally, our predictable growth methodology is based around creating a flywheel that aligns the work of organic channels with paid channels and general demand generation work.
No other agency is able to take your investments and grow them holistically.

						    
					  	
											
							What kinds of companies are a good fit for us?
						    
						    	If you’re a B2B SaaS ready to commit a minimum $7500 a month on marketing for a minimum of 1 year, have strong product market fit and want to make building demand a priority, we can help you scale MRR at record-breaking speeds

                              We hear you - SaaS startups have been burned by agencies before and you don’t want to be next
                                      Does “trust us, we’re different. We won’t burn you.” sound familiar?
There are many agencies out there that leave startups feeling disappointed and no further ahead after wasting precious time and money.
At Powered by Search, we let the results speak for themselves.

                                You’ll get to meet the team before we start working together. In fact, we insist on it.
Tired of talking to smart agency founders on sales calls only to be handed off to a well meaning junior team that you have to manage strategy and implementation for?
You’ll get direct access to senior B2B SaaS marketing experts in demand generation, SEO, and paid media. The same core team that leads our enterprise and Cloud 100 SaaS clients.

You don’t need to drive strategy yourself or have an in-house head of marketing. We’ll own the strategy, drive the plan, and execute the actions.
We combine the right processes, people, and playbooks to get to your goal at your budget level, without compromising on talent, momentum, and quality.

                                You shouldn’t have to wait months to start feeling progress.
Maybe you’ve been burned by agencies reporting on vanity metrics like impressions or CTR – we don’t work like that. Trials, activations, closed deals. That’s what we care about.
We get to work fast and lay the foundations for long term success in the first few weeks.

									FAQs
										You’ve probably got a lot of questions. The best way to get them answered is to reach out for your Free Marketing Plan. But here’s the answers to some of the most common questions just in case.
		
				
							
											
							I’ve tried working with agencies before and didn’t get results. Why are you different?
						    
						    	Maybe you won’t get the results you want from us, but that might not be because of us. It could be because of product:market fit, or gaps in your AARRR funnel beyond acquisition. When you get your Free Marketing Plan we’ll set clear expectations so you can decide if we’re the right fit for you.

						    
					  	
											
							You seem to work mainly with enterprise SaaS. Is my startup going to be small for you?
						    
						    	We work with B2B SaaS teams of all sizes. To help you decide if we’re the right fit for your startup, we offer flexible budgets and terms to customize a program that works for you.

						    
					  	
											
							Will I be working with the same people over the entire engagement?
						    
						    	Our average team tenure is higher than most agencies. Your core team consists of full-time consultants, not outsourced resources that come and go.

						    
					  	
											
							Do I need to sign a long term contract?
						    
						    	No. We’re a team of long term thinkers and love working with clients that believe in long term predictable growth rather than short term growth hacks. But we also offer flexible budgets and terms to meet your needs.

						    
					  	
											
							I’m a founder without a marketing team. Can we still work together?
						    
						    	Yes! We can serve as your entire marketing team by owning both strategy and implementation. All we ask for is regular communication so we know that our results are achieving your vision.

						    
					  	
											
							Can you help me if I’m bootstrapped?
						    
						    	Yes! When you meet with us for your Free Marketing Plan we’ll discuss flexible scope, budget, and term to fit your funding situation so your investment with us is ROI positive.

						    
					  	
											
							Can you help me if I’m pre-revenue or if I don’t yet have product:market fit?
						    
						    	Unfortunately, no. Our marketing programs are not designed for pre-revenue or pre-PMF teams. Instead, we offer a self-guided course and regularly publish industry leading content in our blog and newsletter to help where we can until you’re ready to work with us.

						    
					  	
											
							What should I expect when we start working together?
						    
						    	Early action is important to us so that the time to results is as reasonably short as possible. We focus on progress & momentum in the first 100 days, ramping performance and validating strategy in the first 3-6 months, and scaling ROI in the first year. We’ve published a full walkthrough here.

They consistently delivered backlinks that met our specific criteria, and they adjusted quickly to feedback.

When you work with an agency, it’s quite an intimate relationship, so you’ve got to work with people you trust. When we looked for a SaaS marketing agency, I felt we had that with Powered by Search, we thought that was a win for us.

Most B2B SaaS companies want to create a demand generation flywheel.



Those that have one bring in a steady stream of marketing qualified leads. Meanwhile, those that don’t often hit a plateau with customer growth.



Building the momentum to get that flywheel spinning is the hardest part. This is usually because:




They feel overwhelmed about what they should do. There are so many tactics that it’s difficult to choose which to prioritize and act on.
They lack a cohesive strategy to connect their digital marketing activities to work together in a system.
Their SaaS marketing team is consumed with day to day operations and doesn’t have the bandwidth to step back and identify the key roadblocks to overcome.




These are a few reasons why we created the Predictable Growth Methodology (our marketing strategy playbook) to help B2B SaaS companies become unstoppable.
We use an eight step strategy that begins with evaluating MRR accelerators, customer pain points and current blockers and then we design a flywheel for growth that connects various marketing channels to work together to efficiently move prospects through the buyer journey.
You can learn more about how we build B2B SaaS marketing strategies here, though in this article, we’ll teach you the steps to create your own flywheel.
Specifically, we’ll cover:




How to clarify your positioning with a unique tool we created for B2B SaaS businesses.
The ideal way to structure your website map using our Authority Architecture Framework.
The elements that blog posts need to signal relevance to Google’s ranking algorithms.
Why technical search engine optimization, content marketing, and outreach comprise our 3 pillars of focus for SEO strategy.
An explanation of customer-channel fit and why it matters for PPC advertising.
The value of creating bottom-of-funnel content first.
The qualities of good and bad lead magnets.
How to develop email lifecycle campaigns to nurture prospects.
Creating an accurate, and actionable marketing forecast to confidently hit your goals.




After reading this article, you should have a deeper understanding of what to prioritize in your process to generate more demand for your SaaS business.

Positioning Your B2B SaaS Company







If you’re noticing that most customers coming in for demos or trials aren’t a great fit for your product, there’s usually a positioning issue.
Often, SaaS companies have vague positioning statements designed to resonate with all potential customers – and ultimately resonate with none of them.
Many companies and their marketers tend to mistake taglines, slogans, or value propositions as positioning. But they aren’t. Those things come from or are informed by positioning.
Instead, your positioning statement should speak to only your ideal customer profiles and actually repel customers who aren’t a great fit. Tailoring your positioning to one customer persona will help reduce churn and customer support resources while improving reviews and referrals from right-fit customers.



Positioning can be a difficult concept to grasp. It’s often abstract, making it a challenge for many B2B SaaS businesses to define. But, SaaS positioning simply boils down to answering four simple questions:




Who do you help?
How do you differ from your competition?
What problems do you solve?
How does your product work?




Your answers should be brief and precise. If you find yourself and other company stakeholders answering them too broadly, that’s an indicator of unclear positioning.



Also, don’t rely on simply describing your solution. Instead, put your customers at the center of positioning first. Utilize your buyer personas to think hard about the issues and challenges they have that led them to discover you in the first place.



Aside from answering the questions above, we created a tool to help SaaS companies find clarity in their positioning. We call it the SaaS Positioning Canvas and it breaks down into the following steps:




Step 1: Your customers’ desires. What are their fears, frustrations, wants and aspirations? What is the cost of not solving this problem? Understand the obstacles that prevent them from fixing it themselves.
Step 2: The promise. Examine your top 5 competitors and gauge what guarantees they make to your prospects.
Step 3: The premise. Humans are naturally skeptical, which means they’ll likely see your SaaS products first through the lens of doubt. Instead of resisting, address this head on.
Step 4: Difference chunking. Explain how your company gets results for customers in its own unique way. Answer questions centered around strategy, structure, systems, shared values, and style.
Step 5: Market intimacy. List the common mistakes that customers make before using your product. Demonstrate the results you help your customers get relative to increased speed, certainty, and insight.
Step 6: The positioning statement. What’s your reason for existence? Complete the statement: “That’s why we…”
Step 7: The alternative. Detail the outcomes that happen as a result of inaction or not choosing your product.




Nail your positioning first before tackling anything else. By completing the canvas, step-by-step, you’ll have a document detailing what defines your company.



Note: To use this tool, make a copy of the SaaS Positioning Canvas and paste it into your own document to begin filling it out. No need to ask for edit access. (For the canvas to paste properly, go to File > Page Setup > Landscape and adjust the margins from 1” to 0.5” across the board.)



Structuring Your Website for SaaS Demand Generation Success




Many SaaS companies design their websites by committee. They first ask product, engineering, customer success, and sales teams about their needs. Then, they compile random pieces of inspiration from other SaaS websites onto a mood board.



This often results in a website with an identity crisis. Visually, it comes across almost identical to the other SaaS websites. There’s no clear map for prospects to follow on their path to becoming a customer.
For SaaS companies aiming to build a website with clear navigation and a unique identity, using a dedicated website builder for SaaS can streamline the process, ensuring that every page aligns with their brand and user journey.



Seeing this happen far too often, we decided to create a wireframe that visualized our website strategy. The result was our Authority Architecture Framework. It’s a practical site map that details the necessary pages your website should include.



Using this framework can help you build a website that fosters a connection with your visitors. It comprises of focusing your attention and refining your website in the following areas:




Homepage
Product and feature pages
“Who It’s for” pages
Pricing page
About page
Blog page
Resource pages (support, quizzes, contact us)




We’ll cover the three areas of your website that you should address first: your homepage, products and features pages, and your blog. 



Homepages



Every company understands that their homepage has to include a headline. But they often miss the mark when it comes to writing a headline that’s compelling.
Unclear homepages often have high bounce rates as prospects who don’t immediately understand that you have a custom solution for their specific pain point have little incentive to explore deeper into your website.
A simple test to see if the messaging on your homepage is clear is to ask – if we swapped out our logo for a competitors’ logo, would our customers still know that it’s really our brand?
So how do you create a great headline?



The best headlines speak to a specific audience and don’t make plain, declarative statements. They often ask a question instead.



If you decide to make your headline a statement, it’s best to do so by presenting it in a pros-without-cons format. That means declare a benefit and pair it with one of the pain points your product solves, both phrased in positive terms.



Use your subheadline to communicate your value proposition. Your value proposition answers the question: “Why should I choose you over your competition?”.



To achieve this, we use a tactic that we call “the screenwriting technique”.



The screenwriting technique is a method of conveying that “aha moment” your SaaS product delivers once a customer starts using it. Think of the screenwriting technique as a way to demonstrate how they might feel before and after becoming your customer.



Product and Feature Pages
Look at your product and feature pages right now – are they explaining the bells and whistles of your product or explaining how it solves specific customer problems?
The reality is that nobody really cares how cool your product is. They just want to know that it will quickly and reliably solve their problem.
Of course, your product probably has multiple features that solve multiple different pain points which you’ll have to explain. In addition, you’ll have people at different stages in the buyer journey visiting your product and feature pages, and their next action step will differ depending on their current knowledge level (e.g., product aware might sign up for a demo whereas solution aware might want to read some case studies).
So how you structure these product and feature pages will impact your conversion rates.







Companies that don’t pay enough attention to structure, imagery, and copy often have trouble converting visitors through their product and feature pages.



By overlooking these three elements, their product pages tend to suffer from higher bounce rates and often fail to rank in organic search.



To optimize these pages for higher conversions, we break them down into five sections, tackling each one-by-one.



1. The Above the Fold Experience



Before a visitor begins scrolling, a good product page needs to address four questions.




Does the product match what the visitors are searching for?
Can it do what they need and solve their problems?
Would purchasing this product be a worthwhile investment?
And finally, what should they do next?




2. The Trust Badge Banner



A prospect needs reassurance that your product is something they can trust. Including logos of other businesses that also use your SaaS product signals legitimacy to your page visitors. Feature a strategic mix of your most impressive and best fit customers.



3. Detailed Feature Expansion



Use this section to provide more depth and context to the features you’ve listed above the fold. Present features in the order they’re used. Then, leverage the pros-without-cons format we discussed above.



4. The Second Call to Action



Including another call to action serves two purposes. First, it gives a visual break between your product features and benefits. Second, it demonstrates what a prospect would get by opting into your offer.



5. Testimonials



Add another element of social proof. Including testimonials of your best fit customers increases confidence with visitors that your product can provide real help.



Blog Pages








Most B2B SaaS companies invest plenty of effort into web design and conversion rate optimization for their homepage and product pages. But very few dedicate that same amount of attention to their blog.



Blog pages and posts can often become the most visited parts of your company’s site and failing to optimize them for conversion is a missed opportunity.
Traffic is often the main KPI used to measure the effectiveness of blog content, but then companies find that their revenue and lead volume doesn’t correlate with traffic metrics.
One common reason for this discrepancy in lead volume and traffic metrics is because the blog post architecture isn’t optimized to move the buyer through the customer journey. So after a person reads a blog post, they’ll simply leave your website if there isn’t a logical next step for them to take.
Of course, it could also be due to poor customer content fit (which we discuss in detail in our B2B SaaS content strategy process), but assuming you’re producing the right type of content, simply adding the right calls to action in the right places within your blog can significantly improve its effectiveness.



With that in mind, we created a framework for blog pages and posts that helps solve this problem. Turn to the Authority Blog Post Architecture for B2B SaaS for inspiration when creating wireframes for your website.



The framework breaks down into five parts:



1. Header Menu



Many companies make the mistake of including hundreds of options in their dropdown menus for visitors to choose from. We think less is more. Include only the links that are likely to matter most for visitors. Think of your header as an elevator pitch for your value proposition.



2. Blog Post Date



Refreshing existing posts is a commonly practiced SEO tactic. But many companies don’t include an annotation of when they’ve last updated specific blogs. We tell SaaS companies to include when posts are published and when they’re updated because that signals to search engines you’re providing the latest information or take.



3. Sidebar Menu



Declutter your sidebars. Remove various messaging, CTAs, social proofs, and links. Use your sidebar to display a table of contents that visitors can use to jump ahead to certain topics within your articles.



4. Blog Content



Include more calls to actions that you want readers to take within the actual content of an article. Contextualizing them in a post is much more effective because they catch your readers’ eyes while they skim through your posts.



5. Footer Menu



Between the conclusion of your article and your footer, insert a section that tells readers what to do next. This section should include final calls to action that readers could take now that they’re finished reading your post. We recommend including CTAs that correspond to bottom-of-funnel, middle-of-funnel, and top-of-funnel intent.
Note: If your CTAs aren’t converting very well, audit them to make sure you’re only asking the reader to take the next step in the buyer journey. A common mistake we often see is that SaaS companies automatically include a CTA to schedule a demo in their blog posts.
Yet if the blog post is only addressing a problem aware audience, those readers aren’t ready to schedule a demo. So make sure your CTA only asks them to the next logical step in the buyer journey.



Executing SEO for SaaS Demand Generation







We believe that the best way to attack SEO is through a framework-driven, methodical approach. That’s why we break it down into three pillars of focus:




Technical SEO
Content Marketing
SEO Outreach




Let’s walk through the five priorities that matter for each pillar.



Technical SEO



If your website isn’t ranking at all for some key terms, or if you clearly have better content than the top ranking posts yet search engines are still ranking your website much lower, there’s likely a technical SEO issue.
We have a more comprehensive resource on our approach to technical SEO for B2B SaaS, but most issues come down to improving a few key elements.
The first element to tackle here is increasing page level topical relevance. Search engines don’t care about the word count of your article or how many times you mention your target keyword. What matters most is that your page is relevant to the topic that user is searching for.



Next, it’s necessary to decrease website and crawl errors. These can add up when you don’t fix them and makes your content less discoverable by search engines. Limit or get rid of as many of them as possible.



Third, increase time and budget dedicated to faster deployment. Consider how you can break up bigger tasks related to technical SEO so that you can start taking actions faster. If there are cost-related issues, consider finding more support to complete jobs that need finishing.



Fourth is decreasing response time to deploy content changes. Recommendations and ideas are a dime a dozen. They only work if they’re implemented. Make sure changes happen sooner rather than later.



And finally, increasing content and context of web content. Related to increasing topical relevance, search engines favor contextually relevant content.





Content Marketing



Technical SEO lays the groundwork for showing up in search results, but if you don’t have any content that answers search queries, technical SEO will be irrelevant.
That’s why we focus the majority of our SEO resources on content marketing.
Yet unlike many SaaS marketers, our approach to content marketing isn’t just about increasing the volume of content.
In fact, solely increasing content volume is often the root cause of poor SEO performance.
One way search engines evaluate the authority of your website is by analyzing the average engagement of your content. If you have a lot of content published, yet the average piece of content only earns a handful of monthly visits, search engines assume that most of your content is unhelpful to users.
As a result, those pieces actually drag down the authority of your website and hinder the top performing content.
Therefore, our first priority is to consolidate as many existing pages as possible. Combine as many pages and posts that cover similar topics to make each piece of content stronger.
We also remove stale and irrelevant content by redirecting it to other relevant pages. This also helps keep the website lean and improves the average engagement of our blog posts.
Next, update existing content. You probably have a handful of blog posts that are already ranking low on the first page or somewhere on the second page.
So instead of creating brand new content (which may or may not perform well), you’ll see much better returns by simply updating existing content that Google is already ranking. It’s also worth noting that you probably already have content for your highest value keywords, and any additional content you create would target lower value keywords.
You’ll probably actually see a bigger lift in leads by boosting an existing piece of content a few spots in the SERPs than ranking a brand new piece of content first for a lower value target keyword.
Third, always consider how you can enrich the user’s content experience. It should be easy for visitors to navigate through your website. Industry tests suggest that user experience can impact how Google ranks the authority of your website.

SEO Outreach



Google wants to show searchers content from experts, and a major way it determines whether or not you’re an expert is by analyzing how many other authoritative websites link to yours.
So earning links is an important ranking factor.
Yet most link building strategies, like cold emailing thousands of website owners and asking for a link, are unsuccessful and reflect poorly on your brand.
Instead, make a point to build genuine relationships with industry experts and relevant publishers. Connect with influencers who will recommend your brand to their audiences. For example, go on podcasts, contribute to industry publications that your target audience reads, and speak at events.
You may have to do some outreach to land a collaboration, so we always send 2-step personalized outreach emails. When reaching out to influencers, send messages that consider the receiver. How will your request help them and how can you ensure accepting requires virtually no effort on their part?
If they don’t respond to your first email, send a personalized follow-up that clearly sums up exactly what kind of benefit they’ll receive by collaborating with you.
After doing a few collaborations, you’ll find that people will organically begin linking to your brand over time as they reference conversations and quotes from these content collaborations.
Speaking of content, the next best way to earn links is to create your own content worth linking to. Strive to create assets that are so remarkable that people can’t help but talk about or link back to them. If you wouldn’t share your content, then chances are someone else wouldn’t share it either.
Lastly, make an effort to reclaim brand mentions and usages. Anywhere on the web where people mention your brand but don’t link back to you is an opportunity for a new backlink. Use a tool like Ahrefs to create alerts whenever mentions of your brand occur.

Driving PPC Traffic That’s the Right Fit for Your Business
Paid media costs are rising, and many SaaS marketers are feeling the strain as their general metrics are inefficient. They’re usually either paying too much for their leads or simply not getting enough leads for their budget.
Either way, it’s not sustainable and competitors are growing while they continue to tread water.
It’s easy to blame changing market conditions and lament that marketing is becoming more challenging, but we’ve found that there are often a lot of untapped opportunities that marketers can leverage to improve PPC performance.
Specifically, we’ve found that the root cause of most underperforming PPC strategies is usually that they haven’t found customer-channel fit.
This means that you’re either advertising on the wrong channel, or advertising on the right channel in the wrong way.
Of course, figuring out the right channel for each stage of the buyer journey and implementing the right positioning and messaging is tricky.







Effective PPC strategy starts with finding customer-channel fit. This means that your creative matches a user’s behavior and intent on the platform your ads are running. We often see companies make the following mistakes when it comes to finding customer-channel fit:




They’re not testing enough.
They don’t have a workflow that maps out every step from a channel through conversion.
They don’t have remarketing set up from the getgo and fail to use a pixel delay.
They rarely revamp their ad creative.




The three outbound PPC channels we find most effective for B2B SaaS companies are LinkedIn, Facebook (Meta Ads), and Google Ads.



In the next section, we highlight the key rules of thumb for getting the most out of each channel.



LinkedIn Ads



Plan to allocate more budget for LinkedIn ads to be successful. Running ads on LinkedIn are generally more expensive than Facebook (Meta Ads) and Google Ads. You’ll generate fewer yet higher quality leads.



It’s also a great channel for account based marketing as you can upload a list of companies you want to target and then run ads specifically to individuals working at those companies.
Though for any other campaigns, you don’t need to get granular with your targeting on LinkedIn. Specificity isn’t a must. Instead, provide LinkedIn with broad job titles of your ideal prospects.
Then, make your ad creative so that it’s in line with a LinkedIn user’s behavior. Remember that most people who use LinkedIn are there to browse content and network with other professionals. They’re not in a purchasing state of mind, so consider this when deciding what your offer will be. Lead magnet downloads are often more effective than offering trial or demo signups.



Facebook (Meta Ads)
If you’re unhappy with your Facebook (Meta Ads) conversions, it’s often simply because you have the wrong goal.
While Facebook is excellent for capturing awareness and keeping your brand top of mind as users move through the buyer journey, don’t expect to drive direct conversions – LinkedIn is a better channel to accomplish that goal.
So rather than using Facebook to acquire customers directly, use it as a tool to retarget users and keep them engaged. This will help you decrease acquisition costs on higher intent channels, like LinkedIn, when people are ready to make a purchase.



Facebook is a channel where you want your targeting to be specific. Consider setting up your ad targeting to fall in line with these these three main options:




Retarget users whom you’ve already collected pixel data from.
Build lookalike audiences based on existing customer and prospect data. For example, you can create a 1% LAL audience based on customers who have the highest LTV.
Take an account-based marketing approach and narrow your targeting to an exact list of people who represent great fits for your business.




Note that we didn’t include creating custom audiences based on relevant interests and behaviors. Many B2B SaaS companies who go this route find they reach only a small percentage of the right-fit customers. This strategy is more effective for eCommerce companies or businesses that know their ideal customers spend a lot of time on Facebook.
Google Ads & Bing Ads



Google Ads (and similarly Bing Ads) target high purchase intent visitors and are therefore highly competitive. This means they’ll likely be prohibitively expensive if you haven’t dialed in customer-channel fit and accurately positioned your campaigns with the right messaging at the right stage in the customer journey.
There are five tactics that B2B SaaS companies can implement in their next Google Ads marketing campaign:




Targeting In-Market and Custom Intent Segments: These segments enable you to direct Google to show ads to anyone looking for terms that suggest strong purchasing intent within a recent two-week time frame.
Brand Consideration Intent: Target brand keywords that show consideration like brand name + reviews or brand name + discount.
Brand vs. Competitor Intent: Create comparison landing pages that showcase the difference between you and multiple competitors. Then, drive traffic to them targeting comparison-intent keywords.
Google Display Network with Managed Placements: 90% of all internet users see an ad served by Google Display Network. Using managed placements enables you to handpick the specific websites your creatives appear.
Using target account lists: Just like Facebook, use existing customer or pipeline data to bolster your ads. The difference here is that you’d pair your data with keyword targeting to reach a more precise group of potential customers.




Designing Landing Pages That Convert



Once you’ve got your customer-channel fit in order, then you can start tackling landing pages. Most companies tend to do this in the context of top, middle, and bottom of their B2B marketing funnels. But we think it’s better to design landing pages based on whether customers are:




Problem unaware: Prospects don’t yet realize that they have an issue that needs solving.
Problem aware: They know they have a problem and they’re actively seeking a solution.
Solution aware: Prospects know that options exist for fixing their problems and they want to figure out which solutions are best for them.




With that in mind, B2B SaaS companies can create two different kinds of landing page flows. The first one is for problem-unaware and problem-aware users.







The second is for solution-aware prospects.







What About Remarketing and Optimization?



For remarketing, the biggest mistake most B2B SaaS companies make is taking a one-size-fits-all-approach. They don’t often consider that their prospects engage with their brand in very different ways. That usually means they need to see different kinds of messages before they convert.



To address this, we recommend a strategy we call the Boomerang Method. It’s two-step approach that goes as follows:




Step 1: Segment your audience based on the actions and pages they browsed on your website.
Step 2: Amplify your ads through omnichannel remarketing. This means serving your ads across multiple channels to people who’ve already engaged with your brand.




When it comes to PPC optimization, we see many companies make the mistake of making changes to their campaigns far too soon. They’ll wait only a day, week, or even a few hours before they start tinkering with their campaigns. Instead, they need to wait longer, at minimum a month, to establish a baseline for measuring performance.



You can set benchmarks for your PPC ads by using the following calculations.



First, calculate your total ad budget. That formula is: 

Total Ad Budget =Target # of Closed Deals per Month x Target CAC
Next, calculate the total number of clicks you need to reach your acquisition goal. Use the formula: 

Clicks Needed = Goals per Month Needed ÷ Visitor to Goal Conversion Rate
Once you’ve sorted those two metrics out, determine a target cost per click based on average customer lifetime value and the number of closed deals that you’d like to achieve per month. That formula is: 

Target CPC = Total Ad Budget ÷ Target Clicks per Month




Educating and Motivating Prospects







The final phase of SaaS demand generation boils down to your approach to content strategy. It’s important to consider where in the buyer’s journey your prospects are and match that with content most relevant for them. Otherwise, you can waste time creating a piece of content that’s unlikely to convert into actual revenue.



Most companies tend to prioritize creating their content in this order:



Top-of-funnel topics → Middle-of-funnel topics → Bottom-of-funnel topics



We think it’s more effective to do the opposite:
Bottom-of-funnel topics → Middle-of-funnel topics → Top-of-funnel topics
Attack bottom-of-funnel topics first. Doing so enables you to serve prospects who are already searching for a solution to the problem you solve.
Bottom of the funnel content attracts audiences that are actively looking to purchase a product like yours to solve their problem. This means they’re much more likely to convert than a prospect that is just learning about their pain point.
The buyer awareness matrix is a diagram we created to illustrate the types of content that fit each level of a prospect’s problem/solution awareness level.
We use it to prioritize the type of content we create. So we begin by targeting content in the product aware stage (comparison pages, case studies, use case pages, etc.) as they are most likely to convert. Then we move up the funnel to solution aware content (calculators, buying guides, etc.) and then problem aware and finally unaware.

Below we’ll discuss the different types of content at each stage of the buyer awareness journey in more detail.



Bottom-of-Funnel Content



Bottom-of-funnel topics may show little to no search volume, but have much higher conversion rates. Examples of good BOFU content include:




Comparison pages demonstrating how your software stacks up against your competitors.
Alternative to pages inserting themselves into the conversation of other options your competitors’ customers might consider.
Product pages describing the category of the product you deliver or the solution that your target prospect might search for.
Use cases covering specific actions your ideal customers take while using your product.
Case studies demonstrating the results you’ve helped other customers achieve. Prospects who read case studies are at a point where they have genuine interest in your offer, but need assurance before they buy.




Middle-of-Funnel Content



Middle-of-funnel content, on the other hand, has medium search volume and medium conversion rates. The most common kinds of MOFU content are:




Interactive tools giving prospects a preview of what you offer without requiring a full commitment to a trial or demo. Some examples are questionnaires or calculators.
Marketing intelligence pieces establishing the business case for your SaaS product. They provide prospects with the information they need to get decision-makers to sign off on purchasing your product.
Product tour pages similar to proxies for demos and best for companies that offer more than one product.




Top-of-Funnel Content



Finally, top-of-funnel content focuses on keywords with the highest search volume, but lowest buying intent. These pages and blog posts often land the lowest number conversions. Examples include:




Expanded list posts and expert roundups, which are great for prospects first learning about the problem you solve.
Ultimate guides about certain topics that connect to the core use cases of your product.
‘How to’ narrative content that explains how to do something in the context of your product’s features.
Opinion and thought leadership pieces that grab the attention of your target audience by expressing a contrarian perspective. One side of readers will share these pieces because they agree with you, while the other will engage with them because they disagree.




Creating Effective Content Upgrades for Lead Generation



Many companies struggle to create quality content upgrades that their visitors actually want. Weak lead magnet offerings include:




Newsletters, which are often too general and not interesting enough.
Webinar recordings, which many people perceive to be either boring or too long.
White papers, which often come across dry and not useful.




Effective lead magnets have four qualities. They’re simple, actionable, goal oriented, and easy to consume. For example, a list of common mistakes your users make before they buy your product can help your prospects understand what they’re doing wrong and what needs to be fixed.
Essentially, a lead magnet is just a low tech form that shows how your SaaS solves a particular pain point and a problem. So it could be an Excel sheet or calculator that solves some pain point your audience faces.
Often, it’s a precursor to a more powerful feature that your product offers.
Nurturing with Lifecycle Emails
Once you have the prospect’s email, you have to engage them to continue moving them further through the customer journey. Otherwise, they’ll disengage and likely leave for a competitors’ product.
The most effective method we’ve found to engage prospects is to send lifecycle emails.
For example, here’s what a lifecycle email sequence looks like for a trial-led B2B SaaS:

Email 1: Personal Welcome Email From Your Founder
Email 2: Proactive Support Email
Email 3, 4, & 5: New Lead Sequence
Email 6A: Unconverted Trial Email
Email 6B: (Converted Customer): Converted Trial Email

This form of nurturing is highly effective as it’s personal (it goes directly to their inbox) and all of these prospects have already raised their hand and shown interest in your product. You can also segment your list to send them appropriate content depending on the lead magnet they selected.
As an added bonus, it’s relatively low tech and costs next to nothing (just the email marketing software and the copywriter to write the initial sequence).
However, your existing prospects aren’t your only opportunity for increasing revenue.
As we discuss in our B2B SaaS re-acceleration strategies, you can also nurture existing customers by showing them how to use the product more effectively so that you can increase their LTV. You can also send them occasional upsells to further increase their LTV.
Lost prospects and even churned customers are also great outreach opportunities.
Many of them churn simply because they didn’t need the product at that time or their budgets were cut. If you reach out to them at the right time, they may come back and sign up for your product again.
Forecasting & Reporting
Once you have a strategy in place, it can be tricky figuring out how to set realistic goals, and determine the quantity of resources you’ll need to execute your strategy.
Specifically, you’ll have to answer questions like:

What goals you plan to accomplish
The timeline
The budget required
Channels you’ll leverage based on current pipeline metrics

To answer these questions, we build out detailed marketing forecasts.
Specifically, we model out several different scenarios (do nothing, conservative, realistic, optimistic) that show where you’ll land depending on the strategic decisions you make.
You can use our B2B SaaS marketing funnel forecasting template to model out various scenarios for your own company.
This data also gives you the data you need to accurately estimate what you can achieve with the allotted time and resources and therefore win the budget you need from stakeholders if there isn’t any reliable data to show that the strategy you’ve established can produce the predicted results.

Most B2B SaaS companies want to create a demand generation flywheel.



Those that have one bring in a steady stream of marketing qualified leads. Meanwhile, those that don’t often hit a plateau with customer growth.



Building the momentum to get that flywheel spinning is the hardest part. This is usually because:




They feel overwhelmed about what they should do. There are so many tactics that it’s difficult to choose which to prioritize and act on.
They lack a cohesive strategy to connect their digital marketing activities to work together in a system.
Their SaaS marketing team is consumed with day to day operations and doesn’t have the bandwidth to step back and identify the key roadblocks to overcome.




These are a few reasons why we created the Predictable Growth Methodology (our marketing strategy playbook) to help B2B SaaS companies become unstoppable.
We use an eight step strategy that begins with evaluating MRR accelerators, customer pain points and current blockers and then we design a flywheel for growth that connects various marketing channels to work together to efficiently move prospects through the buyer journey.
You can learn more about how we build B2B SaaS marketing strategies here, though in this article, we’ll teach you the steps to create your own flywheel.
Specifically, we’ll cover:




How to clarify your positioning with a unique tool we created for B2B SaaS businesses.

Positioning Your B2B SaaS Company







If you’re noticing that most customers coming in for demos or trials aren’t a great fit for your product, there’s usually a positioning issue.
Often, SaaS companies have vague positioning statements designed to resonate with all potential customers – and ultimately resonate with none of them.
Many companies and their marketers tend to mistake taglines, slogans, or value propositions as positioning. But they aren’t. Those things come from or are informed by positioning.
Instead, your positioning statement should speak to only your ideal customer profiles and actually repel customers who aren’t a great fit. Tailoring your positioning to one customer persona will help reduce churn and customer support resources while improving reviews and referrals from right-fit customers.



Positioning can be a difficult concept to grasp. It’s often abstract, making it a challenge for many B2B SaaS businesses to define. But, SaaS positioning simply boils down to answering four simple questions:




Who do you help?
How do you differ from your competition?
What problems do you solve?
How does your product work?




Your answers should be brief and precise. If you find yourself and other company stakeholders answering them too broadly, that’s an indicator of unclear positioning.



Also, don’t rely on simply describing your solution. Instead, put your customers at the center of positioning first. Utilize your buyer personas to think hard about the issues and challenges they have that led them to discover you in the first place.



Aside from answering the questions above, we created a tool to help SaaS companies find clarity in their positioning. We call it the SaaS Positioning Canvas and it breaks down into the following steps:




Step 1: Your customers’ desires. What are their fears, frustrations, wants and aspirations? What is the cost of not solving this problem? Understand the obstacles that prevent them from fixing it themselves.
Step 2: The promise. Examine your top 5 competitors and gauge what guarantees they make to your prospects.
Step 3: The premise. Humans are naturally skeptical, which means they’ll likely see your SaaS products first through the lens of doubt. Instead of resisting, address this head on.
Step 4: Difference chunking. Explain how your company gets results for customers in its own unique way. Answer questions centered around strategy, structure, systems, shared values, and style.
Step 5: Market intimacy. List the common mistakes that customers make before using your product. Demonstrate the results you help your customers get relative to increased speed, certainty, and insight.
Step 6: The positioning statement. What’s your reason for existence? Complete the statement: “That’s why we…”
Step 7: The alternative. Detail the outcomes that happen as a result of inaction or not choosing your product.




Nail your positioning first before tackling anything else. By completing the canvas, step-by-step, you’ll have a document detailing what defines your company.



Note: To use this tool, make a copy of the SaaS Positioning Canvas and paste it into your own document to begin filling it out. No need to ask for edit access. (For the canvas to paste properly, go to File > Page Setup > Landscape and adjust the margins from 1” to 0.5” across the board.)



Structuring Your Website for SaaS Demand Generation Success




Many SaaS companies design their websites by committee. They first ask product, engineering, customer success, and sales teams about their needs. Then, they compile random pieces of inspiration from other SaaS websites onto a mood board.



This often results in a website with an identity crisis. Visually, it comes across almost identical to the other SaaS websites. There’s no clear map for prospects to follow on their path to becoming a customer.
For SaaS companies aiming to build a website with clear navigation and a unique identity, using a dedicated website builder for SaaS can streamline the process, ensuring that every page aligns with their brand and user journey.



Seeing this happen far too often, we decided to create a wireframe that visualized our website strategy. The result was our Authority Architecture Framework. It’s a practical site map that details the necessary pages your website should include.



Using this framework can help you build a website that fosters a connection with your visitors. It comprises of focusing your attention and refining your website in the following areas:




Homepage
Product and feature pages
“Who It’s for” pages
Pricing page
About page
Blog page
Resource pages (support, quizzes, contact us)




We’ll cover the three areas of your website that you should address first: your homepage, products and features pages, and your blog. 



Homepages



Every company understands that their homepage has to include a headline. But they often miss the mark when it comes to writing a headline that’s compelling.
Unclear homepages often have high bounce rates as prospects who don’t immediately understand that you have a custom solution for their specific pain point have little incentive to explore deeper into your website.
A simple test to see if the messaging on your homepage is clear is to ask – if we swapped out our logo for a competitors’ logo, would our customers still know that it’s really our brand?
So how do you create a great headline?



The best headlines speak to a specific audience and don’t make plain, declarative statements. They often ask a question instead.



If you decide to make your headline a statement, it’s best to do so by presenting it in a pros-without-cons format. That means declare a benefit and pair it with one of the pain points your product solves, both phrased in positive terms.



Use your subheadline to communicate your value proposition. Your value proposition answers the question: “Why should I choose you over your competition?”.



To achieve this, we use a tactic that we call “the screenwriting technique”.



The screenwriting technique is a method of conveying that “aha moment” your SaaS product delivers once a customer starts using it. Think of the screenwriting technique as a way to demonstrate how they might feel before and after becoming your customer.



Product and Feature Pages
Look at your product and feature pages right now – are they explaining the bells and whistles of your product or explaining how it solves specific customer problems?
The reality is that nobody really cares how cool your product is. They just want to know that it will quickly and reliably solve their problem.
Of course, your product probably has multiple features that solve multiple different pain points which you’ll have to explain. In addition, you’ll have people at different stages in the buyer journey visiting your product and feature pages, and their next action step will differ depending on their current knowledge level (e.g., product aware might sign up for a demo whereas solution aware might want to read some case studies).
So how you structure these product and feature pages will impact your conversion rates.







Companies that don’t pay enough attention to structure, imagery, and copy often have trouble converting visitors through their product and feature pages.



By overlooking these three elements, their product pages tend to suffer from higher bounce rates and often fail to rank in organic search.



To optimize these pages for higher conversions, we break them down into five sections, tackling each one-by-one.



1. The Above the Fold Experience



Before a visitor begins scrolling, a good product page needs to address four questions.




Does the product match what the visitors are searching for?
Can it do what they need and solve their problems?
Would purchasing this product be a worthwhile investment?
And finally, what should they do next?




2. The Trust Badge Banner



A prospect needs reassurance that your product is something they can trust. Including logos of other businesses that also use your SaaS product signals legitimacy to your page visitors. Feature a strategic mix of your most impressive and best fit customers.



3. Detailed Feature Expansion



Use this section to provide more depth and context to the features you’ve listed above the fold. Present features in the order they’re used. Then, leverage the pros-without-cons format we discussed above.



4. The Second Call to Action



Including another call to action serves two purposes. First, it gives a visual break between your product features and benefits. Second, it demonstrates what a prospect would get by opting into your offer.



5. Testimonials



Add another element of social proof. Including testimonials of your best fit customers increases confidence with visitors that your product can provide real help.



Blog Pages








Most B2B SaaS companies invest plenty of effort into web design and conversion rate optimization for their homepage and product pages. But very few dedicate that same amount of attention to their blog.



Blog pages and posts can often become the most visited parts of your company’s site and failing to optimize them for conversion is a missed opportunity.
Traffic is often the main KPI used to measure the effectiveness of blog content, but then companies find that their revenue and lead volume doesn’t correlate with traffic metrics.
One common reason for this discrepancy in lead volume and traffic metrics is because the blog post architecture isn’t optimized to move the buyer through the customer journey. So after a person reads a blog post, they’ll simply leave your website if there isn’t a logical next step for them to take.
Of course, it could also be due to poor customer content fit (which we discuss in detail in our B2B SaaS content strategy process), but assuming you’re producing the right type of content, simply adding the right calls to action in the right places within your blog can significantly improve its effectiveness.



With that in mind, we created a framework for blog pages and posts that helps solve this problem. Turn to the Authority Blog Post Architecture for B2B SaaS for inspiration when creating wireframes for your website.



The framework breaks down into five parts:



1. Header Menu



Many companies make the mistake of including hundreds of options in their dropdown menus for visitors to choose from. We think less is more. Include only the links that are likely to matter most for visitors. Think of your header as an elevator pitch for your value proposition.



2. Blog Post Date



Refreshing existing posts is a commonly practiced SEO tactic. But many companies don’t include an annotation of when they’ve last updated specific blogs. We tell SaaS companies to include when posts are published and when they’re updated because that signals to search engines you’re providing the latest information or take.



3. Sidebar Menu



Declutter your sidebars. Remove various messaging, CTAs, social proofs, and links. Use your sidebar to display a table of contents that visitors can use to jump ahead to certain topics within your articles.



4. Blog Content



Include more calls to actions that you want readers to take within the actual content of an article. Contextualizing them in a post is much more effective because they catch your readers’ eyes while they skim through your posts.



5. Footer Menu



Between the conclusion of your article and your footer, insert a section that tells readers what to do next. This section should include final calls to action that readers could take now that they’re finished reading your post. We recommend including CTAs that correspond to bottom-of-funnel, middle-of-funnel, and top-of-funnel intent.
Note: If your CTAs aren’t converting very well, audit them to make sure you’re only asking the reader to take the next step in the buyer journey. A common mistake we often see is that SaaS companies automatically include a CTA to schedule a demo in their blog posts.
Yet if the blog post is only addressing a problem aware audience, those readers aren’t ready to schedule a demo. So make sure your CTA only asks them to the next logical step in the buyer journey.



Executing SEO for SaaS Demand Generation







We believe that the best way to attack SEO is through a framework-driven, methodical approach. That’s why we break it down into three pillars of focus:




Technical SEO
Content Marketing
SEO Outreach




Let’s walk through the five priorities that matter for each pillar.



Technical SEO



If your website isn’t ranking at all for some key terms, or if you clearly have better content than the top ranking posts yet search engines are still ranking your website much lower, there’s likely a technical SEO issue.
We have a more comprehensive resource on our approach to technical SEO for B2B SaaS, but most issues come down to improving a few key elements.
The first element to tackle here is increasing page level topical relevance. Search engines don’t care about the word count of your article or how many times you mention your target keyword. What matters most is that your page is relevant to the topic that user is searching for.



Next, it’s necessary to decrease website and crawl errors. These can add up when you don’t fix them and makes your content less discoverable by search engines. Limit or get rid of as many of them as possible.



Third, increase time and budget dedicated to faster deployment. Consider how you can break up bigger tasks related to technical SEO so that you can start taking actions faster. If there are cost-related issues, consider finding more support to complete jobs that need finishing.



Fourth is decreasing response time to deploy content changes. Recommendations and ideas are a dime a dozen. They only work if they’re implemented. Make sure changes happen sooner rather than later.



And finally, increasing content and context of web content. Related to increasing topical relevance, search engines favor contextually relevant content.





Content Marketing



Technical SEO lays the groundwork for showing up in search results, but if you don’t have any content that answers search queries, technical SEO will be irrelevant.
That’s why we focus the majority of our SEO resources on content marketing.
Yet unlike many SaaS marketers, our approach to content marketing isn’t just about increasing the volume of content.
In fact, solely increasing content volume is often the root cause of poor SEO performance.
One way search engines evaluate the authority of your website is by analyzing the average engagement of your content. If you have a lot of content published, yet the average piece of content only earns a handful of monthly visits, search engines assume that most of your content is unhelpful to users.
As a result, those pieces actually drag down the authority of your website and hinder the top performing content.
Therefore, our first priority is to consolidate as many existing pages as possible. Combine as many pages and posts that cover similar topics to make each piece of content stronger.
We also remove stale and irrelevant content by redirecting it to other relevant pages. This also helps keep the website lean and improves the average engagement of our blog posts.
Next, update existing content. You probably have a handful of blog posts that are already ranking low on the first page or somewhere on the second page.
So instead of creating brand new content (which may or may not perform well), you’ll see much better returns by simply updating existing content that Google is already ranking. It’s also worth noting that you probably already have content for your highest value keywords, and any additional content you create would target lower value keywords.
You’ll probably actually see a bigger lift in leads by boosting an existing piece of content a few spots in the SERPs than ranking a brand new piece of content first for a lower value target keyword.
Third, always consider how you can enrich the user’s content experience. It should be easy for visitors to navigate through your website. Industry tests suggest that user experience can impact how Google ranks the authority of your website.



Note: For more on content marketing strategy, read this article.



SEO Outreach



Google wants to show searchers content from experts, and a major way it determines whether or not you’re an expert is by analyzing how many other authoritative websites link to yours.
So earning links is an important ranking factor.
Yet most link building strategies, like cold emailing thousands of website owners and asking for a link, are unsuccessful and reflect poorly on your brand.
Instead, make a point to build genuine relationships with industry experts and relevant publishers. Connect with influencers who will recommend your brand to their audiences. For example, go on podcasts, contribute to industry publications that your target audience reads, and speak at events.
You may have to do some outreach to land a collaboration, so we always send 2-step personalized outreach emails. When reaching out to influencers, send messages that consider the receiver. How will your request help them and how can you ensure accepting requires virtually no effort on their part?
If they don’t respond to your first email, send a personalized follow-up that clearly sums up exactly what kind of benefit they’ll receive by collaborating with you.
After doing a few collaborations, you’ll find that people will organically begin linking to your brand over time as they reference conversations and quotes from these content collaborations.
Speaking of content, the next best way to earn links is to create your own content worth linking to. Strive to create assets that are so remarkable that people can’t help but talk about or link back to them. If you wouldn’t share your content, then chances are someone else wouldn’t share it either.
Lastly, make an effort to reclaim brand mentions and usages. Anywhere on the web where people mention your brand but don’t link back to you is an opportunity for a new backlink. Use a tool like Ahrefs to create alerts whenever mentions of your brand occur.

Driving PPC Traffic That’s the Right Fit for Your Business
Paid media costs are rising, and many SaaS marketers are feeling the strain as their general metrics are inefficient. They’re usually either paying too much for their leads or simply not getting enough leads for their budget.
Either way, it’s not sustainable and competitors are growing while they continue to tread water.
It’s easy to blame changing market conditions and lament that marketing is becoming more challenging, but we’ve found that there are often a lot of untapped opportunities that marketers can leverage to improve PPC performance.
Specifically, we’ve found that the root cause of most underperforming PPC strategies is usually that they haven’t found customer-channel fit.
This means that you’re either advertising on the wrong channel, or advertising on the right channel in the wrong way.
Of course, figuring out the right channel for each stage of the buyer journey and implementing the right positioning and messaging is tricky.







Effective PPC strategy starts with finding customer-channel fit. This means that your creative matches a user’s behavior and intent on the platform your ads are running. We often see companies make the following mistakes when it comes to finding customer-channel fit:




They’re not testing enough.
They don’t have a workflow that maps out every step from a channel through conversion.
They don’t have remarketing set up from the getgo and fail to use a pixel delay.
They rarely revamp their ad creative.




The three outbound PPC channels we find most effective for B2B SaaS companies are LinkedIn, Facebook (Meta Ads), and Google Ads.



In the next section, we highlight the key rules of thumb for getting the most out of each channel.



LinkedIn Ads



Plan to allocate more budget for LinkedIn ads to be successful. Running ads on LinkedIn are generally more expensive than Facebook (Meta Ads) and Google Ads. You’ll generate fewer yet higher quality leads.



It’s also a great channel for account based marketing as you can upload a list of companies you want to target and then run ads specifically to individuals working at those companies.
Though for any other campaigns, you don’t need to get granular with your targeting on LinkedIn. Specificity isn’t a must. Instead, provide LinkedIn with broad job titles of your ideal prospects.
Then, make your ad creative so that it’s in line with a LinkedIn user’s behavior. Remember that most people who use LinkedIn are there to browse content and network with other professionals. They’re not in a purchasing state of mind, so consider this when deciding what your offer will be. Lead magnet downloads are often more effective than offering trial or demo signups.



Facebook (Meta Ads)
If you’re unhappy with your Facebook (Meta Ads) conversions, it’s often simply because you have the wrong goal.
While Facebook is excellent for capturing awareness and keeping your brand top of mind as users move through the buyer journey, don’t expect to drive direct conversions – LinkedIn is a better channel to accomplish that goal.
So rather than using Facebook to acquire customers directly, use it as a tool to retarget users and keep them engaged. This will help you decrease acquisition costs on higher intent channels, like LinkedIn, when people are ready to make a purchase.



Facebook is a channel where you want your targeting to be specific. Consider setting up your ad targeting to fall in line with these these three main options:




Retarget users whom you’ve already collected pixel data from.
Build lookalike audiences based on existing customer and prospect data. For example, you can create a 1% LAL audience based on customers who have the highest LTV.
Take an account-based marketing approach and narrow your targeting to an exact list of people who represent great fits for your business.




Note that we didn’t include creating custom audiences based on relevant interests and behaviors. Many B2B SaaS companies who go this route find they reach only a small percentage of the right-fit customers. This strategy is more effective for eCommerce companies or businesses that know their ideal customers spend a lot of time on Facebook.
Google Ads & Bing Ads



Google Ads (and similarly Bing Ads) target high purchase intent visitors and are therefore highly competitive. This means they’ll likely be prohibitively expensive if you haven’t dialed in customer-channel fit and accurately positioned your campaigns with the right messaging at the right stage in the customer journey.
There are five tactics that B2B SaaS companies can implement in their next Google Ads marketing campaign:




Targeting In-Market and Custom Intent Segments: These segments enable you to direct Google to show ads to anyone looking for terms that suggest strong purchasing intent within a recent two-week time frame.
Brand Consideration Intent: Target brand keywords that show consideration like brand name + reviews or brand name + discount.
Brand vs. Competitor Intent: Create comparison landing pages that showcase the difference between you and multiple competitors. Then, drive traffic to them targeting comparison-intent keywords.
Google Display Network with Managed Placements: 90% of all internet users see an ad served by Google Display Network. Using managed placements enables you to handpick the specific websites your creatives appear.
Using target account lists: Just like Facebook, use existing customer or pipeline data to bolster your ads. The difference here is that you’d pair your data with keyword targeting to reach a more precise group of potential customers.




Designing Landing Pages That Convert



Once you’ve got your customer-channel fit in order, then you can start tackling landing pages. Most companies tend to do this in the context of top, middle, and bottom of their B2B marketing funnels. But we think it’s better to design landing pages based on whether customers are:




Problem unaware: Prospects don’t yet realize that they have an issue that needs solving.
Problem aware: They know they have a problem and they’re actively seeking a solution.
Solution aware: Prospects know that options exist for fixing their problems and they want to figure out which solutions are best for them.




With that in mind, B2B SaaS companies can create two different kinds of landing page flows. The first one is for problem-unaware and problem-aware users.







The second is for solution-aware prospects.







What About Remarketing and Optimization?



For remarketing, the biggest mistake most B2B SaaS companies make is taking a one-size-fits-all-approach. They don’t often consider that their prospects engage with their brand in very different ways. That usually means they need to see different kinds of messages before they convert.



To address this, we recommend a strategy we call the Boomerang Method. It’s two-step approach that goes as follows:




Step 1: Segment your audience based on the actions and pages they browsed on your website.
Step 2: Amplify your ads through omnichannel remarketing. This means serving your ads across multiple channels to people who’ve already engaged with your brand.




When it comes to PPC optimization, we see many companies make the mistake of making changes to their campaigns far too soon. They’ll wait only a day, week, or even a few hours before they start tinkering with their campaigns. Instead, they need to wait longer, at minimum a month, to establish a baseline for measuring performance.



You can set benchmarks for your PPC ads by using the following calculations.



First, calculate your total ad budget. That formula is: 

Total Ad Budget =Target # of Closed Deals per Month x Target CAC
Next, calculate the total number of clicks you need to reach your acquisition goal. Use the formula: 

Clicks Needed = Goals per Month Needed ÷ Visitor to Goal Conversion Rate
Once you’ve sorted those two metrics out, determine a target cost per click based on average customer lifetime value and the number of closed deals that you’d like to achieve per month. That formula is: 

Target CPC = Total Ad Budget ÷ Target Clicks per Month




Educating and Motivating Prospects







The final phase of SaaS demand generation boils down to your approach to content strategy. It’s important to consider where in the buyer’s journey your prospects are and match that with content most relevant for them. Otherwise, you can waste time creating a piece of content that’s unlikely to convert into actual revenue.



Most companies tend to prioritize creating their content in this order:



Top-of-funnel topics → Middle-of-funnel topics → Bottom-of-funnel topics



We think it’s more effective to do the opposite:
Bottom-of-funnel topics → Middle-of-funnel topics → Top-of-funnel topics
Attack bottom-of-funnel topics first. Doing so enables you to serve prospects who are already searching for a solution to the problem you solve.
Bottom of the funnel content attracts audiences that are actively looking to purchase a product like yours to solve their problem. This means they’re much more likely to convert than a prospect that is just learning about their pain point.
The buyer awareness matrix is a diagram we created to illustrate the types of content that fit each level of a prospect’s problem/solution awareness level.
We use it to prioritize the type of content we create. So we begin by targeting content in the product aware stage (comparison pages, case studies, use case pages, etc.) as they are most likely to convert. Then we move up the funnel to solution aware content (calculators, buying guides, etc.) and then problem aware and finally unaware.

Below we’ll discuss the different types of content at each stage of the buyer awareness journey in more detail.



Bottom-of-Funnel Content



Bottom-of-funnel topics may show little to no search volume, but have much higher conversion rates. Examples of good BOFU content include:




Comparison pages demonstrating how your software stacks up against your competitors.
Alternative to pages inserting themselves into the conversation of other options your competitors’ customers might consider.
Product pages describing the category of the product you deliver or the solution that your target prospect might search for.
Use cases covering specific actions your ideal customers take while using your product.
Case studies demonstrating the results you’ve helped other customers achieve. Prospects who read case studies are at a point where they have genuine interest in your offer, but need assurance before they buy.




Middle-of-Funnel Content



Middle-of-funnel content, on the other hand, has medium search volume and medium conversion rates. The most common kinds of MOFU content are:




Interactive tools giving prospects a preview of what you offer without requiring a full commitment to a trial or demo. Some examples are questionnaires or calculators.
Marketing intelligence pieces establishing the business case for your SaaS product. They provide prospects with the information they need to get decision-makers to sign off on purchasing your product.
Product tour pages similar to proxies for demos and best for companies that offer more than one product.




Top-of-Funnel Content



Finally, top-of-funnel content focuses on keywords with the highest search volume, but lowest buying intent. These pages and blog posts often land the lowest number conversions. Examples include:




Expanded list posts and expert roundups, which are great for prospects first learning about the problem you solve.
Ultimate guides about certain topics that connect to the core use cases of your product.
‘How to’ narrative content that explains how to do something in the context of your product’s features.
Opinion and thought leadership pieces that grab the attention of your target audience by expressing a contrarian perspective. One side of readers will share these pieces because they agree with you, while the other will engage with them because they disagree.




Creating Effective Content Upgrades for Lead Generation



Many companies struggle to create quality content upgrades that their visitors actually want. Weak lead magnet offerings include:




Newsletters, which are often too general and not interesting enough.
Webinar recordings, which many people perceive to be either boring or too long.
White papers, which often come across dry and not useful.




Effective lead magnets have four qualities. They’re simple, actionable, goal oriented, and easy to consume. For example, a list of common mistakes your users make before they buy your product can help your prospects understand what they’re doing wrong and what needs to be fixed.
Essentially, a lead magnet is just a low tech form that shows how your SaaS solves a particular pain point and a problem. So it could be an Excel sheet or calculator that solves some pain point your audience faces.
Often, it’s a precursor to a more powerful feature that your product offers.
Nurturing with Lifecycle Emails
Once you have the prospect’s email, you have to engage them to continue moving them further through the customer journey. Otherwise, they’ll disengage and likely leave for a competitors’ product.
The most effective method we’ve found to engage prospects is to send lifecycle emails.
For example, here’s what a lifecycle email sequence looks like for a trial-led B2B SaaS:

Email 1: Personal Welcome Email From Your Founder
Email 2: Proactive Support Email
Email 3, 4, & 5: New Lead Sequence
Email 6A: Unconverted Trial Email
Email 6B: (Converted Customer): Converted Trial Email

This form of nurturing is highly effective as it’s personal (it goes directly to their inbox) and all of these prospects have already raised their hand and shown interest in your product. You can also segment your list to send them appropriate content depending on the lead magnet they selected.
As an added bonus, it’s relatively low tech and costs next to nothing (just the email marketing software and the copywriter to write the initial sequence).
However, your existing prospects aren’t your only opportunity for increasing revenue.
As we discuss in our B2B SaaS re-acceleration strategies, you can also nurture existing customers by showing them how to use the product more effectively so that you can increase their LTV. You can also send them occasional upsells to further increase their LTV.
Lost prospects and even churned customers are also great outreach opportunities.
Many of them churn simply because they didn’t need the product at that time or their budgets were cut. If you reach out to them at the right time, they may come back and sign up for your product again.
Forecasting & Reporting
Once you have a strategy in place, it can be tricky figuring out how to set realistic goals, and determine the quantity of resources you’ll need to execute your strategy.
Specifically, you’ll have to answer questions like:

What goals you plan to accomplish
The timeline
The budget required
Channels you’ll leverage based on current pipeline metrics

To answer these questions, we build out detailed marketing forecasts.
Specifically, we model out several different scenarios (do nothing, conservative, realistic, optimistic) that show where you’ll land depending on the strategic decisions you make.
You can use our B2B SaaS marketing funnel forecasting template to model out various scenarios for your own company.
This data also gives you the data you need to accurately estimate what you can achieve with the allotted time and resources and therefore win the budget you need from stakeholders if there isn’t any reliable data to show that the strategy you’ve established can produce the predicted results.



Take The Next Step To Build A Demand Generation Flywheel



Building a demand generation flywheel for your SaaS business isn’t easy — but it’s necessary if your company is struggling to continuously generate qualified leads. Once it starts spinning, the system can be leveraged over the long term for continuous results.



Remember to always place the customer at the core of your flywheel-building process. Think about how you can address their problems through the blog posts you write, pages you create, and lead magnets they can download.



Use all the tools we’ve covered in this article to not only communicate the value of your SaaS product, but to also foster a connection with prospects. When you do, you can convince them to know, like, and trust your company as a solution to their struggles.

        Summarize with ChatGPT    

    
    

						
During a recent conversation, a SaaS CEO was explaining to us that he’d just hired a new head of content, and the new hire wanted to create some white papers (a common type of lead magnet in B2B SaaS).
The CEO said to us, “You mentioned that white papers are not that useful. How should we think about what pieces of content to create — and in what order?”
His desire to approach creating content strategically — paired with lacking a framework to think through how to do this — is a problem we’ve seen come up a lot for the SaaS businesses we work with.
Since they’d expressed that they’re trying to be a category creating company (i.e. a type of product that doesn’t yet exist in the market), we explained that much of their target audience would be completely unaware of the problem their product solves — and therefore unlikely to be actively looking for a solution.
At Powered By Search, we refer to this audience as an audience who is problem unaware. And when you’re in this SaaS company’s position, where much of your audience is problem unaware, it’s useful to begin with creating content that helps them become problem aware.
When we explained this, he said, “That sounds theoretically good, but I’m still not sure what kind of content works for that.”
At that point, we walked him through the types of content that we’ve found to work for SaaS audiences at four different levels of awareness:

Problem Unaware: Audiences who aren’t aware they even have the problem your product solves.
Problem Aware: Audiences who know they have a problem but aren’t yet aware of solutions.
Solution Aware: Audiences who are problem aware and also know there are solutions that exist (and may be actively looking for one).
Product Aware: Audiences who are problem and solution aware, and who are also aware of your product as a solution (potentially wanting to evaluate it).

Below, we break down our Buyer Awareness Matrix that maps out the content types we’ve found work well in each of these stages. Then, we describe how SaaS companies can think about using it based on their market type. Finally, we wrap up with our recommendations for putting this tool to actual use.
Our philosophy on content is that it’s not about quantity — it’s about offering the right types of content at the right times to guide audiences through the buyer’s journey. If you’re a B2B SaaS business that would like to learn about how we can help you with this, schedule a Free SaaS Scale Session here.
The Buyer Awareness Matrix, Explained

This simple grid represents the four different levels of audience awareness that we described above, each with a list of content types to create for audiences at that level.
The function of content in each category is to help move audiences to the next level of awareness. And commercial or purchase intent increases as audiences move from unaware to problem aware, to solution aware, and eventually to product aware.
Note: Moving through the various levels of awareness is the equivalent of moving down the funnel. So you can think of content in the problem-unaware quadrant as top-of-funnel content and content in the product-aware quadrant as bottom-of-the-funnel content.
The following content types are what we’ve found to work best at each level:

Problem Unaware Content: Books, Quizzes, Symptom-Focused Articles, Press Articles, Category Consumption (content that goes through the why, what, how, and what to do next regarding your product category)
Problem Aware Content: Checklists, Webinars, Guides, Templates
Solution Aware Content: Calculators, Buying Guides, Industry Reports, Product Choice Quizzes, Scorecards
Product Aware Content: Case Studies, Comparison Pages, Use Case Pages, ROI Calculators

Fundamentally, some of these content types are foundational elements of any well-designed SaaS website. For example, use case pages are typically built into the architecture of a site. And case studies are also typically present, as it’s well understood that they’re necessary for demonstrating value to prospects.
Beyond these, there is a lot of flexibility in which types of content you choose to create from the matrix.
An ideal mix for any SaaS company should include (at minimum) something from each category. That way you have at least some content asset that can guide any ideal prospect to the next step in the journey (regardless of their initial level of awareness or purchase intent).
When it comes to which types of content a given company should choose and in which order, it’s useful to take into account the market you’re in.
Creating Content Strategically Based on Your Market
What follows is our recommended approach to content creation for companies in three common scenarios:

Creating content for established markets.
Creating content for new markets (category creating products).
Creating content when a company wants to move upmarket.

Creating Content for Established Markets
In established markets, much of your target audience will be problem or solution aware, and helping them become product aware (aware of your product as a solution) takes higher priority.
For example, if you make accounting software, there is less need to focus on educating people about the problems it solves, because it’s widely known that using accounting software is a fundamental necessity for doing business. There is more need to focus on showing up in search results when people are actively looking for and weighing solutions — so content like case studies, use case pages, and competitor comparison pages should be created first.
Our article on B2B SaaS content strategy describes our approach to content creation for companies in established markets, beginning with bottom-of-the-funnel (BOTF) content for people in the solution and product aware stages, and exhausting those options before moving up to mid- and top-of-funnel content (equivalent to the content types listed in the Problem Unaware and Problem Aware sections of the matrix).

However, if your SaaS is a category creating product, a reordering of this approach is a better fit.
Creating Content for New Markets (Category Creating Products)
When you’re in a position like the SaaS CEO we discussed above, where you’re creating a new category of product all together, it’s likely that much of your target audience is unaware they have a problem, and therefore unlikely to be seeking a solution.
In this case, creating problem unaware content (top of funnel content to educate consumers about the problem your product solves) takes the highest priority in the beginning. So companies in this situation should start with creating at least one or two content assets in that category.
We typically lean towards creating symptoms-focused articles or quizzes at this stage. For example, take this lead magnet we created for our previous client Restaurant Systems Pro:

 
This was a downloadable PDF lead magnet we created for the problem-unaware folks in their audience. It’s pain-point focused and designed to help restaurant owners and managers self-diagnose the problems they experience around managing food costs — the specific problems their product helps to solve.
Then, once your problem unaware content is created, we recommend moving back up to the product aware (BOTF) content you’ll need to close customers (e.g. case studies). Lastly, you’d move to create mid-funnel content (the types listed in the problem- and solution-aware categories).
Creating Content When You’re Moving Upmarket
Another common situation we see is when SaaS companies are seeking to move upmarket to serve more enterprise clients. And the challenge is that, even for the enterprise companies who are problem or solution aware, they aren’t yet aware of your product as a potential solution.
In addition, since they’ve typically been serving smaller or medium-sized companies, they may not have enterprise case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their product for companies of that size.
In this case, our recommended approach would be to start with either problem- or solution-aware (mid-funnel) content, with the objective of moving enterprise prospects to become product aware. Then, as you acquire your first enterprise customers, you can begin to build out better BOTF content such as case studies; similar to the approach with established markets, top-of-funnel (problem-unaware) content would come last.
Synthesis: Recommendations for Using the Matrix In Practice
Here’s a simple way you can use this matrix:

Take stock of the content assets you have, and note them down in the corresponding sections of the matrix (using a darker color to indicate it’s something you already have).
Fill out the other content types in a lighter color (indicating the content assets you don’t yet have).
Consider your market type and position when choosing in which order to update previously created content or create new content.
Go forth and update your previous content (unless the quality is already very high) or create new content.

In general, whenever you can update previously created content, lean into that as opposed to creating content from scratch. That will require less effort and be the most efficient option if you happen to have some of these assets already.
From there, deploy the content through the marketing channels where you’ve found customer-channel fit, and leverage omnichannel remarketing to drive right-fit prospects to your content and lead them down the funnel.
Conclusion
In following this process of using the Buyer Awareness Matrix, you can increase the likelihood of delivering content to your audience that will actually fit their stage in the buyer’s journey — and therefore be more likely to guide them to the next desired stage. At the same time, you can decrease the likelihood of delivering content to the right people, but in the wrong way at the wrong time.

						The Buyer Awareness Matrix: A Content Strategy Tool for B2B SaaS

        Summarize with ChatGPT    

    
    

						
During a recent conversation, a SaaS CEO was explaining to us that he’d just hired a new head of content, and the new hire wanted to create some white papers (a common type of lead magnet in B2B SaaS).
The CEO said to us, “You mentioned that white papers are not that useful. How should we think about what pieces of content to create — and in what order?”
His desire to approach creating content strategically — paired with lacking a framework to think through how to do this — is a problem we’ve seen come up a lot for the SaaS businesses we work with.
Since they’d expressed that they’re trying to be a category creating company (i.e. a type of product that doesn’t yet exist in the market), we explained that much of their target audience would be completely unaware of the problem their product solves — and therefore unlikely to be actively looking for a solution.
At Powered By Search, we refer to this audience as an audience who is problem unaware. And when you’re in this SaaS company’s position, where much of your audience is problem unaware, it’s useful to begin with creating content that helps them become problem aware.
When we explained this, he said, “That sounds theoretically good, but I’m still not sure what kind of content works for that.”
At that point, we walked him through the types of content that we’ve found to work for SaaS audiences at four different levels of awareness:

Problem Unaware: Audiences who aren’t aware they even have the problem your product solves.
Problem Aware: Audiences who know they have a problem but aren’t yet aware of solutions.
Solution Aware: Audiences who are problem aware and also know there are solutions that exist (and may be actively looking for one).
Product Aware: Audiences who are problem and solution aware, and who are also aware of your product as a solution (potentially wanting to evaluate it).

Below, we break down our Buyer Awareness Matrix that maps out the content types we’ve found work well in each of these stages. Then, we describe how SaaS companies can think about using it based on their market type. Finally, we wrap up with our recommendations for putting this tool to actual use.
Our philosophy on content is that it’s not about quantity — it’s about offering the right types of content at the right times to guide audiences through the buyer’s journey. If you’re a B2B SaaS business that would like to learn about how we can help you with this, schedule a Free SaaS Scale Session here.
The Buyer Awareness Matrix, Explained

This simple grid represents the four different levels of audience awareness that we described above, each with a list of content types to create for audiences at that level.
The function of content in each category is to help move audiences to the next level of awareness. And commercial or purchase intent increases as audiences move from unaware to problem aware, to solution aware, and eventually to product aware.
Note: Moving through the various levels of awareness is the equivalent of moving down the funnel. So you can think of content in the problem-unaware quadrant as top-of-funnel content and content in the product-aware quadrant as bottom-of-the-funnel content.
The following content types are what we’ve found to work best at each level:

Problem Unaware Content: Books, Quizzes, Symptom-Focused Articles, Press Articles, Category Consumption (content that goes through the why, what, how, and what to do next regarding your product category)
Problem Aware Content: Checklists, Webinars, Guides, Templates
Solution Aware Content: Calculators, Buying Guides, Industry Reports, Product Choice Quizzes, Scorecards
Product Aware Content: Case Studies, Comparison Pages, Use Case Pages, ROI Calculators

Fundamentally, some of these content types are foundational elements of any well-designed SaaS website. For example, use case pages are typically built into the architecture of a site. And case studies are also typically present, as it’s well understood that they’re necessary for demonstrating value to prospects.
Beyond these, there is a lot of flexibility in which types of content you choose to create from the matrix.
An ideal mix for any SaaS company should include (at minimum) something from each category. That way you have at least some content asset that can guide any ideal prospect to the next step in the journey (regardless of their initial level of awareness or purchase intent).
When it comes to which types of content a given company should choose and in which order, it’s useful to take into account the market you’re in.
Creating Content Strategically Based on Your Market
What follows is our recommended approach to content creation for companies in three common scenarios:

Creating content for established markets.
Creating content for new markets (category creating products).
Creating content when a company wants to move upmarket.

Creating Content for Established Markets
In established markets, much of your target audience will be problem or solution aware, and helping them become product aware (aware of your product as a solution) takes higher priority.
For example, if you make accounting software, there is less need to focus on educating people about the problems it solves, because it’s widely known that using accounting software is a fundamental necessity for doing business. There is more need to focus on showing up in search results when people are actively looking for and weighing solutions — so content like case studies, use case pages, and competitor comparison pages should be created first.
Our article on B2B SaaS content strategy describes our approach to content creation for companies in established markets, beginning with bottom-of-the-funnel (BOTF) content for people in the solution and product aware stages, and exhausting those options before moving up to mid- and top-of-funnel content (equivalent to the content types listed in the Problem Unaware and Problem Aware sections of the matrix).

However, if your SaaS is a category creating product, a reordering of this approach is a better fit.
Creating Content for New Markets (Category Creating Products)
When you’re in a position like the SaaS CEO we discussed above, where you’re creating a new category of product all together, it’s likely that much of your target audience is unaware they have a problem, and therefore unlikely to be seeking a solution.
In this case, creating problem unaware content (top of funnel content to educate consumers about the problem your product solves) takes the highest priority in the beginning. So companies in this situation should start with creating at least one or two content assets in that category.
We typically lean towards creating symptoms-focused articles or quizzes at this stage. For example, take this lead magnet we created for our previous client Restaurant Systems Pro:

 
This was a downloadable PDF lead magnet we created for the problem-unaware folks in their audience. It’s pain-point focused and designed to help restaurant owners and managers self-diagnose the problems they experience around managing food costs — the specific problems their product helps to solve.
Then, once your problem unaware content is created, we recommend moving back up to the product aware (BOTF) content you’ll need to close customers (e.g. case studies). Lastly, you’d move to create mid-funnel content (the types listed in the problem- and solution-aware categories).
Creating Content When You’re Moving Upmarket
Another common situation we see is when SaaS companies are seeking to move upmarket to serve more enterprise clients. And the challenge is that, even for the enterprise companies who are problem or solution aware, they aren’t yet aware of your product as a potential solution.
In addition, since they’ve typically been serving smaller or medium-sized companies, they may not have enterprise case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of their product for companies of that size.
In this case, our recommended approach would be to start with either problem- or solution-aware (mid-funnel) content, with the objective of moving enterprise prospects to become product aware. Then, as you acquire your first enterprise customers, you can begin to build out better BOTF content such as case studies; similar to the approach with established markets, top-of-funnel (problem-unaware) content would come last.

		Strategic SaaS web design agencySaaS companies who are investing in their marketing often get to a point where the traffic to their website is going up but the number of trials and demos is not growing at the same rate.
There’s a wide variety of causes for this but almost all roads eventually lead back to a common place:
The website isn’t converting because it’s not effectively supporting visitors in making the choice to click ‘book demo’ or ‘start trial’.
That’s why so many B2B SaaS companies hire us to help them get growth back on track with a strategic website design project
SaaS website design is more than visual
Typically, SaaS websites redesign projects are focused around making sure the visuals are great and that all the right buttons are in the right place.
Of course: your website should look best in class. That’s obvious.
The problem that most SaaS companies run into is that while the website might look great, load fast and run on the perfect CMS for their company, they end up moving all the wrong metrics:
Wrong: Page speed
Right: Improved ranking in organic search
Wrong: Positive feedback from C-suite
Right: Increase in visitors converting to trial or demo
Wrong: Industry recognition for having a beautiful website
Right: Net new customers who recognize your product is right for them
How do you get the things marked as right?
You hire an agency who knows that the real wins in SaaS website design or redesign projects are in the following areas:

Strategic messaging
Site architecture that supports the customer journey
Building buyer awareness on every page

How Powered by Search approaches SaaS web design differently to other agencies
Powered by Search is widely considered to be one of the world’s leading SaaS marketing agencies.
One of the core reasons that we’re able to maintain and build on that perception is that we consistently deliver results. We do that by approaching every project differently. 
For example, here’s how we run SaaS website design projects:

Messaging-first design — We write the copy collaboratively with the client before wireframing
Information Architecture development – We map out the customer journey and how to support that with the website
Collaborative Work in Progress — No big reveal. Clients work with us as we go so that no-one is sideswiped on ‘presentation day’

Messaging-first design
By starting with messaging, we make sure that the biggest win of all is taken care of. Your ideal customer should load the website and say, no matter where they are in the customer journey:
‘Yes. This could be what I need. I want to find out more.’
Check out this example from our client FieldInsight. Before we started working with them, their website wasn’t connecting effectively to their ideal customer:

But after we gained a deep understanding of their ideal customer’s wants, needs, fears and aspirations as well as diving into why FieldInsight was uniquely placed to solve their problems, we were able to redesign their messaging (and the visuals!).
Here’s what it looked like at the end of the project:

Information Architecture development
The second part to our process for SaaS web design is to collaborate on the information architecture of our client’s sites in a lo-fi wireframe.
Doing this allows us to understand:
If all of the visual flair on this site was redesigned, would it still be an attractive proposition for the ideal customer?
Take our client Truffle POS for example. Here’s what their site looked like before we started this process:

When our messaging phase was complete, we had a directional messaging strategy but needed to work with our client to make sure that it would meet their customers’ needs too.
So we moved into a lo-fi wireframe like this one to refine and adapt:

With the bare minimum visual design, we can truly see whether the messaging strategy is effective in communicating the differentiated positioning.
After iterating on the lo-fi wireframe, we moved to a visual design phase where the end result looked like this:

A huge visual and strategic improvement!
Collaborative Work in Progress
Many of our clients come to us expecting that we’ll deliver results but worried that they might invest their budget into our process and not see a final result until all the development budget has been spent.
Unfortunately, this is because most agencies operate almost entirely without client input.
They spend weeks ‘in a cave’ exercising their Don Draper style brilliance, gather everyone in the client’s organization together into a presentation, give a lofty presentation, pull down a curtain over the design and wait for awes of appreciation and applause.
Only… that doesn’t happen… because they’ve totally failed to understand their client’s customer’s needs.
The result is a sunk cost. They’re too far in to invest more money and end up with a website that just totally underperforms.
This is one of the key reasons that we do this totally differently.
We involve clients in our strategic web design projects from start to finish, making sure that there are no surprises along the way.
We don’t want to demonstrate our design excellence. We want to build a website that connects with your customers.
Nothing else matters.
For example, here’s a to-do list from the website redesign project with our client iWave:

At no point in this project did we take the conversation, workflow, process out of their sight. Instead, we involved them at every point, getting feedback, showing our progress publicly.
That’s the reason that we were able to take them from this:

To a website that really communicates their unique, differentiated positioning in the marketplace:

Get a SaaS website design that connects with your customers
SaaS website redesign projects frequently go off the rails for the following reasons:

There’s a total disconnect between your goals and your agencies – they want flashy, good looking websites to add to their portfolio, you want customers to use your product because the messaging convinces them to find out more
There’s no strategy for working out whether the message is strong enough without design – marketing agencies tend to build hi-fi wireframes in products that your team doesn’t use and deliver them after it’s too late to make changes
There’s no collaboration throughout the project – most agencies want to show off their genius with big reveals. This is a horrific experience for clients

If you want to avoid those common pitfalls, you should reach out about working together because we:

Focus on developing messaging that connects with your ICP’s needs, wants, fears and desires first and foremost
Apply that directly to lo-fi wireframes and collaborate with you on making sure the information architecture is right for your ideal customer
Keep you involved in the process the whole way – we have zero ego and hate big reveals. We just want to get you a website that converts visitors into customers

If that sounds like a good fit for you, schedule a free SaaS Scale session where we’ll brainstorm some scaling ideas for you, and pinpoint bottlenecks in your demo and trial acquisition and conversion process.

						When you’re trying to solve a problem, it can be difficult to know where to start, and it’s very easy to feel overwhelmed. This is the same whether you’re trying to solve it yourself, or trying to use a tool to solve it for you.
This is why templates can be so useful, as they give you somewhere to start and is why so many SaaS companies offer templates as part of their SaaS product. Zapier, for example, provides hundreds of free templates that users can use as soon as they’ve signed up.
What’s less common is offering standalone templates as a precursor to the buying process that can demonstrate some of the benefits of the software without requiring any commitment.
These templates might be provided as forms, documents, or spreadsheets, but they all mirror the functionality of your SaaS product and offer a viable, yet lo-fi solution.
In this article, we’ll look at:

Why offering standalone templates is such a valuable play for SaaS companies
How to build a library of standalone templates that helps move buyers through the customer journey
The common pitfalls most SaaS companies face when creating these templates

After reading this post, you’ll have a clear idea of what precursor marketing is, and how you can use templates earlier in your selling process to engage and acquire more customers.

What is precursor marketing?
Many SaaS companies take a haphazard approach when trying to identify the steps that lead to action. They look at the journey a customer takes in a simplistic and linear way:

 
Based on this model, it would be easy to assume that the pricing page was a necessary precursor to signing up. This assumption would lead you to waste time and money in an area that might not need it.
We buy things based on what we’re trying to achieve, not how much they cost.
If you walk into a supermarket to buy a sandwich, you’re not going to buy a pencil sharpener instead just because it was cheaper.
The price of something is inevitably part of the buying process, but it’s rarely the driving force behind the decision.
How other industries use precursor marketing
To get an idea of what a better approach could be, we can look at other industries to see how they encourage and entice people to buy.

Hollywood – Movie production companies release teasers and trailers of their movies, which allows the consumer to experience a small sample of what the movie will be.
Supermarkets – Food vendors offer free samples of their food and drink products so the customer will know immediately whether or not they like the product.

These are both simple ways to give the customer a chance to experience the benefits of the final product without giving away the whole thing for free.
More importantly, if the customer didn’t know your product existed in the first place, they do now, and they can use this new information to make buying decisions.
This is what we’re talking about when we say precursor marketing — it’s the things you can do as a SaaS company to make yourselves known to your customers, while also giving them a taste of what you can do for them.
How we can apply this to SaaS Marketing
We already have demo videos and free trials for SaaS products, but these are effective once the customer is solution-aware and already in the process of choosing what tool to use.
If your customer is only problem-aware, they won’t even know your product exists, so there’s no reason for them to watch your videos or sign up for your free trial.
Instead, you need to find a way to let potential customers experience the benefits of your SaaS without requiring them to watch any videos or use your product.
Most SaaS products offer one or more of the following benefits — speed, certainty, and insight — so you need to find a way to deliver those same benefits to your customers earlier in the sales process.

Why is precursor marketing different to engineering as marketing?
Precursor marketing shares a lot of key benefits with engineering as marketing — where SaaS companies create a free tool that solves a customer’s problem in a way that’s linked to their main offering.
The main difference is that engineering as marketing tends to solve an adjacent problem, rather than the same problem their software solves. This is often in the form of things like calculators, checkers, or widgets.
This approach works in the company’s favor in two ways:

Gives the customer immediate value, putting the company in a good position to convince the customer that the company can provide even more value if they sign up for the software itself.
Utilizes the reciprocity principle that tells us that customers are more likely to view us favorably after we’ve given them something or done them a favor.

Both of these benefits are great, but unfortunately, engineering as marketing isn’t always a viable option because it requires development effort.
Not only does this make engineering as marketing expensive (developer time can cost a lot of money), but it can also prove difficult to get this work prioritized over the existing backlog of work.
Templates are a much simpler solution
A much simpler, and cheaper approach to precursor marketing is providing free document templates that solve a problem your software already solves, albeit in a less comprehensive way.
These precursor documents should replicate part of your software’s functionality, but in a lo-fi way such as in a spreadsheet, document, or checklist.
These templates help the customer with their problem, while also introducing them to your solution.
If you analyze search terms, you can see that there is a comparable number of people searching for x software, as there are people searching for x template.
People are looking for a solution to their problem — you just need to direct them toward yours.

Client example: Loopio’s go/no-go decision template
Our client Loopio uses this technique beautifully by offering a PDF template to help teams make Go/No-Go decisions for RFPs. They offer a simple, free template that anyone can download and use.

The template isn’t especially complicated — it just has some data, a few editable fields, and some instructions on how to use it — but it’s still a step up from having no help with this process.
Once the customer has submitted the form, they receive a useful template, and Loopio gains a qualified lead that they know would benefit from their SaaS.

How to create your first precursor template
Using tools such as Google Sheets or PDF builders, you can easily create basic, but useful templates that help your customers address their pain points.
Because this doesn’t require any coding skills, the marketing team can create the templates, and you can tweak and adapt them to help with different problems your customers are trying to solve.
Step 1: Decide what problem you’re going to solve?
It’s a good idea to watch product tours and demo videos to get an idea of the functionality the sales team is prioritizing and shouting about on the onboarding sequence.
Then, you should do a quick check on Google to make sure you aren’t already offering a template that addresses this problem.

If there isn’t a template already, talk to the product team about the features and what pain points those features solve for the customer.
They will likely have documentation/research data that will make it easier to define your templates.
Step 2: Create the template
The easiest way to start developing the template is to jump on a call with someone from the product team that knows a lot about the feature you’re basing your template on.
When you’re on this call, ask them what the functionality would look like if it was built in a spreadsheet (or another type of template). Then, either sketch it out or start building the document itself.
You can continuously iterate the template, making changes and improvements based on the feedback of the product team. This doesn’t need to be a long process.
Step 3: Launch the template
You want to launch your template as soon as you can, so you can start reaping the benefits sooner.
It’s not as simple as just sticking it on your website and hoping for the best, though.
There are three things you’ll want to have in place before launching your precursor template: a landing page, a thank you page, and an email sequence.
Landing page
The landing page offers several opportunities to connect with your audience:

It will be the page that shows up on search results and brings your potential customers onto your site
The name of the page should resonate with the reader and directly address a pain point your customers experience
The page can explain what the template is, how to use it, and clarify what problem it solves
It will display the form a user will fill in to access the template — you want to capture at least their email address

Thank you page
Once a customer has filled in and submitted the form, you could just say “thanks” and leave it at that. But that would be a missed opportunity.
Instead, it’s important to have a lead magnet thank you page where you can utilize videos, testimonials, conversion copy, and so on to highlight why they should be using your SaaS.
Email sequence
Once they’ve received their template, you’ll want to follow up by email to prompt them to use the template and remind them that your software would provide an even better solution.
There are two key emails you’ll need in your email sequence:

Short, simple email: A simple email sent one day after they download the template, asking something like, “Were you able to access the template?” This simply reminds them that they intended to use the template
Follow-up: This is sent a few days later, inquiring how they got on with the template and asking if they found it useful. If they reply that they haven’t used it, your automated reply should empathize with this and explain that a lot of people struggle to find the time; then, frame your SaaS as a more practical solution

Make sure your emails are coming from a real person, not a no-reply email address, so your customers know there is genuine value in responding. These emails will be invaluable in bridging the gap between the precursor template and your SaaS.
If you want to add a bit of extra incentive, you can include a special offer in your follow-up email, maybe with a limited timescale.
This can be an effective way of turning an unsure customer into a customer that is willing to give you a chance.
Once all of these are done, you’re ready to launch!

Client Example — How Titan GPS uses a free guide to target leads who aren’t ready to buy

You can see from this screenshot of Titan GPS’s landing page how we used this technique (in the form of a free guide) to boost their number of qualified leads.
The landing page is clear about what it’s offering and makes it easy to fill in the form and receive the guide.
This free guide gave Titan GPS a total of 300 MQLs (marketing qualified leads) over a five-month period, which highlights the value of precursor marketing.

Common mistakes with precursor marketing
Precursor templates can be a big opportunity to acquire more leads and draw attention to your SaaS earlier in the funnel, but it’s not without pitfalls.
Here are a few common mistakes we’ve seen when people try to implement precursor marketing techniques:
Focusing too much on high volume keywords
A common mistake when deciding which templates to build is focusing too much on keyword research.
Keyword-driven templates may be an easy way to gather lots of email addresses, but if the template doesn’t solve the same problems your software tackles, there will be minimal buying intent and you won’t be able to convert subscribers into customers.
Waiting for perfection before shipping
It’s easy to get bogged down trying to make your template look amazing, but your template doesn’t need to be flawlessly branded and formatted.
Focus instead on making it functional and getting the name right. Having a name that nails the pain point will be far more effective than making sure the columns are using the right brand colors.
Quantity over quality
Another pitfall some companies fall into is focusing on creating as many templates as possible.
This will only provide diminishing returns, whereas focusing on key pain points will yield more effective results.
Not following up
If you don’t follow up on these leads, the templates won’t accomplish much.
Remember, the reason templates are so useful is that anyone who downloads them would benefit from using your product.
Make sure you’re sending them follow-ups and even timed special offers to encourage them to give your product a go.
In closing
Pre-cursor marketing is the perfect way to identify problem-aware customers and convert them into solution-aware customers.
It doesn’t matter whether the customer uses the template; the important part is that you’re collecting names of people who could genuinely benefit from using your software.
Templates only work if they closely resemble what the software does, but if they do, you’ll get a steady stream of qualified leads, primed and ready to be sold to.

						When you’re trying to solve a problem, it can be difficult to know where to start, and it’s very easy to feel overwhelmed. This is the same whether you’re trying to solve it yourself, or trying to use a tool to solve it for you.
This is why templates can be so useful, as they give you somewhere to start and is why so many SaaS companies offer templates as part of their SaaS product. Zapier, for example, provides hundreds of free templates that users can use as soon as they’ve signed up.
What’s less common is offering standalone templates as a precursor to the buying process that can demonstrate some of the benefits of the software without requiring any commitment.
These templates might be provided as forms, documents, or spreadsheets, but they all mirror the functionality of your SaaS product and offer a viable, yet lo-fi solution.
In this article, we’ll look at:

Why offering standalone templates is such a valuable play for SaaS companies
How to build a library of standalone templates that helps move buyers through the customer journey

						“What’s the difference, in terms of deliverables, ROI, and expectations, between a marketing consultant and a marketing agency?”
This is a question we often receive from prospects considering third party help, as the definition between the two is often unclear.   
Many B2B SaaS marketers are currently facing layoffs and budget constraints. This makes consulting solutions much more attractive, as that service comes with a lower price point and requires less upfront commitment and risk than an agency service. 
For some prospects, a consulting agreement is a better option than hiring an agency.  
Neither service is definitively better than the other, and the best option for you really depends on your company’s available resources, team, and goals. 
To help you make a more informed decision, this post will:

Debunk some of the myths about working with agencies and consultants
Compare and contrast agencies and consultants to explain their key differences and expectations for both services.

Lay out specific use cases where it makes sense to hire either a marketing consultant or an agency
3 Misconceptions We’ve Seen in the Agency vs. Consultant Decision
The misconceptions we typically see around hiring outside marketing resources are typically related to the attention you’ll receive, who actually does the work you need done, and credentials.

1. “One Option Will Offer Us More Attention Than the Other”
There is often this idea that a consultant will be able to offer you more of their time because they have fewer clients. In some cases, it may be true, but while a consultant typically has fewer clients, they also are just one person. And one person with multiple clients won’t necessarily be able to offer you more of their attention. So in our minds, this is a wash. One option has a single person but handles fewer clients, the other has a team, but handles more.
The attention you’ll receive is really just a function of whether either is oversubscribed in clients relative to what they can handle and that’s hard to tell a priori. Talking to their previous clients is likely the best way to validate this.
2. “Who We Hire Will Be the Only One Doing the Work”
This misconception comes in two flavors. First, companies sometimes think that hiring a consultant means the expert you hire (the one that’s earned your trust) is the individual who will do all of the work that’s planned. That may be true in some cases, but from what we’ve seen consultants are not averse to working with other contractors on projects. Often the best consultants will work with other 3rd party contractors. So if you’re talking to a potential consultant, ask. Ask in detail who will be doing what work.
And companies make similar assumptions about agencies. They’ll think, because agencies have teams in-house, they also have the capacity to complete your entire project in-house. But the reality is that many agencies still outsource certain elements of client work. For example, if you hire an advertising agency to run your paid search and social ads, they might outsource the copywriting to a freelancer while they develop strategy, architect the actual campaigns, and execute on them.
There is nothing inherently wrong with your outside marketing resource working with contractors to get the work done, but it’s common for both agencies and consultants to do this and it’s worth bringing up in conversations with the options you consider hiring.
3. “Because They Worked at a Hot SaaS Company or They Reached Agency Level, They Must Be Capable of Delivering Results”
This is a more subtle but potentially dangerous misconception. SaaS companies sometimes assume that if a consultant has a track record of working for other high-profile companies, they’ll be highly capable of getting results for their company too.
But depending on what specifically you’re hiring them to do, their skill set may or may not be a match. To suss this out, it’s useful to ask them about what specifically they were doing at those companies while they worked there.
For example, if you’re hiring them for their overall demand generation results, what did they do? Did they produce the content? Did they run the ads? Who made the creative? Who did keyword research? Who optimized the social demographic targeting? These details matter when hiring a consultant for marketing services.
This same misconception applies to agencies. Here, you’re typically safer with knowing what they did because agencies are clearer on what they do versus what clients or others do. But be careful to ask the same questions about exactly who did what piece.
Dig into the details of campaigns, ask about every step. In addition to figuring out who did what, you’ll also be able to gauge their own ability to clearly articulate what they did and why. If you’re unhappy with that, it means you’ll likely be unhappy with their explanations behind their choices when you’re their client, too.
The Key Differences Between Agencies and Consultants

We see three core buckets of needs that SaaS business owners and CMO’s look to fill when they’re hiring an agency or consultant:

Strategy: What should we do?
Planning: Who does what and when?
Execution: Getting the actual work done.

The key high-level difference to understand between agencies and consultants is that typically an agency can facilitate all three needs while a consultant will specialize in one or two. Most good consultants would tell you that they do a few things really well but they don’t do everything.
If you do hire a consultant for all three needs, that’s when they have to begin acting like an agency without an agency’s resources — organizing a team (often one they’re not used to working with) to get the job done. Alternatively, if an agency is at full capacity or they have a knowledge gap, they’d organize a team of consultants or contractors.
Otherwise, the job will typically get done by in-house agency employees who are used to working with each other. Don’t discount the efficiency of the team having worked together before. This typically means fewer communication breakdowns and slowdowns.
Out of the 3 core needs, consultants and agencies probably overlap the most on strategy and planning. There are consultants out there whose services are execution rather than strategy, but sometimes we might think of these individuals more as implementers rather than strategists.
The bottom line is if you’re in a situation where you need one or two of the core needs, consultants can often be a great way to go. If you’re looking for everything from strategy through to execution, an agency will likely be best.
Let’s look at some specific scenarios to explain this further.
In What Specific Cases Should You Choose an Agency or a Consultant?
When You’re Early Stage Trying to Figure Out Product-Market Fit or Target Audiences
For early-stage companies, especially if you’re not funded and trying to figure out product-market fit, working with consultants is a fine choice because your needs aren’t about execution yet. 
You’re just trying to figure out the basis for your digital marketing strategy.
Consultants are great for helping you think through who your target audience is, how to get in front of them, and how to position yourself in the market.
People like April Dunford, Jason Quey, Joel Klettke, Kamil Rextin,  and Mike Sonders are friends of ours and are very good at what they do.
When You Have a Well Aligned Strategy and Plan, But Need Execution
If you have a CMO or marketing manager with strategic expertise that has developed your digital strategy and plan, but don’t yet have a team of individual contributor marketers to execute the work that needs doing, there are two directions you can go. 

Option 1: You can hire a few execution-focused consultants who specialize in the various channels you’ve decided to market through. For example, if you’ve decided to focus on SEO and paid media, you could hire a couple of individuals to do the work for each of those channels. But remember, they’re each only one person and only have so much bandwidth. Both SEO and paid media at scale can take a team to execute well.
Option 2: You can look to a single agency who offers services in both channels and has teams built for execution.

When You Have an In-House Marketing Team Ready to Do the Heavy Lifting, But Need Guidance on Strategy
Companies that have grown over the past several months and have a strong in-house marketing team, but are looking for some external help to identify growth opportunities and improve strategy efficiency could work with an agency or consultant.
A key part of your decision should be based simply on who you think has more strategic expertise. If the primary thing you are looking for is strategic expertise, do not compromise in finding it. 
Be 100% comfortable that the agency or consultant you are hiring is the one you felt could articulate strategy choices the best and had the best mastery of that marketing channel.
However, if the strategy developed involves the need for skills that aren’t a match with your initial marketing hires, a consultant combined with your team may only be able to do a portion of the execution. 
In that case, an agency could be a better option because you’ll need them for execution where your in-house team has knowledge or skill gaps.
Similarly, if you’re operating with a leaner team and the primary intention for hiring a third party is to drive marketing initiatives outside of your current team’s skill set, hiring an agency is a better option than stretching your team thin and paying (in both mistakes and time) for them to learn the skills.
When You Have a Smaller In-House Team But Still Need To Hit Goals
Many marketing teams are currently facing layoffs and still have to hit goals despite operating with a leaner marketing team.
In this case, you likely don’t have the execution resources in-house, meaning hiring an agency is a better option as they can execute the strategy for you.
You also may have to amend the strategy itself to ensure it’s effective with your leaner team.
The only case where a marketing consultant may be a more effective solution is if they can identify and remove inefficiencies in the strategy, allowing your leaner team to deliver the same ROI with fewer resources.
When You Know You’re Looking for Long Term Execution
The longer the time frame is when you’re looking specifically for execution, the more likely it is that an agency will be able to support you. Even if agency staff changes, the core systems, processes, and talent pipeline will be there to make sure that execution continues smoothly.
While there are plenty of consultants who work with clients for years, the nature of working with an individual is that there is a single point of failure. If they ever are unavailable, go on vacation, get sick, or experience anything that is completely unrelated to their capability, things can come to a dead stop. That’s the risk of relying on one person.
Fractional CMO vs Consultant vs Agency
We realize that not every B2B SaaS company needs to work with an agency, yet many marketers we speak with are dissatisfied with the results achieved from working with a marketing consultant.
Specifically, here are a few common challenges:

A single individual’s skills and experiences are limited: Even if the consultant you hire has years of experience, there are a limited number of unique situations they’ve encountered and solved in comparison to an entire team. Similarly, a single person can’t be a specialist across multiple marketing channels.
Advice without action: A marketing consultant’s job is to provide strategic guidance and it’s the team’s responsibility to execute. Yet most teams usually fall short on the execution stage, rendering the entire partnership with the consultant ineffective.

To solve these problems we created a third option – our fractional CMO service.
Our fractional CMO service still resembles a traditional marketing consulting partnership, by focusing on strategic guidance rather than providing a done for you solution. However, it differs from a consulting service in two key ways:

Experience from an entire team: Rather than hiring a single consultant, our fractional CMO offering delivers strategic guidance from each of our team members. For example, if SEO is part of the marketing plan, our SEO specialists can provide a detailed SEO strategy and tactical execution guidance.
Action-oriented strategy with accountability: Most marketing consultants provide goals, but there’s little structured follow-up or accountability. Instead, we operate in two-week springs that are guided by a scorecard with measurable, bi-weekly goals, and we get on biweekly calls to navigate challenges as they arise.

By leveraging the experiences of multiple specialists and holding team members accountable, we’ve found that the fractional CMO option can be a much more effective option for those that don’t need a full service agency, but could benefit from additional strategic guidance and accountability.
What’s The Next Step?
Now that you have a better idea of whether a marketing agency, consultant, or fractional CMO is the best choice for you, the next step is to evaluate various partners to find the best one for your needs.

For example, if you’re hiring them for their overall demand generation results, what did they do? Did they produce the content? Did they run the ads? Who made the creative? Who did keyword research? Who optimized the social demographic targeting? These details matter when hiring a consultant for marketing services.
This same misconception applies to agencies. Here, you’re typically safer with knowing what they did because agencies are clearer on what they do versus what clients or others do. But be careful to ask the same questions about exactly who did what piece.
Dig into the details of campaigns, ask about every step. In addition to figuring out who did what, you’ll also be able to gauge their own ability to clearly articulate what they did and why. If you’re unhappy with that, it means you’ll likely be unhappy with their explanations behind their choices when you’re their client, too.
The Key Differences Between Agencies and Consultants

We see three core buckets of needs that SaaS business owners and CMO’s look to fill when they’re hiring an agency or consultant:

Strategy: What should we do?
Planning: Who does what and when?
Execution: Getting the actual work done.

The key high-level difference to understand between agencies and consultants is that typically an agency can facilitate all three needs while a consultant will specialize in one or two. Most good consultants would tell you that they do a few things really well but they don’t do everything.
If you do hire a consultant for all three needs, that’s when they have to begin acting like an agency without an agency’s resources — organizing a team (often one they’re not used to working with) to get the job done. Alternatively, if an agency is at full capacity or they have a knowledge gap, they’d organize a team of consultants or contractors.
Otherwise, the job will typically get done by in-house agency employees who are used to working with each other. Don’t discount the efficiency of the team having worked together before. This typically means fewer communication breakdowns and slowdowns.
Out of the 3 core needs, consultants and agencies probably overlap the most on strategy and planning. There are consultants out there whose services are execution rather than strategy, but sometimes we might think of these individuals more as implementers rather than strategists.
The bottom line is if you’re in a situation where you need one or two of the core needs, consultants can often be a great way to go. If you’re looking for everything from strategy through to execution, an agency will likely be best.
Let’s look at some specific scenarios to explain this further.
In What Specific Cases Should You Choose an Agency or a Consultant?
When You’re Early Stage Trying to Figure Out Product-Market Fit or Target Audiences
For early-stage companies, especially if you’re not funded and trying to figure out product-market fit, working with consultants is a fine choice because your needs aren’t about execution yet. 
You’re just trying to figure out the basis for your digital marketing strategy.
Consultants are great for helping you think through who your target audience is, how to get in front of them, and how to position yourself in the market.
People like April Dunford, Jason Quey, Joel Klettke, Kamil Rextin,  and Mike Sonders are friends of ours and are very good at what they do.
When You Have a Well Aligned Strategy and Plan, But Need Execution
If you have a CMO or marketing manager with strategic expertise that has developed your digital strategy and plan, but don’t yet have a team of individual contributor marketers to execute the work that needs doing, there are two directions you can go. 

Option 1: You can hire a few execution-focused consultants who specialize in the various channels you’ve decided to market through. For example, if you’ve decided to focus on SEO and paid media, you could hire a couple of individuals to do the work for each of those channels. But remember, they’re each only one person and only have so much bandwidth. Both SEO and paid media at scale can take a team to execute well.
Option 2: You can look to a single agency who offers services in both channels and has teams built for execution.

When You Have an In-House Marketing Team Ready to Do the Heavy Lifting, But Need Guidance on Strategy
Companies that have grown over the past several months and have a strong in-house marketing team, but are looking for some external help to identify growth opportunities and improve strategy efficiency could work with an agency or consultant.
A key part of your decision should be based simply on who you think has more strategic expertise. If the primary thing you are looking for is strategic expertise, do not compromise in finding it. 
Be 100% comfortable that the agency or consultant you are hiring is the one you felt could articulate strategy choices the best and had the best mastery of that marketing channel.
However, if the strategy developed involves the need for skills that aren’t a match with your initial marketing hires, a consultant combined with your team may only be able to do a portion of the execution. 
In that case, an agency could be a better option because you’ll need them for execution where your in-house team has knowledge or skill gaps.
Similarly, if you’re operating with a leaner team and the primary intention for hiring a third party is to drive marketing initiatives outside of your current team’s skill set, hiring an agency is a better option than stretching your team thin and paying (in both mistakes and time) for them to learn the skills.
When You Have a Smaller In-House Team But Still Need To Hit Goals
Many marketing teams are currently facing layoffs and still have to hit goals despite operating with a leaner marketing team.
In this case, you likely don’t have the execution resources in-house, meaning hiring an agency is a better option as they can execute the strategy for you.
You also may have to amend the strategy itself to ensure it’s effective with your leaner team.
The only case where a marketing consultant may be a more effective solution is if they can identify and remove inefficiencies in the strategy, allowing your leaner team to deliver the same ROI with fewer resources.
When You Know You’re Looking for Long Term Execution
The longer the time frame is when you’re looking specifically for execution, the more likely it is that an agency will be able to support you. Even if agency staff changes, the core systems, processes, and talent pipeline will be there to make sure that execution continues smoothly.
While there are plenty of consultants who work with clients for years, the nature of working with an individual is that there is a single point of failure. If they ever are unavailable, go on vacation, get sick, or experience anything that is completely unrelated to their capability, things can come to a dead stop. That’s the risk of relying on one person.
Fractional CMO vs Consultant vs Agency
We realize that not every B2B SaaS company needs to work with an agency, yet many marketers we speak with are dissatisfied with the results achieved from working with a marketing consultant.
Specifically, here are a few common challenges:

A single individual’s skills and experiences are limited: Even if the consultant you hire has years of experience, there are a limited number of unique situations they’ve encountered and solved in comparison to an entire team. Similarly, a single person can’t be a specialist across multiple marketing channels.
Advice without action: A marketing consultant’s job is to provide strategic guidance and it’s the team’s responsibility to execute. Yet most teams usually fall short on the execution stage, rendering the entire partnership with the consultant ineffective.

To solve these problems we created a third option – our fractional CMO service.
Our fractional CMO service still resembles a traditional marketing consulting partnership, by focusing on strategic guidance rather than providing a done for you solution. However, it differs from a consulting service in two key ways:

Experience from an entire team: Rather than hiring a single consultant, our fractional CMO offering delivers strategic guidance from each of our team members. For example, if SEO is part of the marketing plan, our SEO specialists can provide a detailed SEO strategy and tactical execution guidance.
Action-oriented strategy with accountability: Most marketing consultants provide goals, but there’s little structured follow-up or accountability. Instead, we operate in two-week springs that are guided by a scorecard with measurable, bi-weekly goals, and we get on biweekly calls to navigate challenges as they arise.

By leveraging the experiences of multiple specialists and holding team members accountable, we’ve found that the fractional CMO option can be a much more effective option for those that don’t need a full service agency, but could benefit from additional strategic guidance and accountability.
What’s The Next Step?

						B2B SaaS companies are currently re-accelerating as demand picks up again in 2024, yet to achieve those goals, many of them need additional bench strength to aid their current team.
The process of hiring in-house takes significant time and resources, which isn’t realistic for most B2B SaaS companies given the uncertain market conditions and reduced budgets. Especially for teams that have unfortunately experienced team reductions recently.
The option is to choose between hiring an in-house marketer (or in-house marketing team) or a digital marketing agency.
A digital marketing agency can often be a good option as it provides more flexibility than hiring an in-house marketer. You can move faster and leverage the expertise of marketers who have implemented a repeatable proven process for multiple other SaaS companies just like yours.
But a lot of companies have had bad previous experiences with agencies, and going the agency route requires: 

Relinquishing some control
Having to trust people outside of their company with intellectual property and the outcome of getting them a return on their investment
Often a higher upfront (perceived) cost 

Why a perceived cost?
A common scenario we see in B2B SaaS is when a company is deciding between hiring one new full-time marketer or hiring an agency. But these aren’t really equivalent, because the varied skill sets needed to do digital marketing require different people to execute. And while an agency will have several people with different areas of expertise working on your marketing (albeit, part-time), one full-time employee very rarely possesses that entire range of skills needed. So the more accurate comparison when it comes to cost is hiring a demand generation team (of say, 3 in-house hires) versus an agency, in which case agencies often work out to be less upfront cost. 
With that said, the biggest difference we see in weighing the two options that often isn’t taken into account is: if you think about the number of data points that they can access when evaluating an agency versus an in-house candidate, there is typically a lot more information to base decisions off of when evaluating an agency — for whom having a website, a blog, a newsletter, webinar content, and case studies, among other things, are commonplace. So in the same way that marketing works better when you have more data, we think this applies to hiring marketers as well.
In this article, we’ll expand on this idea and discuss how companies should think about the costs associated with each option, as well as share specific recommendations for how they should evaluate agencies to find ones they can actually trust and who can actually deliver.
Note: We acknowledge that, yes, we’re biased in that we’re a marketing agency. And we’re going to assert in this article the ways in which we see choosing an agency over building an in-house team can be advantageous for companies making this decision. But throughout this article we’ll do our best to also acknowledge the counter-arguments that relate to the points we make. And by all means, we encourage you to go read Google’s top 10 articles on this topic. You’ll see the trends and the trade-offs that you should be considering, some of which we’ll cover below. 
When to consider agency vs. in-house hiring
Many of the SaaS marketers we talk to who are currently considering hiring either an agency or in-house marketer are often experiencing one of the following scenarios.
Need help deciding if hiring a marketing agency is right for you? Meet with us here and we’ll explore a few options together.
Scenario 1: Budget/staffing changes
If there were organizational changes to your marketing team (e.g., team members left), or your budget was drastically altered, your current resources may not be sufficient to execute the existing marketing plan and hit targets for 2023.
To adjust your current trajectory and achieve those goals, you’ll likely need more resources to execute the marketing plan and therefore must either hire for it.
Scenario 2: New marketing leaders
If you’ve recently started at a new SaaS company and are charged with hitting aggressive targets by the end of the year, a major lever you can pull to alter your current trajectory is the marketing team itself.
If the current team is underperforming, there are three main options you can consider:

Replace existing in-house marketers
Hire more in-house marketers
Replace the existing agency

Regardless of which option you choose, it’s essential to choose one of them if data shows that the current strategy is not on track to hit your goals – especially if you’re trying to make your mark as a new leader.
Scenario #3: Change in growth trajectory
If you have aggressive goals to hit by the end of the year and you need to dial up the execution speed to hit those goals, you don’t really have time to waste with hiring and onboarding.
Therefore, you’ll have to take into consideration the time (and cost) associated with both the in-house and agency hiring process.
While evaluating an agency may take some time, it’s typically much faster and more cost effective than finding, interviewing, and onboarding one or multiple in-house marketers.
Comparing the cost and value of in-house vs. agency hires
The following is food for thought on how to weigh the two options when it comes to investment and returns. It’s a model that’s meant to be useful, not in any way absolute or foolproof.
And frankly, just because one option is more or less affordable or expensive shouldn’t entirely dictate your decision. Depending on what your company values and what your marketing budget is, there are a lot of factors outside of cost alone that warrant influencing the direction you choose to go in.
With that said, let’s jump into our (read: purposely over-simplified) example.
Above we mentioned a common scenario: a company is deciding between hiring one new full-time marketer or hiring an agency. So let’s say there is a hypothetical company in this situation and in particular they’ve decided to hire a marketing manager. 
Here’s some additional context:

Their goal is to increase annual recurring revenue by $500k.
They have narrowed their search down to an in-house candidate and an agency candidate, both with equivalent capabilities (eg. years of experience, channel expertise, industry expertise, etc.). 
The in-house SEO hire will cost $6K/mo and the agency will cost $10k/mo. 

If they go with the in-house hire, because of the nature of the onboarding process and the systems the new hire will need to create in order to get up and running, they’ll hit their stride and really begin getting into the work 3 months in. (You might think, not at my company. Or, we’d move faster than that! If that’s true, ignore this point.)
But because they’re only one person, it takes them to the end of the year to hit that target. The company paid them $72k in salary, so they made $428k in profit on their investment by the end of that year. 
However, this profit figure isn’t entirely accurate as it only factors in the cost of the salary – not the full cost burden. The full cost burden would also include these expenses:

Recruiting & hiring costs
Equipment / office space
Onboarding & training
Benefits
Payroll
Bonuses
Availability (working hours, sick days, and vacations)

In addition, there’s the cost of lost time while you’re recruiting, hiring, and onboarding the new marketer. It may take weeks (even months!) to source, interview, and hire just 1 new in-house marketer.
Note: With the in-house hire, in addition to the time spent onboarding and creating systems for execution, the time it takes to hire — often a period of several months from search, screening, interviewing, selecting, and actually beginning — should also be taken into account. Granted, as we’ll discuss below, you should put ample effort and time into hiring an agency, but typically it can be done much faster than hiring the full time employee (as agencies are usually ready and willing to begin new client engagements).
While you’ll still typically have to spend some time onboarding an agency, it’s typically a much faster process than onboarding an in-house marketer as agencies already have systems and processes in place to expedite the new client onboarding process.
Now, let’s play out a scenario where the SaaS company chose to hire an agency instead.
Given that agencies have their operating systems in place already, access to the most sophisticated marketing tools, and multiple marketers involved with doing the work, they hit the ground running almost immediately, and are able to move faster to hit the revenue goal in the first six months. Again, they have equal capabilities to the in-house marketer, but systems take a long time to create, and already having those in place gives agencies a huge advantage on speed.
If they kept that pace going, by the end of the year, the SaaS company would have spent $120k on their fees, but they would have made them $1 million in revenue (or a profit of $880k when you minus their fees). The agency would have made the company more than twice as much as the in-house hire — again, solely based on them being one person, and having to set up their own systems to get things up and running.
At a 12% rate of overhead cost at the end of the year for the agency, and the in-house rate at 14.4%, the agency both works out to be more affordable, more profitable, and faster, all at the same time.
Finally, this doesn’t factor in the results that an agency versus an in-house marketer can bring to the table.
It’s unrealistic to expect a single in-house marketer to have the combined expertise as several specialized marketers working at an agency, nor is it realistic to expect an in-house marketer to deliver the same output working 40 hours per week as a team of marketers at an agency.
Therefore, the value derived from an agency will likely be much higher than an in-house marketer – regardless of that marketer’s talent.
And speaking of value, it’s important to compare not only the costs associated with hiring an agency versus an in-house marketer, but also the ROI derived from each.
This is because marketers all face a common challenge seeking sign-off on budget. Most stakeholders in an organization see marketing as a cost-center.
As a marketing leader, you’ll need to make a case for the value of your hire (either for a marketing agency or in-house marketer) to win budget. Otherwise, the executive team will likely reject your proposal as they strive to protect cashflow.
Here are just a few different modalities you can use to shift stakeholders’ from viewing marketing as a cost center to a value center and earn buy-in for a new hire:

Money Made
Money Saved
Time Saved

Below we’ll discuss how to frame each of these modalities to stakeholders, and some factors to consider for each modality when choosing between an in-house and agency hire.
Money Made
First, rather than just thinking about how much money you’re spending when hiring an agency or in-house marketer, think about the ROI they’re delivering.
For example, if you invest $100,000 per year into either a marketing agency or an in-house marketer, yet they deliver $1,000,000 in value annually, it should be a no-brainer for stakeholders to provide a $100,000 budget.
As you’re debating between hiring an in-house and agency marketer, it’s important to consider which one will give you higher compounding returns.
Here are recent examples of how we’ve paid for ourselves plus added significant revenue growth for our clients:


Money Saved
A smart hiring decision can also save your company money if it means that you can consolidate and cut expenses without slowing performance.
For example, if you’re considering hiring three new in-house marketers on $100,000 salaries, onboarding a single marketing agency for $150,000 to do the work of those three marketers could save you $150,000.
And that figure doesn’t account for the full cost burden on the in-house marketers, such as bonuses and benefits!
Time Saved
When you hire one marketer, the maximum amount of time they can dedicate to delivering value to the company in a regular work week is 40 hours. And that’s the maximum number of hours they contribute each week.
If you account for breaks and unplanned interruptions, 30 hours is a more realistic estimate that a full-time employee spends contributing value to the company each week.
Now think about all the things you want this marketing hire to accomplish. If you estimated how many hours needed to do the work to hit your goals, how long would it take them to do it all? It might amount to years.
When you hire an agency, you’re making an investment in a full marketing team that isn’t constrained by the availability of a single marketer.
Some agencies bill on time and materials, so you’ll have to consider their rates versus the adjusted hourly rate of an internal hire.
We don’t follow a time and materials model at Powered by Search.
We partner with our clients on a value-based model. You tell us what you want to achieve, and we put the resources behind it to get you there without nickel and dimming the time required to get there.
As a result, we get our clients to results faster, saving them countless hours and delays compared to hiring an in-house marketer.
Evaluating whether you should hire an agency or in-house marketer
There’s demand for both in-house marketers and marketing agencies because they each have unique pros and cons, and they’re often ideal for different use cases.
Here’s a brief overview of the unique advantages and disadvantages of both marketing agencies and in-house marketers:

The best of both worlds: leveraging in-house talent and marketing agencies together
As you can see in the table above, there are unique pros and cons to both in-house marketers and marketing agencies.
If you only use in-house resources, you may move too slowly to achieve your goals – especially if you have a small team with limited time for execution. In addition, betting the farm on a single person to change the trajectory of your marketing strategy and hit numbers by the end of the year is risky.
On the other hand, relying on a marketing agency to create and execute your entire marketing strategy might be too expensive and you may feel a loss of control. How do you know that the strategy they’re executing is working?
As you can see, neither option is definitively better than the other.
To take advantage of the benefits both marketing agencies and in-house marketers have to offer and cover each one’s shortcomings, consider using both of them together.
If you’re a marketing leader who needs to augment your team, you can hire an agency with a proven point-solution program that can quickly solve the specific challenge you’re facing (e.g., SEO, paid media, etc.).
However, you also need an in-house marketer who can manage the relationship and guide the agency so that they understand your product’s unique value, your customers’ pain points, and the general industry to ensure all marketing messaging is accurate and attuned to your brand.
If you’re a founder or investor and there currently isn’t a marketing leader in place, a marketing agency can act as a fractional marketing leader to help you get a marketing program off the ground.
The marketing agency you hire should have a proven process that can shorten the time to outcomes and results.
However, you should still eventually hire a marketing champion in-house to help the agency better understand your customers and product. In addition, as your brand evolves and grows, that marketer can also communicate those changes to the marketing agency so that everyone stays on the same page.
Otherwise, your marketing material won’t align with the core business and you’ll see off-brand messaging, low conversions, and high churn.
How to choose a B2B SaaS marketing agency you can trust
You can think about the process of selecting a digital agency as a series of stages:

Reviewing their online presence
Talking to their current or past clients
Having talks with the agency
Reviewing their proposal

What follows are our recommendations for each stage.
1. Review their online presence
The first step to evaluating a B2B SaaS marketing agency is to review their online presence so that you can gauge their credibility, determine their expertise, and identify their key differentiators.
To do this, you can search for pain points you want the agency to solve and see if they have content and case studies around those topics.
If the agency actively produces content on those pain points, it indicates that they specialize and have expertise in solving those challenges, and it also gives you insight into their systems and processes. You can then evaluate the logic of those systems and results achieved (from case studies) to estimate the likelihood of success if you were to work with them.
In addition, if they’re able to successfully get that pain point content in front of you, there’s a good chance they’ll be able to successfully get your pain point content in front of your customers.
You can also review their general credibility by searching their brand name on social media. This can surface unbiased client reviews, employee brand mentions, and partner comments. You can also look at comments their clients have left on the agency’s own social media posts.
As the employees in the agency are arguably the most significant variable that determine the results the agency can generate, looking at reviews on Glassdoor to gauge general employee satisfaction. You can also view the average employee tenure on LinkedIn. If the average tenure is less than a year or two, you’ll likely work with multiple account managers, which can disrupt the work process as the new manager is onboarded and learns about your company.
Finally, analyze their general marketing messaging and identify their key differentiators. For example, here at Powered By Search, we have a page that describes exactly how we’re unique from other marketing agencies.
If the agency doesn’t have a unique positioning statement, there’s a good chance they’re aiming to target everyone, which also means they don’t have systems designed specifically for B2B SaaS companies with your pain points.
In addition, if the agency can’t uniquely position its own business, it probably won’t effectively position your brand as a unique solution in the market.
2. Talk to their current or past clients
Any solid agency is going to have a “who we’ve worked with” section on their site for you to identify their clients.
So our recommendation for this step is to look at their “who we’ve worked with” section, and reach out to their clients. See if they’ll hop on a short call with you to learn about what their experience has been like. If they’re happy with the agency, they’re likely to want to support them and will often be happy to talk with you.
Alternatively, if they didn’t have a good experience with the agency, they may also be willing to share that. And that’s useful information to know, too.
Note: There are certain engagements that don’t work out for reasons outside of an agency’s control, so if you see or hear a sub-par review or two, take them seriously — but perhaps also take them within the context of the rest of what you can see about them in your research. In fact, if there aren’t any negative reviews, it might be a sign that they don’t have that much experience.
3. Speak with the agency
We think you can learn a lot about an agency from their sales process. Like the other areas of their business, if it’s tight and structured, that’s likely a reflection of the attention to detail that they bring to their client engagements. If it’s loosey-goosey, that might be a red flag.
When you speak with their internal team members, it’s also useful to gauge their active listening skills. For example, when you describe the problems you’ve been facing in an active marketing campaign — the ones you’re hoping they can help solve — are they actively framing that problem back to you and explaining potential solutions? (And later, do those show up in their proposals?)
The agencies that are most likely to meet your marketing needs are the ones who handle their sales process with care and an intention to deeply understand your company’s problems and goals.
4. Review their proposal
A final distinct advantage of evaluating agencies versus individual in-house hires is that they deliver actual plans — in the form of proposals — for meeting your marketing goals. Whereas it is very rare for an interviewee to come in with a full-on marketing plan.
The following are elements we recommend taking into account when reviewing agency proposals:

Does it reflect the problems and goals you discussed? (ie. how well were they listening?)
Are the objectives, KPIs, and marketing channels through which they’ll deliver clearly stated?
Are there clear descriptions of how you’ll work together?
Are their incentives aligned with yours? (ie. do their objectives connect to ROI and your bottom line?)

This ability to see a detailed path forward before you hire someone is invaluable when it comes to evaluating whether or not a marketing hire will take you in the direction you want to go.
How to get the most value from an agency partnership
If you’ve gone through the process above to evaluate and select your agency partner, you should have a successful relationship. If you’re not satisfied, it might be due to your approach to the agency partnership.
A few of the most common mistakes we see clients make when hiring a marketing agency that can cause an agency-client relationship to fall apart include:

Short term thinking: Great long-term marketing results, especially content marketing and SEO, don’t happen overnight. While it’s important to have some accountability metrics, give them space to create and execute long-term marketing plan that will produce compounding results.
Micromanaging: Once you’ve laid out expectations at the beginning of the engagement and you’re aligned on the vision, let the agency implement their systems and processes without interference. As long as they’re hitting numbers, there’s no need to micromanage.
Overstepping: You hired the agency to execute for you, so don’t try to do the work for them. For example, if you hired the agency to manage an ad account, don’t log into that account and start making changes. If you do, it could negatively impact the strategy they’ve already implemented.
Under communicating: While you don’t need to constantly message and call your agency partners regarding minor details, it’s important to remain aligned on the main marketing strategy and ensure the agency has the resources they need to succeed.

Therefore, the principles we emphasize to clients to ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial include:

Over-communicate: It’s a partnership and agencies need your input on product updates/feature releases, customer pain points, and other internal news. Your agency partner also needs to know what the company’s goals are so that we can adjust our strategy to hit those numbers. Alternatively, if you’re dissatisfied, speak up immediately to course correct and get back on track.
Collaborate: Be sure to show up to meetings prepared with required materials to keep the ball moving forward.
Trust, with accountability: We outline goals with our clients, lay out milestones and then report on each of those milestones. As long as the agency continues to deliver on the agreed-upon results, you should trust their judgment (but always be active in asking questions and sharing your input).

Take the next step in the hiring process now
When business owners and senior marketing leaders are debating whether to invest in an agency or add another in-house employee to their marketing department, there are many considerations worth taking into account. 
But typically, trusting who they hire and feeling a sense of confidence that they can deliver — based on their past experience — is the core of what companies making this decision care about most.
From our standpoint, the agency route provides the most data for evaluation when weighing candidates against each other, and is often the safest route to finding the best party for the job.
Especially going into 2024, if you’re operating with a reduced budget and need expert talent immediately to hit your goals, hiring an agency that can be quickly onboarded and provide access to a range of talented experts may be the best option.
At Powered By Search, we offer these resources to agencies and have proven blueprints that help B2B SaaS companies see higher returns on their marketing investments.
You can use the criteria outlined above to evaluate our own agency, and if it makes sense, you can request a free marketing plan from us to identify key growth opportunities.

						B2B SaaS Marketing Agency vs In-House: The Biggest Differences That No One Talks About

        Summarize with ChatGPT    

    
    

						B2B SaaS companies are currently re-accelerating as demand picks up again in 2024, yet to achieve those goals, many of them need additional bench strength to aid their current team.
The process of hiring in-house takes significant time and resources, which isn’t realistic for most B2B SaaS companies given the uncertain market conditions and reduced budgets. Especially for teams that have unfortunately experienced team reductions recently.
The option is to choose between hiring an in-house marketer (or in-house marketing team) or a digital marketing agency.
A digital marketing agency can often be a good option as it provides more flexibility than hiring an in-house marketer. You can move faster and leverage the expertise of marketers who have implemented a repeatable proven process for multiple other SaaS companies just like yours.
But a lot of companies have had bad previous experiences with agencies, and going the agency route requires: 

Relinquishing some control
Having to trust people outside of their company with intellectual property and the outcome of getting them a return on their investment
Often a higher upfront (perceived) cost 

Why a perceived cost?
A common scenario we see in B2B SaaS is when a company is deciding between hiring one new full-time marketer or hiring an agency. But these aren’t really equivalent, because the varied skill sets needed to do digital marketing require different people to execute. And while an agency will have several people with different areas of expertise working on your marketing (albeit, part-time), one full-time employee very rarely possesses that entire range of skills needed. So the more accurate comparison when it comes to cost is hiring a demand generation team (of say, 3 in-house hires) versus an agency, in which case agencies often work out to be less upfront cost. 
With that said, the biggest difference we see in weighing the two options that often isn’t taken into account is: if you think about the number of data points that they can access when evaluating an agency versus an in-house candidate, there is typically a lot more information to base decisions off of when evaluating an agency — for whom having a website, a blog, a newsletter, webinar content, and case studies, among other things, are commonplace. So in the same way that marketing works better when you have more data, we think this applies to hiring marketers as well.
In this article, we’ll expand on this idea and discuss how companies should think about the costs associated with each option, as well as share specific recommendations for how they should evaluate agencies to find ones they can actually trust and who can actually deliver.
Note: We acknowledge that, yes, we’re biased in that we’re a marketing agency. And we’re going to assert in this article the ways in which we see choosing an agency over building an in-house team can be advantageous for companies making this decision. But throughout this article we’ll do our best to also acknowledge the counter-arguments that relate to the points we make. And by all means, we encourage you to go read Google’s top 10 articles on this topic. You’ll see the trends and the trade-offs that you should be considering, some of which we’ll cover below. 
When to consider agency vs. in-house hiring
Many of the SaaS marketers we talk to who are currently considering hiring either an agency or in-house marketer are often experiencing one of the following scenarios.
Need help deciding if hiring a marketing agency is right for you? Meet with us here and we’ll explore a few options together.
Scenario 1: Budget/staffing changes
If there were organizational changes to your marketing team (e.g., team members left), or your budget was drastically altered, your current resources may not be sufficient to execute the existing marketing plan and hit targets for 2023.
To adjust your current trajectory and achieve those goals, you’ll likely need more resources to execute the marketing plan and therefore must either hire for it.
Scenario 2: New marketing leaders
If you’ve recently started at a new SaaS company and are charged with hitting aggressive targets by the end of the year, a major lever you can pull to alter your current trajectory is the marketing team itself.
If the current team is underperforming, there are three main options you can consider:

Replace existing in-house marketers
Hire more in-house marketers
Replace the existing agency

Regardless of which option you choose, it’s essential to choose one of them if data shows that the current strategy is not on track to hit your goals – especially if you’re trying to make your mark as a new leader.
Scenario #3: Change in growth trajectory
If you have aggressive goals to hit by the end of the year and you need to dial up the execution speed to hit those goals, you don’t really have time to waste with hiring and onboarding.
Therefore, you’ll have to take into consideration the time (and cost) associated with both the in-house and agency hiring process.
While evaluating an agency may take some time, it’s typically much faster and more cost effective than finding, interviewing, and onboarding one or multiple in-house marketers.
Comparing the cost and value of in-house vs. agency hires
The following is food for thought on how to weigh the two options when it comes to investment and returns. It’s a model that’s meant to be useful, not in any way absolute or foolproof.
And frankly, just because one option is more or less affordable or expensive shouldn’t entirely dictate your decision. Depending on what your company values and what your marketing budget is, there are a lot of factors outside of cost alone that warrant influencing the direction you choose to go in.
With that said, let’s jump into our (read: purposely over-simplified) example.
Above we mentioned a common scenario: a company is deciding between hiring one new full-time marketer or hiring an agency. So let’s say there is a hypothetical company in this situation and in particular they’ve decided to hire a marketing manager. 
Here’s some additional context:

Their goal is to increase annual recurring revenue by $500k.
They have narrowed their search down to an in-house candidate and an agency candidate, both with equivalent capabilities (eg. years of experience, channel expertise, industry expertise, etc.). 
The in-house SEO hire will cost $6K/mo and the agency will cost $10k/mo. 

If they go with the in-house hire, because of the nature of the onboarding process and the systems the new hire will need to create in order to get up and running, they’ll hit their stride and really begin getting into the work 3 months in. (You might think, not at my company. Or, we’d move faster than that! If that’s true, ignore this point.)
But because they’re only one person, it takes them to the end of the year to hit that target. The company paid them $72k in salary, so they made $428k in profit on their investment by the end of that year. 
However, this profit figure isn’t entirely accurate as it only factors in the cost of the salary – not the full cost burden. The full cost burden would also include these expenses:

Recruiting & hiring costs
Equipment / office space
Onboarding & training
Benefits
Payroll
Bonuses
Availability (working hours, sick days, and vacations)

In addition, there’s the cost of lost time while you’re recruiting, hiring, and onboarding the new marketer. It may take weeks (even months!) to source, interview, and hire just 1 new in-house marketer.
Note: With the in-house hire, in addition to the time spent onboarding and creating systems for execution, the time it takes to hire — often a period of several months from search, screening, interviewing, selecting, and actually beginning — should also be taken into account. Granted, as we’ll discuss below, you should put ample effort and time into hiring an agency, but typically it can be done much faster than hiring the full time employee (as agencies are usually ready and willing to begin new client engagements).
While you’ll still typically have to spend some time onboarding an agency, it’s typically a much faster process than onboarding an in-house marketer as agencies already have systems and processes in place to expedite the new client onboarding process.
Now, let’s play out a scenario where the SaaS company chose to hire an agency instead.
Given that agencies have their operating systems in place already, access to the most sophisticated marketing tools, and multiple marketers involved with doing the work, they hit the ground running almost immediately, and are able to move faster to hit the revenue goal in the first six months. Again, they have equal capabilities to the in-house marketer, but systems take a long time to create, and already having those in place gives agencies a huge advantage on speed.
If they kept that pace going, by the end of the year, the SaaS company would have spent $120k on their fees, but they would have made them $1 million in revenue (or a profit of $880k when you minus their fees). The agency would have made the company more than twice as much as the in-house hire — again, solely based on them being one person, and having to set up their own systems to get things up and running.
At a 12% rate of overhead cost at the end of the year for the agency, and the in-house rate at 14.4%, the agency both works out to be more affordable, more profitable, and faster, all at the same time.
Finally, this doesn’t factor in the results that an agency versus an in-house marketer can bring to the table.
It’s unrealistic to expect a single in-house marketer to have the combined expertise as several specialized marketers working at an agency, nor is it realistic to expect an in-house marketer to deliver the same output working 40 hours per week as a team of marketers at an agency.
Therefore, the value derived from an agency will likely be much higher than an in-house marketer – regardless of that marketer’s talent.
And speaking of value, it’s important to compare not only the costs associated with hiring an agency versus an in-house marketer, but also the ROI derived from each.
This is because marketers all face a common challenge seeking sign-off on budget. Most stakeholders in an organization see marketing as a cost-center.
As a marketing leader, you’ll need to make a case for the value of your hire (either for a marketing agency or in-house marketer) to win budget. Otherwise, the executive team will likely reject your proposal as they strive to protect cashflow.
Here are just a few different modalities you can use to shift stakeholders’ from viewing marketing as a cost center to a value center and earn buy-in for a new hire:

Money Made
Money Saved
Time Saved

Below we’ll discuss how to frame each of these modalities to stakeholders, and some factors to consider for each modality when choosing between an in-house and agency hire.
Money Made
First, rather than just thinking about how much money you’re spending when hiring an agency or in-house marketer, think about the ROI they’re delivering.
For example, if you invest $100,000 per year into either a marketing agency or an in-house marketer, yet they deliver $1,000,000 in value annually, it should be a no-brainer for stakeholders to provide a $100,000 budget.
As you’re debating between hiring an in-house and agency marketer, it’s important to consider which one will give you higher compounding returns.
Here are recent examples of how we’ve paid for ourselves plus added significant revenue growth for our clients:


Money Saved
A smart hiring decision can also save your company money if it means that you can consolidate and cut expenses without slowing performance.
For example, if you’re considering hiring three new in-house marketers on $100,000 salaries, onboarding a single marketing agency for $150,000 to do the work of those three marketers could save you $150,000.
And that figure doesn’t account for the full cost burden on the in-house marketers, such as bonuses and benefits!
Time Saved
When you hire one marketer, the maximum amount of time they can dedicate to delivering value to the company in a regular work week is 40 hours. And that’s the maximum number of hours they contribute each week.
If you account for breaks and unplanned interruptions, 30 hours is a more realistic estimate that a full-time employee spends contributing value to the company each week.
Now think about all the things you want this marketing hire to accomplish. If you estimated how many hours needed to do the work to hit your goals, how long would it take them to do it all? It might amount to years.
When you hire an agency, you’re making an investment in a full marketing team that isn’t constrained by the availability of a single marketer.
Some agencies bill on time and materials, so you’ll have to consider their rates versus the adjusted hourly rate of an internal hire.
We don’t follow a time and materials model at Powered by Search.
We partner with our clients on a value-based model. You tell us what you want to achieve, and we put the resources behind it to get you there without nickel and dimming the time required to get there.
As a result, we get our clients to results faster, saving them countless hours and delays compared to hiring an in-house marketer.
Evaluating whether you should hire an agency or in-house marketer
There’s demand for both in-house marketers and marketing agencies because they each have unique pros and cons, and they’re often ideal for different use cases.
Here’s a brief overview of the unique advantages and disadvantages of both marketing agencies and in-house marketers:

The best of both worlds: leveraging in-house talent and marketing agencies together
As you can see in the table above, there are unique pros and cons to both in-house marketers and marketing agencies.
If you only use in-house resources, you may move too slowly to achieve your goals – especially if you have a small team with limited time for execution. In addition, betting the farm on a single person to change the trajectory of your marketing strategy and hit numbers by the end of the year is risky.
On the other hand, relying on a marketing agency to create and execute your entire marketing strategy might be too expensive and you may feel a loss of control. How do you know that the strategy they’re executing is working?
As you can see, neither option is definitively better than the other.
To take advantage of the benefits both marketing agencies and in-house marketers have to offer and cover each one’s shortcomings, consider using both of them together.
If you’re a marketing leader who needs to augment your team, you can hire an agency with a proven point-solution program that can quickly solve the specific challenge you’re facing (e.g., SEO, paid media, etc.).
However, you also need an in-house marketer who can manage the relationship and guide the agency so that they understand your product’s unique value, your customers’ pain points, and the general industry to ensure all marketing messaging is accurate and attuned to your brand.
If you’re a founder or investor and there currently isn’t a marketing leader in place, a marketing agency can act as a fractional marketing leader to help you get a marketing program off the ground.
The marketing agency you hire should have a proven process that can shorten the time to outcomes and results.
However, you should still eventually hire a marketing champion in-house to help the agency better understand your customers and product. In addition, as your brand evolves and grows, that marketer can also communicate those changes to the marketing agency so that everyone stays on the same page.
Otherwise, your marketing material won’t align with the core business and you’ll see off-brand messaging, low conversions, and high churn.
How to choose a B2B SaaS marketing agency you can trust
You can think about the process of selecting a digital agency as a series of stages:

Reviewing their online presence
Talking to their current or past clients
Having talks with the agency
Reviewing their proposal

What follows are our recommendations for each stage.
1. Review their online presence
The first step to evaluating a B2B SaaS marketing agency is to review their online presence so that you can gauge their credibility, determine their expertise, and identify their key differentiators.
To do this, you can search for pain points you want the agency to solve and see if they have content and case studies around those topics.
If the agency actively produces content on those pain points, it indicates that they specialize and have expertise in solving those challenges, and it also gives you insight into their systems and processes. You can then evaluate the logic of those systems and results achieved (from case studies) to estimate the likelihood of success if you were to work with them.
In addition, if they’re able to successfully get that pain point content in front of you, there’s a good chance they’ll be able to successfully get your pain point content in front of your customers.
You can also review their general credibility by searching their brand name on social media. This can surface unbiased client reviews, employee brand mentions, and partner comments. You can also look at comments their clients have left on the agency’s own social media posts.
As the employees in the agency are arguably the most significant variable that determine the results the agency can generate, looking at reviews on Glassdoor to gauge general employee satisfaction. You can also view the average employee tenure on LinkedIn. If the average tenure is less than a year or two, you’ll likely work with multiple account managers, which can disrupt the work process as the new manager is onboarded and learns about your company.
Finally, analyze their general marketing messaging and identify their key differentiators. For example, here at Powered By Search, we have a page that describes exactly how we’re unique from other marketing agencies.
If the agency doesn’t have a unique positioning statement, there’s a good chance they’re aiming to target everyone, which also means they don’t have systems designed specifically for B2B SaaS companies with your pain points.
In addition, if the agency can’t uniquely position its own business, it probably won’t effectively position your brand as a unique solution in the market.
2. Talk to their current or past clients
Any solid agency is going to have a “who we’ve worked with” section on their site for you to identify their clients.
So our recommendation for this step is to look at their “who we’ve worked with” section, and reach out to their clients. See if they’ll hop on a short call with you to learn about what their experience has been like. If they’re happy with the agency, they’re likely to want to support them and will often be happy to talk with you.
Alternatively, if they didn’t have a good experience with the agency, they may also be willing to share that. And that’s useful information to know, too.
Note: There are certain engagements that don’t work out for reasons outside of an agency’s control, so if you see or hear a sub-par review or two, take them seriously — but perhaps also take them within the context of the rest of what you can see about them in your research. In fact, if there aren’t any negative reviews, it might be a sign that they don’t have that much experience.
3. Speak with the agency
We think you can learn a lot about an agency from their sales process. Like the other areas of their business, if it’s tight and structured, that’s likely a reflection of the attention to detail that they bring to their client engagements. If it’s loosey-goosey, that might be a red flag.
When you speak with their internal team members, it’s also useful to gauge their active listening skills. For example, when you describe the problems you’ve been facing in an active marketing campaign — the ones you’re hoping they can help solve — are they actively framing that problem back to you and explaining potential solutions? (And later, do those show up in their proposals?)
The agencies that are most likely to meet your marketing needs are the ones who handle their sales process with care and an intention to deeply understand your company’s problems and goals.
4. Review their proposal
A final distinct advantage of evaluating agencies versus individual in-house hires is that they deliver actual plans — in the form of proposals — for meeting your marketing goals. Whereas it is very rare for an interviewee to come in with a full-on marketing plan.
The following are elements we recommend taking into account when reviewing agency proposals:

Does it reflect the problems and goals you discussed? (ie. how well were they listening?)
Are the objectives, KPIs, and marketing channels through which they’ll deliver clearly stated?
Are there clear descriptions of how you’ll work together?
Are their incentives aligned with yours? (ie. do their objectives connect to ROI and your bottom line?)

This ability to see a detailed path forward before you hire someone is invaluable when it comes to evaluating whether or not a marketing hire will take you in the direction you want to go.
How to get the most value from an agency partnership
If you’ve gone through the process above to evaluate and select your agency partner, you should have a successful relationship. If you’re not satisfied, it might be due to your approach to the agency partnership.
A few of the most common mistakes we see clients make when hiring a marketing agency that can cause an agency-client relationship to fall apart include:

Short term thinking: Great long-term marketing results, especially content marketing and SEO, don’t happen overnight. While it’s important to have some accountability metrics, give them space to create and execute long-term marketing plan that will produce compounding results.
Micromanaging: Once you’ve laid out expectations at the beginning of the engagement and you’re aligned on the vision, let the agency implement their systems and processes without interference. As long as they’re hitting numbers, there’s no need to micromanage.
Overstepping: You hired the agency to execute for you, so don’t try to do the work for them. For example, if you hired the agency to manage an ad account, don’t log into that account and start making changes. If you do, it could negatively impact the strategy they’ve already implemented.
Under communicating: While you don’t need to constantly message and call your agency partners regarding minor details, it’s important to remain aligned on the main marketing strategy and ensure the agency has the resources they need to succeed.

Therefore, the principles we emphasize to clients to ensure the partnership is mutually beneficial include:

Over-communicate: It’s a partnership and agencies need your input on product updates/feature releases, customer pain points, and other internal news. Your agency partner also needs to know what the company’s goals are so that we can adjust our strategy to hit those numbers. Alternatively, if you’re dissatisfied, speak up immediately to course correct and get back on track.
Collaborate: Be sure to show up to meetings prepared with required materials to keep the ball moving forward.
Trust, with accountability: We outline goals with our clients, lay out milestones and then report on each of those milestones. As long as the agency continues to deliver on the agreed-upon results, you should trust their judgment (but always be active in asking questions and sharing your input).

						Is updating your website really going to meaningfully boost conversions?
Many marketers don’t know when they should invest in a website redesign as it can often seem like a vanity cost.
Instead of just hoping that rearchitecting the website magically drives more demo signups, we first identify if the company is experiencing any of the following three pain points, as a website redesign may be a viable solution to solving those problems and increasing conversions:

The website is underperforming: There are multiple reasons why your website might not receive enough traffic or visibility, but a poor website architecture is certainly one potential cause. If search engines can’t intuitively crawl the website, it probably won’t rank. Confusing navigation can also frustrate users and harm demo signup conversion rates.
The “look and feel” is noticeably dated in comparison to competitors: The brand design is a prospect’s first impression of the company. Unfortunately, if a competitor’s website design is noticeably better than your brand’s design, that competitor will automatically have an edge before the prospect even begins the buyer journey.
The website is difficult for marketing stakeholders to maintain: Some websites are built by developers for developers, meaning that it isn’t easy for non-technical people (like marketing stakeholders) to quickly make important changes and adjustments. This slows growth by creating project bottlenecks as marketers can’t immediately implement necessary changes.

If you’re experiencing any of the above three issues mentioned above, a website redesign may be the best solution to improve performance.
However, simply changing the design and feel of the website won’t magically increase conversions. Instead, you must identify the user experience issues costing conversions and then adjust the website accordingly.
Identifying these issues and diagnosing them can be tricky, so we created the authority architecture framework. It’s a proven SaaS website architecture framework that consistently turns mediocre SaaS websites into demand generation machines that attract, engage, and convert your ideal customers. In this post, we’ll explain:

Why the traditional approach to building and architecting a SaaS website is ineffective.
How our authority architecture framework works and why it consistently delivers results.
Real results we’ve produced by using the authority architecture framework.

Why The Traditional Approach To Building a B2B SaaS Website is Flawed
The process of designing a SaaS website usually goes a little like this:

Collect random inspiration from other SaaS websites for a mood board
Ask product, engineering, customer service, and sales teams what they need
Design the website by committee

As a result, the website probably looks visually identical to thousands of other SaaS sites (pastel colors, vectors, etc.) who have also Googled ‘SaaS website design tips,’ making your brand immediately appear undifferentiated.
However, the bigger problem is that there’s no strategy built into the website to accommodate visitors at different stages of the customer journey.
This is a problem, because not everyone visiting your website is ready to schedule a demo. For some people, the next step in the user journey may be learning about how the product works while others may need to learn why your product is better or different from competing products.
So if a CTA to schedule a demo is the only clear next step on the website, you’ll likely permanently lose all of the other prospects in earlier stages of the customer journey.
Additionally, every prospect starts the customer journey by educating themselves on how the product solves their pain points. If that information isn’t clearly available and they aren’t able to progress to the next step of the customer journey, you won’t have any late stage prospects coming to your website that are ready to schedule a demo.
Two different customer journeys for a SaaS product
As a result, you probably won’t receive any demo signups. Or, if you do receive some signups, they probably aren’t qualified prospects, meaning the website still probably won’t generate paying customers.
In addition, if the information on your website isn’t organized in an orderly fashion, it will also be difficult for search engines to crawl the website, which can negatively impact search engine rankings.
The Solution – B2B SaaS Authority Architecture Framework
In response, we’ve created the Authority Architecture — a practical site map that we’ve used to produce high converting SaaS websites for dozens of clients.
Unlike the traditional methods of constructing a SaaS website, the first step of the authority architecture framework is considering the various stages of the customer journey. Then, we structure the website to accommodate the main user journeys. As a result, the website is not only unique from other SaaS websites, but it also is highly effective at moving users through the buyer process and ultimately drives conversions.
This visual framework is designed to show SaaS companies how to structure their site, but also helps marketers see where content and resources should be strategically placed.

Results We’ve Produced Using The Authority Architecture Framework
Before showing the step by step process of executing the Authority Architecture framework, here are a few results we’ve produced by using it on our own clients.
One SaaS client we implemented it on in early 2022 experienced a strong increase in organic-sourced leads quarter-over-quarter:

We also implemented it for an enterprise relationship management SaaS, and it helped them achieve a near-immediate 4x increase in non-branded organic impressions.

Another one of our clients, a SaaS in the field service industry, was running an outdated website that required significant developer maintenance and drove minimal visitor engagement.
We deployed our B2B SaaS Authority Architecture in early 2021 to completely overhaul their website experience and installed a clean CMS that the marketing team could use daily without involving the web team.
Here are the year-over-year results these changes helped them achieve:

2x demos from organic search
186% increase in organic traffic
800% increase in organic impressions

How We Deploy The Authority Architecture Framework
At Powered By Search, we think in terms of attention, connection, and conversion. In this article, we’ll go through each section of this Authority SaaS Website Design Map, with screenshots, and focus on how to build a connection by using SaaS website best practices to speak to prospects in a way that will make a lasting first impression.

Homepage

We all know the basics of a SaaS homepage: a compelling headline, an eye-catching product hero shot (or explainer video clip), an obvious demo or free trial Call-to-Action (CTA), along with a clean user interface — focusing on providing a simple user experience. And most SaaS companies also know about the impact of social proof elements — such as testimonials and customer logos.
These are standard best practices and key design elements that build trust and convert visitors.
However, we often find that many SaaS website homepage designs are poorly optimized for doing the one thing that really matters – transforming an anonymous website visitor into a known prospect.
Specifically, most SaaS homepages are very vague in an attempt to not turn off any potential customers, but it actually has the opposite effect. Instead of igniting curiosity, many visitors are simply confused about what the product is and how it will help them solve their problems, so they simply leave the website.
Another common mistake is that the homepage tries to accomplish too many things at once. For example, if you’re trying to accommodate each customer journey, you might end up overloading the user with too much information, which turns them off and causes them to leave.
While this is a well-intentioned mistake, there’s a better method to accommodate the different user journeys without overloading the prospect.
To solve these problems, here’s the Homepage formula we use:

Headlines: We turn declarative statements into a question-based value proposition that answers “Why should I choose you over your competition?”
Lead Magnet CTA: Offering a lead magnet on your home page guides top and middle funnel visitors further down the funnel.
Value Propositions: Home page copy that talks about the benefits of your product and the pain points it alleviates.
Pillar Blog Posts: Internal links to top content that targets each stage of the funnel so no visitor is left unsure of the next step to take.
Enhanced Visuals: Showcasing your actual product in action, and not generic stock images

We’ll expand on these in more detail below.
Headlines
Many headlines are declarative statements that fail to communicate the value proposition of the company or touch on a key pain point the product solves. For example, a tagline like “Changing the world one entrepreneur at a time” doesn’t really tell you what the company does.
If the visitor doesn’t immediately understand what your product does or how it solves their problems, they’ll likely leave.
Another issue is that the tagline doesn’t communicate how you’re different from the competition.
For example, any CRM solution could have the tagline “All-in-One Customer Relationship Management.”
While this tagline clearly communicates that it’s a CRM platform, it doesn’t communicate the pain point it solves and how it is different from other CRMs.
So instead, we construct headlines by asking the following questions:

What does the product do and what’s the main pain point it solves?
How is it different from other competitors?

If you’re selling an enterprise CRM, a better tagline might be something like, “Are your enterprise leads going cold?”
This taps into a clear pain point that someone shopping for an enterprise CRM might experience.
Once we have the reader’s attention, we’ll dive deeper into the pain point below the headline to keep their attention. For example, we might mention something like, “Buyer cycles for enterprise companies are usually 6-9 months minimum, and a key reason why most leads go cold is because you don’t have a way to efficiently track leads and follow-up with them in a timely manner.”
Once the prospect understands that you can solve their problem and they can see how you’re different from the competition, they’ll be intrigued enough that you can direct them to the next step of the buyer journey.
Lead Magnet CTA
For many SaaS companies, creating a homepage lead magnet CTA is an afterthought. They miss the opportunity to educate people or provide added value to prospects who are in the middle of the funnel.
If your SaaS product is relatively low Annual Contract Value (ACV) — say, circa $1200 — you should showcase a free usable template or toolkit in your lead magnet Call-to-Action (CTA). This is a functional and valuable offer. It’s not quite the software, but it gives a preview for the real benefits the person will experience once they’ve signed up to a free trial or demo.
For higher ACV SaaS products — say, $50,000 or more — the buying decision is more complex. In this context, the lead magnet CTA should provide detailed pre-purchase education. This could be a “State of the Industry” report, a playbook for integrations, or a comparison between enterprise-level solutions.

Value Props: Pros Without Cons
We got this idea from Conversion Rate Experts, who talk about writing value propositions to talk about a benefit and the pain point the benefit alleviates — but worded in a way in which both are positive.
So, for example, a chatbot or support automation software might say something like:
“Resolve complaints in minutes, without having to hire a customer service team.”
The “resolve complaints in minutes” is the benefit, and the “without having to hire a customer service team” is the pain point that it resolves. This is a concise alternative to focusing on the pain point negatively, for example “it’s an expensive hassle to hire and train a customer service team, but…”.
SaaS product marketers often want to bury the pain points and instead highlight the benefits of the solution. However, highlighting the pain point is actually a great way to create deeper connections with website visitors and earn their trust.
Pillar Blog Posts
Many SaaS companies list the most recent blog posts on their homepage.
However, the homepage real estate is the most precious and the blog posts on it tend to generate the most traffic. So we take advantage of this by always listing the best performing blog posts (those that drive the most engagement, demos signups, or lead magnet downloads) on the homepage.
Alternatively, you can feed in your best three blog posts that target each stage of the funnel — top, middle, and bottom.
Each one of these will provide a unique journey for the prospect.
For example, a top-of-funnel blog post could feature a story of a customer solving problems that you know many of your prospects face — which can help visitors that need to become problem-aware. A bottom-of-funnel blog post could be one that discusses your pricing, or compares your product to a competitor.
How It Works

If a prospect visits the How it Works page, they’re interested in the logistics of the solution.
In an effort to hide critical product details from competitors, many SaaS companies talk about the product on a vague high level and hide the most compelling details of how the software works for the demo.
The problem with locking the most critical information behind the demo signup gate — plus requiring the prospect to turn up and watch it — is that most prospects will just leave and purchase from a competitor that does clearly state how the product works and how it will solve their problems.
You can’t really blame prospects – if one brand shows them exactly how they can solve their problem, why would that prospect go to the trouble of signing up for a demo with a brand that may or may not be able to solve their problem?
To give prospects the details they need to make an informed decision, we believe the most important elements of How it Works are the Feature & Benefit pages and the Use Case pages.
So, let’s dig into how the best SaaS companies can get these elements right.
Feature & Benefit Pages
An effective Feature & Benefit page (a Product Page) for a B2B SaaS website needs to address 4 key questions:

Does the product match what the visitors are searching for?
Can it do what they need and solve their problems?
Would purchasing this product be a worthwhile investment?
And finally, what should they do next?

As we mentioned in the How It Works section, many SaaS websites keep the information on the dedicated feature and product overview pages shallow in an effort to conceal key information from competitors.
For example, there might be a generic screenshot of the product and a high level overview of how it works, but as a result, prospects don’t actually understand what it does.

Instead, you want to create a B2B SaaS product page that answers the questions of every person at each stage of the buyer journey.
Therefore, here’s the basic framework we use:

Point 1: State The Feature
Point 2: Pain Point Question
Point 3: Benefit of Using The Feature
Point 4: Proof to Support Benefit Claim


To help you visualize this concept, let’s assume we’re talking about a web-based accounting software. In this case, the Feature & Benefit pages should be structured as follows:

Feature: “Send invoices effortlessly!”
Pain Point Question: “Are you wasting time by sending invoices manually?”
Benefit: “Get paid faster, without having to chase clients every week.”
Proof: A customer story or testimonial that supports your benefit claim. “I used to spend hours each month manually sending invoices. Sometimes I would get busy and send them late or forget to send them altogether. Now that I use (brand name), it only takes me a few minutes per month to send invoices and I’m always paid on time.”

Here’s why we recommend this structure:
Firstly, point #1 (Feature) and #2 (Pain Point Question) pair the feature with the pain point it solves. This lets you talk about a feature in the context of its benefit and will resonate with the prospect who has a pain point.
Point #3 (Benefit) hits the “pro without con” line, doubling down on the pain point. Finally, point #4 gives credibility and backup to show how the product has been practically applied, with great results.
To help you visualize this structure in action, here’s an example we did for a client.
It starts with the feature; An API protection solution that just works.
Then, it discusses the pain point; Most API security starts with a complex product that requires headcount to manage. The next paragraph introduces how the solution solves that problem and provides more details on the feature itself.

 
As you scroll down, you’ll see that the customer testimonial supports the claims made above (that ThreatX makes it super easy to identify and block API attacks).
Finally, we drive it home with a “pro without con” style benefit. In this case, the pro is detecting and blocking threats in the APIs, and the “without con” is that your team doesn’t need another tool to manage.

 
Note: A lot of SaaS clients come to us and say they don’t have a customer testimonial like this. If that’s the case for you, write one and find an existing customer that matches. Actually go to them and ask if they’re willing to write a similar testimonial or stand behind this one, tweaking it to however it applies to them. Don’t wait for it — look at your customers and find a quote that matches the story you want to tell. Honesty in the testimonial is paramount.
Use Cases
Often, the fastest way to quickly communicate how something works and its value is by giving an example of it in action.
This is the job of the use case page.
For example, let’s say you have a membership management software (like our friends at Wild Apricot). Users are typically teachers, local associations, little leagues, and community groups. They often start in Excel, but as their membership database grows, the document keeps crashing. This is a real and acute pain point.
In this scenario, one Use Case would tell the story of how Wild Apricot has eased the pain for real customers by giving them a reliable, smooth, and fast way to manage members. It would talk about how Excel would crash at inopportune times, and show how this messed up operations. SaaS to the rescue!
Use Case pages expand on the information in Feature & Benefit pages — which usually don’t have space for such a detailed story. They also tap into the Who It’s For section of the website — which is something we discuss in the next part of this article.
Loom’s Use Case Pages
Who It’s For (i.e. Not Just Solutions or Verticals Pages)

Many SaaS websites build pages that address the solution it provides or a particular vertical it serves (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.).
However, addressing a single vertical is insufficient because there are typically multiple different people involved in the buyer journey for an enterprise B2B SaaS product, and ignoring one or multiple avatars involved in the purchase process can cost you a conversion.
For example, if the person who will use the product understands how it will make their life easier, but the stakeholder signing off doesn’t understand how it will make the company more money, the sale might fall through.
To solve this problem, we ensure each “who it’s for” page speaks to a specific buyer persona (e.g., the specific role or job title) involved in the purchase process.
Here’s a great example from one of our clients, Pabau.
You can see that we have “Who Its For” pages by role (practice owners, practice managers, treatment providers, etc.) as each of them will use the product differently and receive different benefits from it.

 
For example on the page for practice owners, we show how the product will help them drive more revenue (reducing no-shows, improving online booking conversions, etc.), as revenue is what they care about the most.

 
In contrast, the page for marketers shows how the product will make them more efficient by automating tasks and provide the data they need to improve their marketing strategy.

 
There is also a “Who Its For” page by industry (e.g., medi-aesthetic, cosmetic surgeries, etc.) so that each industry can see how the product will aid their specific use case.
How Is Who It’s For Different from Features and Use Cases?
These pages are different because they are explicitly geared towards a particular individual persona. There’s no subtlety — just obvious examples of how the software positively impacts their job.
This is the key thing to remember: we often use the same stories, features, and use cases as on other pages, but the information is angled more precisely to an individual. In my opinion, most SaaS websites are too paranoid about repeating the same content in various areas. On the contrary, we believe that you should double-down on the most compelling stories, and apply them in ways that make sense for each area of the site. If you look at what we include in the Feature & Benefit pages, the Use Cases, and the Who It’s For section of a website, you’ll see a lot of overlap. This is purposeful.
It’s not about only using one message once. Instead, you should be shaping your value proposition in different ways, with a different emphasis for different pages. It’s website personalization without the tech.

The Remarketing Benefits of Who It’s For
The Who It’s For section can also power your remarketing engine, because you can target specific audiences after they’ve been on the site.
When they hit one of the avatar pages — and/or spend a certain amount of time on a page, you can retarget them with relevant pain point focused content in their feed. We call this strategy the Boomerang Method and discuss it in more detail in our remarketing guide.
This can also be applied to the Use Cases — where you can glean that a user is particularly interested in a certain application of the SaaS product to solve a certain problem.
Pricing Page

All SaaS websites should feature information about pricing, whether it is explicit in dollars or not. For higher level enterprise SaaS products, it’s often not even possible to give numbers due to the complexity of custom integrations. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a pricing page.
The workaround might be something to pre-qualify prospects, like:
“We don’t have standardized pricing options, but we might be a good fit for you if you have a growth team of more than ten people and you’ve already invested in [Expensive Solution X] or [Expensive Solution Y].”
This sends an implicit message that your SaaS product is geared towards bigger teams and hefty budgets.
However, for most lower-ACV SaaS companies, we recommend the standard 3-tier pricing structure. And without exception, in our opinion every SaaS pricing table should include a non-priced “Enterprise” (or similar) field. This can simply lead to a contact form to get in touch with your sales team.
Someone who fills this out is signaling that they want to “fly business class” — and that they couldn’t possibly take their boss an invoice for $99. By not having this option, you might be missing out on revenue, or you might even dissuade the highest-tier potential customers from signing up.
Finally, if possible, you should show how your pricing compares to competitors. Basecamp does this better than any other SaaS product I’ve seen:

 
Why Us & Origin Story

Next up in the SaaS website architecture: Why Us and Origin Story.
This is where you pitch your brand as something more than just a software product. A lot of SaaS companies get blinded by the black and white of wanting conversions, and they get obsessed with selling the product’s value proposition. They don’t invest a lot of time or energy in these “softer” parts of the website.
But a lot of buyers are looking for more. They want to understand the culture behind the organization, the commitment to social responsibility, and the bigger long-term mission.
Remember: the customer is entering into a subscription model, so they’ll be interacting with your brand on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. They need to know what you stand for — because you’re becoming a colleague.

Blog

Blog pages can quickly become the most trafficked webpages of a B2B SaaS website, but few SaaS blog posts are well optimized for conversions.
We have a separate resource detailing our approach to B2B SaaS blog design, but the main elements of optimizing a blog post for conversions include:

Minimizing the header to guide the user journey to high value resources.
Adding last updated dates to signal content freshness for search engines and visitors.
Simplifying the sidebar menu with jump links for a clean user experience.
Internally linking to product pages, use cases, and gated offers to increase website engagement.
Driving action with “What you should do now?” next steps

This approach removes distractions from the blog posts while clearly pointing the reader towards the next step of the buyer journey and is therefore a highly effective method for increasing blog post conversions.
Additional Pages

Here, we’ll discuss a collection of additional pages that most SaaS marketing sites have: integrations, resources, support, and contact pages.
The first decision to make is placement of these pages on the website.
We typically make these decisions on a case by case basis, but as a rule of thumb, we don’t want to clutter the main navigation.
Therefore, we often recommend to our clients to include Support pages, and even sometimes the Resource pages, in the second-tier structure on their websites.
However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule. For example, if the product is very developer focused, it might make sense to have resources and support documents readily available in the main header. In contrast, if the product is typically purchased by and for non-technical stakeholders, it likely makes sense to place these pages in the footer.
The same logic applies to the Integrations pages.
In most cases, we’ll place the Integrations page in the website’s footer, but if the software depends heavily on other integrations, it might make sense to add it to the header.
For example, Everhour (see below) is a time tracking software that needs to be plugged into a project management tool — so integrations are a key selling point:

Now that we’ve discussed where to place these pages on your website, let’s discuss how we approach structuring them.
Integrations
First, your integrations page(s) should target the technology’s keywords with your content, even if your solution doesn’t yet integrate with a particular tool. If it’s on the roadmap, get it onto the site with a “coming soon” or “do you need this integration? Let us know…” message.
The danger of not doing this is that a tool like Zapier will get a handle on these keywords. You’ll miss out on traffic, and as a result you’ll lose the opportunity to easily remarket to people on your landing page.
For example:

Resources
I’ve seen a lot of SaaS companies produce new resources without considering where the gaps are in their funnel. In the Resources section of the Authority SaaS Website Design Map, we have 11 different content types, split between awareness stages: Problem Unaware, Problem Aware, and Solution Aware.
The role of the resources in this section is to move people from Problem Unaware to Solution Aware.
Marketers think “if a webinar went okay last year — why not do another one?”, but this is haphazard and not strategic enough. Instead, we use a methodical approach for planning SaaS marketing resources, using a traffic light system to figure out what works and what doesn’t:

If you’ve never done webinars, that’s a red.
If you’ve done webinars and they went okay, that’s a yellow.
If you’ve nailed webinars and they successfully generate leads on a consistent basis, that’s a green.

We do this for every resource, and by the end of the exercise it’s clear which areas need improvement.
Next, we work backwards through the list to improve resources from the bottom of the funnel to the top. In other words, we start with double down on greens (resources that have been proven to work) and optimize them or find ways to get more demo requests or signups from them, before moving to yellows and reds. Note that this is contrarian to most growth hacking lore, which focuses on how to get more traffic, rather than converting the traffic a company already gets.

The footer is also a useful place to host content about competitors and alternatives. Whether you like it or not, your prospects will be surfing around and comparing solutions. These pages should be designed to rank organically for keyword terms — to make sure you have your say in the conversation.

						Is updating your website really going to meaningfully boost conversions?
Many marketers don’t know when they should invest in a website redesign as it can often seem like a vanity cost.
Instead of just hoping that rearchitecting the website magically drives more demo signups, we first identify if the company is experiencing any of the following three pain points, as a website redesign may be a viable solution to solving those problems and increasing conversions:

The website is underperforming: There are multiple reasons why your website might not receive enough traffic or visibility, but a poor website architecture is certainly one potential cause. If search engines can’t intuitively crawl the website, it probably won’t rank. Confusing navigation can also frustrate users and harm demo signup conversion rates.
The “look and feel” is noticeably dated in comparison to competitors: The brand design is a prospect’s first impression of the company. Unfortunately, if a competitor’s website design is noticeably better than your brand’s design, that competitor will automatically have an edge before the prospect even begins the buyer journey.
The website is difficult for marketing stakeholders to maintain: Some websites are built by developers for developers, meaning that it isn’t easy for non-technical people (like marketing stakeholders) to quickly make important changes and adjustments. This slows growth by creating project bottlenecks as marketers can’t immediately implement necessary changes.

If you’re experiencing any of the above three issues mentioned above, a website redesign may be the best solution to improve performance.
However, simply changing the design and feel of the website won’t magically increase conversions. Instead, you must identify the user experience issues costing conversions and then adjust the website accordingly.
Identifying these issues and diagnosing them can be tricky, so we created the authority architecture framework. It’s a proven SaaS website architecture framework that consistently turns mediocre SaaS websites into demand generation machines that attract, engage, and convert your ideal customers. In this post, we’ll explain:

Why the traditional approach to building and architecting a SaaS website is ineffective.
How our authority architecture framework works and why it consistently delivers results.
Real results we’ve produced by using the authority architecture framework.

Why The Traditional Approach To Building a B2B SaaS Website is Flawed
The process of designing a SaaS website usually goes a little like this:

Collect random inspiration from other SaaS websites for a mood board
Ask product, engineering, customer service, and sales teams what they need
Design the website by committee

As a result, the website probably looks visually identical to thousands of other SaaS sites (pastel colors, vectors, etc.) who have also Googled ‘SaaS website design tips,’ making your brand immediately appear undifferentiated.

This is a problem, because not everyone visiting your website is ready to schedule a demo. For some people, the next step in the user journey may be learning about how the product works while others may need to learn why your product is better or different from competing products.
So if a CTA to schedule a demo is the only clear next step on the website, you’ll likely permanently lose all of the other prospects in earlier stages of the customer journey.
Additionally, every prospect starts the customer journey by educating themselves on how the product solves their pain points. If that information isn’t clearly available and they aren’t able to progress to the next step of the customer journey, you won’t have any late stage prospects coming to your website that are ready to schedule a demo.
Two different customer journeys for a SaaS product
As a result, you probably won’t receive any demo signups. Or, if you do receive some signups, they probably aren’t qualified prospects, meaning the website still probably won’t generate paying customers.
In addition, if the information on your website isn’t organized in an orderly fashion, it will also be difficult for search engines to crawl the website, which can negatively impact search engine rankings.
The Solution – B2B SaaS Authority Architecture Framework
In response, we’ve created the Authority Architecture — a practical site map that we’ve used to produce high converting SaaS websites for dozens of clients.
Unlike the traditional methods of constructing a SaaS website, the first step of the authority architecture framework is considering the various stages of the customer journey. Then, we structure the website to accommodate the main user journeys. As a result, the website is not only unique from other SaaS websites, but it also is highly effective at moving users through the buyer process and ultimately drives conversions.
This visual framework is designed to show SaaS companies how to structure their site, but also helps marketers see where content and resources should be strategically placed.

Results We’ve Produced Using The Authority Architecture Framework
Before showing the step by step process of executing the Authority Architecture framework, here are a few results we’ve produced by using it on our own clients.
One SaaS client we implemented it on in early 2022 experienced a strong increase in organic-sourced leads quarter-over-quarter:

We also implemented it for an enterprise relationship management SaaS, and it helped them achieve a near-immediate 4x increase in non-branded organic impressions.

Another one of our clients, a SaaS in the field service industry, was running an outdated website that required significant developer maintenance and drove minimal visitor engagement.
We deployed our B2B SaaS Authority Architecture in early 2021 to completely overhaul their website experience and installed a clean CMS that the marketing team could use daily without involving the web team.
Here are the year-over-year results these changes helped them achieve:

2x demos from organic search
186% increase in organic traffic
800% increase in organic impressions

How We Deploy The Authority Architecture Framework
At Powered By Search, we think in terms of attention, connection, and conversion. In this article, we’ll go through each section of this Authority SaaS Website Design Map, with screenshots, and focus on how to build a connection by using SaaS website best practices to speak to prospects in a way that will make a lasting first impression.

Homepage

We all know the basics of a SaaS homepage: a compelling headline, an eye-catching product hero shot (or explainer video clip), an obvious demo or free trial Call-to-Action (CTA), along with a clean user interface — focusing on providing a simple user experience. And most SaaS companies also know about the impact of social proof elements — such as testimonials and customer logos.
These are standard best practices and key design elements that build trust and convert visitors.
However, we often find that many SaaS website homepage designs are poorly optimized for doing the one thing that really matters – transforming an anonymous website visitor into a known prospect.
Specifically, most SaaS homepages are very vague in an attempt to not turn off any potential customers, but it actually has the opposite effect. Instead of igniting curiosity, many visitors are simply confused about what the product is and how it will help them solve their problems, so they simply leave the website.
Another common mistake is that the homepage tries to accomplish too many things at once. For example, if you’re trying to accommodate each customer journey, you might end up overloading the user with too much information, which turns them off and causes them to leave.
While this is a well-intentioned mistake, there’s a better method to accommodate the different user journeys without overloading the prospect.
To solve these problems, here’s the Homepage formula we use:

Headlines: We turn declarative statements into a question-based value proposition that answers “Why should I choose you over your competition?”
Lead Magnet CTA: Offering a lead magnet on your home page guides top and middle funnel visitors further down the funnel.
Value Propositions: Home page copy that talks about the benefits of your product and the pain points it alleviates.
Pillar Blog Posts: Internal links to top content that targets each stage of the funnel so no visitor is left unsure of the next step to take.
Enhanced Visuals: Showcasing your actual product in action, and not generic stock images

We’ll expand on these in more detail below.
Headlines
Many headlines are declarative statements that fail to communicate the value proposition of the company or touch on a key pain point the product solves. For example, a tagline like “Changing the world one entrepreneur at a time” doesn’t really tell you what the company does.
If the visitor doesn’t immediately understand what your product does or how it solves their problems, they’ll likely leave.
Another issue is that the tagline doesn’t communicate how you’re different from the competition.
For example, any CRM solution could have the tagline “All-in-One Customer Relationship Management.”
While this tagline clearly communicates that it’s a CRM platform, it doesn’t communicate the pain point it solves and how it is different from other CRMs.
So instead, we construct headlines by asking the following questions:

What does the product do and what’s the main pain point it solves?
How is it different from other competitors?

If you’re selling an enterprise CRM, a better tagline might be something like, “Are your enterprise leads going cold?”
This taps into a clear pain point that someone shopping for an enterprise CRM might experience.
Once we have the reader’s attention, we’ll dive deeper into the pain point below the headline to keep their attention. For example, we might mention something like, “Buyer cycles for enterprise companies are usually 6-9 months minimum, and a key reason why most leads go cold is because you don’t have a way to efficiently track leads and follow-up with them in a timely manner.”
Once the prospect understands that you can solve their problem and they can see how you’re different from the competition, they’ll be intrigued enough that you can direct them to the next step of the buyer journey.
Lead Magnet CTA
For many SaaS companies, creating a homepage lead magnet CTA is an afterthought. They miss the opportunity to educate people or provide added value to prospects who are in the middle of the funnel.
If your SaaS product is relatively low Annual Contract Value (ACV) — say, circa $1200 — you should showcase a free usable template or toolkit in your lead magnet Call-to-Action (CTA). This is a functional and valuable offer. It’s not quite the software, but it gives a preview for the real benefits the person will experience once they’ve signed up to a free trial or demo.
For higher ACV SaaS products — say, $50,000 or more — the buying decision is more complex. In this context, the lead magnet CTA should provide detailed pre-purchase education. This could be a “State of the Industry” report, a playbook for integrations, or a comparison between enterprise-level solutions.

Value Props: Pros Without Cons
We got this idea from Conversion Rate Experts, who talk about writing value propositions to talk about a benefit and the pain point the benefit alleviates — but worded in a way in which both are positive.
So, for example, a chatbot or support automation software might say something like:
“Resolve complaints in minutes, without having to hire a customer service team.”
The “resolve complaints in minutes” is the benefit, and the “without having to hire a customer service team” is the pain point that it resolves. This is a concise alternative to focusing on the pain point negatively, for example “it’s an expensive hassle to hire and train a customer service team, but…”.
SaaS product marketers often want to bury the pain points and instead highlight the benefits of the solution. However, highlighting the pain point is actually a great way to create deeper connections with website visitors and earn their trust.
Pillar Blog Posts
Many SaaS companies list the most recent blog posts on their homepage.
However, the homepage real estate is the most precious and the blog posts on it tend to generate the most traffic. So we take advantage of this by always listing the best performing blog posts (those that drive the most engagement, demos signups, or lead magnet downloads) on the homepage.
Alternatively, you can feed in your best three blog posts that target each stage of the funnel — top, middle, and bottom.
Each one of these will provide a unique journey for the prospect.
For example, a top-of-funnel blog post could feature a story of a customer solving problems that you know many of your prospects face — which can help visitors that need to become problem-aware. A bottom-of-funnel blog post could be one that discusses your pricing, or compares your product to a competitor.
How It Works

If a prospect visits the How it Works page, they’re interested in the logistics of the solution.
In an effort to hide critical product details from competitors, many SaaS companies talk about the product on a vague high level and hide the most compelling details of how the software works for the demo.
The problem with locking the most critical information behind the demo signup gate — plus requiring the prospect to turn up and watch it — is that most prospects will just leave and purchase from a competitor that does clearly state how the product works and how it will solve their problems.
You can’t really blame prospects – if one brand shows them exactly how they can solve their problem, why would that prospect go to the trouble of signing up for a demo with a brand that may or may not be able to solve their problem?
To give prospects the details they need to make an informed decision, we believe the most important elements of How it Works are the Feature & Benefit pages and the Use Case pages.
So, let’s dig into how the best SaaS companies can get these elements right.
Feature & Benefit Pages
An effective Feature & Benefit page (a Product Page) for a B2B SaaS website needs to address 4 key questions:

Does the product match what the visitors are searching for?
Can it do what they need and solve their problems?
Would purchasing this product be a worthwhile investment?
And finally, what should they do next?

As we mentioned in the How It Works section, many SaaS websites keep the information on the dedicated feature and product overview pages shallow in an effort to conceal key information from competitors.
For example, there might be a generic screenshot of the product and a high level overview of how it works, but as a result, prospects don’t actually understand what it does.

Instead, you want to create a B2B SaaS product page that answers the questions of every person at each stage of the buyer journey.
Therefore, here’s the basic framework we use:

Point 1: State The Feature
Point 2: Pain Point Question
Point 3: Benefit of Using The Feature
Point 4: Proof to Support Benefit Claim


To help you visualize this concept, let’s assume we’re talking about a web-based accounting software. In this case, the Feature & Benefit pages should be structured as follows:

Feature: “Send invoices effortlessly!”
Pain Point Question: “Are you wasting time by sending invoices manually?”
Benefit: “Get paid faster, without having to chase clients every week.”
Proof: A customer story or testimonial that supports your benefit claim. “I used to spend hours each month manually sending invoices. Sometimes I would get busy and send them late or forget to send them altogether. Now that I use (brand name), it only takes me a few minutes per month to send invoices and I’m always paid on time.”

Here’s why we recommend this structure:
Firstly, point #1 (Feature) and #2 (Pain Point Question) pair the feature with the pain point it solves. This lets you talk about a feature in the context of its benefit and will resonate with the prospect who has a pain point.
Point #3 (Benefit) hits the “pro without con” line, doubling down on the pain point. Finally, point #4 gives credibility and backup to show how the product has been practically applied, with great results.
To help you visualize this structure in action, here’s an example we did for a client.
It starts with the feature; An API protection solution that just works.
Then, it discusses the pain point; Most API security starts with a complex product that requires headcount to manage. The next paragraph introduces how the solution solves that problem and provides more details on the feature itself.

 
As you scroll down, you’ll see that the customer testimonial supports the claims made above (that ThreatX makes it super easy to identify and block API attacks).
Finally, we drive it home with a “pro without con” style benefit. In this case, the pro is detecting and blocking threats in the APIs, and the “without con” is that your team doesn’t need another tool to manage.

 
Note: A lot of SaaS clients come to us and say they don’t have a customer testimonial like this. If that’s the case for you, write one and find an existing customer that matches. Actually go to them and ask if they’re willing to write a similar testimonial or stand behind this one, tweaking it to however it applies to them. Don’t wait for it — look at your customers and find a quote that matches the story you want to tell. Honesty in the testimonial is paramount.
Use Cases
Often, the fastest way to quickly communicate how something works and its value is by giving an example of it in action.
This is the job of the use case page.
For example, let’s say you have a membership management software (like our friends at Wild Apricot). Users are typically teachers, local associations, little leagues, and community groups. They often start in Excel, but as their membership database grows, the document keeps crashing. This is a real and acute pain point.
In this scenario, one Use Case would tell the story of how Wild Apricot has eased the pain for real customers by giving them a reliable, smooth, and fast way to manage members. It would talk about how Excel would crash at inopportune times, and show how this messed up operations. SaaS to the rescue!
Use Case pages expand on the information in Feature & Benefit pages — which usually don’t have space for such a detailed story. They also tap into the Who It’s For section of the website — which is something we discuss in the next part of this article.
Loom’s Use Case Pages
Who It’s For (i.e. Not Just Solutions or Verticals Pages)

Many SaaS websites build pages that address the solution it provides or a particular vertical it serves (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.).
However, addressing a single vertical is insufficient because there are typically multiple different people involved in the buyer journey for an enterprise B2B SaaS product, and ignoring one or multiple avatars involved in the purchase process can cost you a conversion.
For example, if the person who will use the product understands how it will make their life easier, but the stakeholder signing off doesn’t understand how it will make the company more money, the sale might fall through.
To solve this problem, we ensure each “who it’s for” page speaks to a specific buyer persona (e.g., the specific role or job title) involved in the purchase process.
Here’s a great example from one of our clients, Pabau.
You can see that we have “Who Its For” pages by role (practice owners, practice managers, treatment providers, etc.) as each of them will use the product differently and receive different benefits from it.

 
For example on the page for practice owners, we show how the product will help them drive more revenue (reducing no-shows, improving online booking conversions, etc.), as revenue is what they care about the most.

 
In contrast, the page for marketers shows how the product will make them more efficient by automating tasks and provide the data they need to improve their marketing strategy.

 
There is also a “Who Its For” page by industry (e.g., medi-aesthetic, cosmetic surgeries, etc.) so that each industry can see how the product will aid their specific use case.
How Is Who It’s For Different from Features and Use Cases?
These pages are different because they are explicitly geared towards a particular individual persona. There’s no subtlety — just obvious examples of how the software positively impacts their job.
This is the key thing to remember: we often use the same stories, features, and use cases as on other pages, but the information is angled more precisely to an individual. In my opinion, most SaaS websites are too paranoid about repeating the same content in various areas. On the contrary, we believe that you should double-down on the most compelling stories, and apply them in ways that make sense for each area of the site. If you look at what we include in the Feature & Benefit pages, the Use Cases, and the Who It’s For section of a website, you’ll see a lot of overlap. This is purposeful.
It’s not about only using one message once. Instead, you should be shaping your value proposition in different ways, with a different emphasis for different pages. It’s website personalization without the tech.

The Remarketing Benefits of Who It’s For
The Who It’s For section can also power your remarketing engine, because you can target specific audiences after they’ve been on the site.
When they hit one of the avatar pages — and/or spend a certain amount of time on a page, you can retarget them with relevant pain point focused content in their feed. We call this strategy the Boomerang Method and discuss it in more detail in our remarketing guide.
This can also be applied to the Use Cases — where you can glean that a user is particularly interested in a certain application of the SaaS product to solve a certain problem.
Pricing Page

All SaaS websites should feature information about pricing, whether it is explicit in dollars or not. For higher level enterprise SaaS products, it’s often not even possible to give numbers due to the complexity of custom integrations. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t have a pricing page.
The workaround might be something to pre-qualify prospects, like:
“We don’t have standardized pricing options, but we might be a good fit for you if you have a growth team of more than ten people and you’ve already invested in [Expensive Solution X] or [Expensive Solution Y].”
This sends an implicit message that your SaaS product is geared towards bigger teams and hefty budgets.
However, for most lower-ACV SaaS companies, we recommend the standard 3-tier pricing structure. And without exception, in our opinion every SaaS pricing table should include a non-priced “Enterprise” (or similar) field. This can simply lead to a contact form to get in touch with your sales team.
Someone who fills this out is signaling that they want to “fly business class” — and that they couldn’t possibly take their boss an invoice for $99. By not having this option, you might be missing out on revenue, or you might even dissuade the highest-tier potential customers from signing up.
Finally, if possible, you should show how your pricing compares to competitors. Basecamp does this better than any other SaaS product I’ve seen:

 
Why Us & Origin Story

Next up in the SaaS website architecture: Why Us and Origin Story.
This is where you pitch your brand as something more than just a software product. A lot of SaaS companies get blinded by the black and white of wanting conversions, and they get obsessed with selling the product’s value proposition. They don’t invest a lot of time or energy in these “softer” parts of the website.
But a lot of buyers are looking for more. They want to understand the culture behind the organization, the commitment to social responsibility, and the bigger long-term mission.
Remember: the customer is entering into a subscription model, so they’ll be interacting with your brand on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. They need to know what you stand for — because you’re becoming a colleague.

Blog

Blog pages can quickly become the most trafficked webpages of a B2B SaaS website, but few SaaS blog posts are well optimized for conversions.
We have a separate resource detailing our approach to B2B SaaS blog design, but the main elements of optimizing a blog post for conversions include:

Minimizing the header to guide the user journey to high value resources.
Adding last updated dates to signal content freshness for search engines and visitors.
Simplifying the sidebar menu with jump links for a clean user experience.
Internally linking to product pages, use cases, and gated offers to increase website engagement.
Driving action with “What you should do now?” next steps

This approach removes distractions from the blog posts while clearly pointing the reader towards the next step of the buyer journey and is therefore a highly effective method for increasing blog post conversions.
Additional Pages

Here, we’ll discuss a collection of additional pages that most SaaS marketing sites have: integrations, resources, support, and contact pages.
The first decision to make is placement of these pages on the website.
We typically make these decisions on a case by case basis, but as a rule of thumb, we don’t want to clutter the main navigation.
Therefore, we often recommend to our clients to include Support pages, and even sometimes the Resource pages, in the second-tier structure on their websites.
However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule. For example, if the product is very developer focused, it might make sense to have resources and support documents readily available in the main header. In contrast, if the product is typically purchased by and for non-technical stakeholders, it likely makes sense to place these pages in the footer.
The same logic applies to the Integrations pages.
In most cases, we’ll place the Integrations page in the website’s footer, but if the software depends heavily on other integrations, it might make sense to add it to the header.
For example, Everhour (see below) is a time tracking software that needs to be plugged into a project management tool — so integrations are a key selling point:

Now that we’ve discussed where to place these pages on your website, let’s discuss how we approach structuring them.
Integrations
First, your integrations page(s) should target the technology’s keywords with your content, even if your solution doesn’t yet integrate with a particular tool. If it’s on the roadmap, get it onto the site with a “coming soon” or “do you need this integration? Let us know…” message.
The danger of not doing this is that a tool like Zapier will get a handle on these keywords. You’ll miss out on traffic, and as a result you’ll lose the opportunity to easily remarket to people on your landing page.
For example:

Resources
I’ve seen a lot of SaaS companies produce new resources without considering where the gaps are in their funnel. In the Resources section of the Authority SaaS Website Design Map, we have 11 different content types, split between awareness stages: Problem Unaware, Problem Aware, and Solution Aware.
The role of the resources in this section is to move people from Problem Unaware to Solution Aware.
Marketers think “if a webinar went okay last year — why not do another one?”, but this is haphazard and not strategic enough. Instead, we use a methodical approach for planning SaaS marketing resources, using a traffic light system to figure out what works and what doesn’t:

If you’ve never done webinars, that’s a red.
If you’ve done webinars and they went okay, that’s a yellow.
If you’ve nailed webinars and they successfully generate leads on a consistent basis, that’s a green.

We do this for every resource, and by the end of the exercise it’s clear which areas need improvement.
Next, we work backwards through the list to improve resources from the bottom of the funnel to the top. In other words, we start with double down on greens (resources that have been proven to work) and optimize them or find ways to get more demo requests or signups from them, before moving to yellows and reds. Note that this is contrarian to most growth hacking lore, which focuses on how to get more traffic, rather than converting the traffic a company already gets.
Footer

Don’t miss an opportunity with the 404 Error Page. Can you direct them to an avatar page, or can you identify their pain points and/or motivations in another way?

The footer is also a useful place to host content about competitors and alternatives. Whether you like it or not, your prospects will be surfing around and comparing solutions. These pages should be designed to rank organically for keyword terms — to make sure you have your say in the conversation.

																										HubSpot RevOps Agency for B2B SaaS: Bridge the Gap Between Marketing & Sales

									Reduce Data Leakage

								
							
							
															The worst part of trying to join RevOps data that’s scattered between multiple tools, spreadsheets, and integrations is not how complex it can get.
Instead, it’s the unavoidable feeling of doubt that your hard earned marketing and sales data is being lost or fragmented along the way and you won’t notice until it drags down revenue.

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
						
						
						
						

						

							
							
								
									Simplify Attribution

								
							
							
															Struggling to draw a path from marketing and sales activities to revenue outcomes when you don’t have a clean and centralized rev ops platform is an exercise in frustration.
When your B2B buyer journeys are long and winding it can look like an unsolvable maze if your marketing & sales pipeline is disjointed from your bottom line.
 

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
						
						
						
						

						

							
							
								
									Stop Wasting Time

								
							
							
															Let’s face it, trying to piece together disparate RevOps data from multiple sources is a huge waste of time.
If you’re spending endless hours trying to connect marketing and sales data to revenue growth, it’s costing you valuable time that’s better spent on earning and retaining more customers.

		Our Origin StoryA note from our founder: Dev Basu
Dear friend,
This week I picked up a copy of Strategy Magazine. In it, I found agencies of various shapes and sizes, all nominated for an Agency of The Year award in the areas of creative, digital, media, and design excellence. Out of curiosity, I visited each of their websites and was shocked to see that these cutting-edge agencies only spoke about “them”.
I find that odd because when you’re in the business of helping other companies succeed with marketing and sales, wouldn’t it make more sense to talk about “you” — the client?
When I left an agency in 2009, I never thought I’d actually end up starting another one. I thought and still think that most agencies are Mad Men-esque outfits, billing you by the hour at exorbitant rates, cramming rooms full of interns and other people who don’t need to be there.
As our team at Powered by Search grew, I heard war stories from our incoming team — late hours, over-worked people, fudged models and projections, and presentations that were still being worked on minutes before the client walked into the office.
When the ‘go to market strategy’ is resting on is your last award, it’s not surprising that great talent still doesn’t produce the dream results, that you, the client seeks.
While working with Fortune 1000 and entrepreneurial companies since 2006, I noticed a trend — all our clients had talented people and abundant technology, but they lacked a system for being able to predictably and reliably generate results.
I figured that if we created a system that generated the right results every single time, talented people working with powerful technology could be integrated into a system that produces predictable growth.
That’s exactly what we’ve done at Powered by Search to help our clients win. We start by understanding you and your customer, pinpointing their fears, frustrations, wants and aspirations, and bring your message to millions.
So you’re probably wondering, is Powered by Search worth my time and attention? For many readers, the answer is NO.
Here are Are 3 Reasons Why
If You Don’t Advertise or Create Content, We Can’t Help You
If you don’t want to advertise, you’re not going to enjoy our stuff. There’s lots of content about the “latest loopholes to get free traffic” or “gaming the system with this one-little-known growth hack”.
Does some of it work? Probably. In the short term. But if you rely on that, you don’t have a sustainable business.
Does that mean SEO doesn’t work? Hell no. Today, it drives over $2.36 Billion in revenue for our clients.
We Don’t Sell Vanity, Eyeballs, Impressions or Hype
Viral marketing campaigns are great, but they have short lifespans, and attributing sales is difficult. Adding cute stickers to 15 seconds videos is fun, but it doesn’t build businesses. A great product marketed well does.
We Only Work With Long-Term Thinkers Who Have Great Products and Solutions
Look, if you want to become the brand that becomes the only choice for your ideal customers it takes hard work.
Our best clients are invested in the long-term success of their own businesses, and the long-term success of their customers.
Sure, you can hire us for a project and see an impact in 90 days or less, but if that’s all you’re looking for, we probably aren’t the right fit. Like compound interest, our clients see massive ROI (1000+% gains) by being open-minded, action takers who play the long game.
You’re still here? Great.
What You Can Expect From Us

Practical solutions, strategies and tactics you can use in your digital marketing right now, for free…followed by
Invitations to explore if and how we can help you achieve the results you want faster, by diagnosing symptoms and problems and removing the roadblocks that stand in the way of you getting to the next level.
Objective insight on your situation, regardless of whether we work together or not.

How Do I Know If You’re Any Good?
The best way to know if you’ll like our perspective is to get some of our free materials.
If you like them, you’ll probably like working with us.
One of our core values is “being obsessed with serving others”, and the way we deliver on that in our content is to make sure we’re genuinely helping you before you ever talk to us.
Here’s Our First Pitch To You
Whenever you’re ready, here are 3 ways we can help you get more attention, more connection, and more conversion so that you can grow your business:
Get Your SaaS Scalability Score
We created this free self-assessment tool to help you identify exactly how your B2B SaaS company stacks up against your competitors in the market across 9 different revenue accelerators.
Get the Agency Evaluation Guide
Figuring out which digital marketing agency will be the best fit your company can be really difficult if you do not have a system for doing it.  That’s why we created a guide that helps you evaluate your current agency, and find a great new partner too.
Work with Us Privately
And if you ever want to get some 1:1 help, we can jump on the phone for a quick call, and brainstorm how to get you more leads, more sales, and more ROI.

									Deep understanding of developer business models

								
							
							
															We only work with B2B SaaS and many of our clients are developer focused. It’s common to hear people say that marketing doesn’t work on developers. Our results show that that’s wrong.
Here’s a couple results for developer focused companies:

6.2% growth in keywords appearing in search
8.63% new users organic traffic growth
+32% conversions from Google Ads
+73% conversions from Bing Ads


							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															The 80/20 of SaaS marketing
							
							
								
									Pareto marketing: Get marketing strategy that delivers the most efficient results.

								
							
							
															80% of the results come from 20% of the work. There’s a heap you could do to grow your company – and other agencies seem to be obsessed with it but we focus on the activities that move the needle fastest.
Once the results start coming in, we can look at the next 20% of actions. We drive results, not activity.

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															No lengthy audits, no waiting
							
							
								
									Avoid lengthy audits. Get straight into the work.

								
							
							
															Clients frequently come to us frustrated that they’ve had to wait months to see any kind of ROI. Most of their time has been spent working through lengthy SEO or ad account audits and all they have to show is a long list of recommendations.
We work differently to that. From Day 1, we’re in your accounts:

Finding ways to cut inefficient ad spend
Fixing problems with your search performance
Identifying high value conversion rate changes

Find out more about how our onboarding process works

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															Real time reporting
							
							
								
									You shouldn’t have to ask to see your results. See real time reports on your marketing ROI.

								
							
							
															As well as a regular cadence of synchronous and asynchronous reporting, we create every client we work with a set of dashboards so that there’s never any question about the cold, hard numbers:

How much of our ad budget has been spent this month?
How are we pacing against new trial targets?
How many conversions came through organic search this week?


							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
					
					
					

						
													
						
						
						
						

						

															Transparent communication
							
							
								
									Async communication gives everyone time for deep work

								
							
							
															Quality marketing results require time, thought and effort.
We work async, give our team time to focus on deep work and make sure that they have time to write thoughtful, clear responses to questions that you have about your marketing investment.

						Choosing a B2B SaaS marketing agency is tricky because, on the surface, they all seem similar.
So when you Google “best SaaS marketing agencies” and see a list of 20 or 28 different options, how do you distinguish a world-class SaaS Marketing agency from a mediocre one?
Unfortunately, most clients don’t figure out the answer to this question until after hiring an agency and wasting thousands of dollars – not to mention all the missed sales opportunities a more effective agency could have helped you win.
To help you avoid hiring the wrong agency, here’s what we’ll cover:

How most clients evaluate SaaS marketing agencies (and why the method is flawed)
An alternative agency evaluation method that can help you better gauge an agency’s ability to produce an ROI
A concise list of top SaaS marketing agencies and a detailed overview of how they measure up to the evaluation criteria.


The 28 best B2B SaaS marketing agencies we reviewed
While we’ll go into a lot of detail below about why each of these agencies is on our list and when you might want to hire each of them, for your ease, here are the top 28 SaaS marketing agencies and consultants:

Why Traditional SaaS Marketing Agency Evaluation Methods Are Flawed
Most traditional agency evaluation advice includes:

Analyzing case studies
Years of experience
Pricing

However, we’ve found that most clients using these criteria as the main decision framework have a history of receiving disappointing results and switching agencies frequently.
Below, we’ll discuss the flaws with each evaluation principle and then provide a more effective evaluation criterion.
1. Analyzing case studies
Most agencies (even mediocre providers) can show you a handful of great case studies, but that doesn’t mean they can predictably duplicate those results for your company.
Why?
Clients with great products/services can grow organically without marketing. So, the agency itself might not have caused the company’s growth.
Secondly, the law of averages says that some marketing campaigns will be lucky and go well. Even if the agency shows you five successful campaigns, they might have run 50 campaigns to get those five winners.
So, case studies don’t always accurately reflect the agency’s average results – only their best results.
2. Years of experience
Most people think that marketing agencies with more experience produce better results.
While you certainly don’t want to hire an agency with no experience, there’s rarely a direct correlation between ROI and the number of years an agency has been in business.
This is true for a few reasons.
First, many mediocre agencies stay in business because they’re excellent at lead generation. So even if dissatisfied clients churn, they can always generate more leads and stay in business.
Additionally, marketing is constantly evolving, and agencies need to adjust their strategies accordingly to continue delivering a strong ROI.
If one of the key selling points the agency pitches is its years of marketing experience, it could be a red flag that they use dated marketing practices.
3. Pricing
Many clients mistakenly judge the cost of hiring an agency based on price rather than ROI.
Choosing a cheaper agency that produces mediocre results is often more expensive than hiring a premium agency that produces better results.
This is especially true as many phantom costs involve hiring a low-performing agency, like time and resources devoted to onboarding.
You can use the three criteria above to narrow the list of agencies you talk to, though we recommend against using it to make your final decision.
A More Effective SaaS Marketing Evaluation Criterion
From watching the broader SaaS marketing agency industry and our own experience partnering with over 100 B2B SaaS companies, we’ve found some common themes among the most successful client/agency relationships.
Specifically, client/agency relationships that have mutual trust, last the longest, and are highly productive in terms of results and growth tend to:

Implement proven processes – The agency has implemented a similar process with steady success across other similar SaaS companies at similar growth stages.
Specialize in a specific type of client – The agency only works with a particular kind of company (i.e., B2B enterprise SaaS) at a specific growth stage (i.e., $10-100M ARR).
Prioritize internal team strength and health – As an agency is a service-based business, the people are one of the most significant that impact ROI. So, agencies prioritizing hiring and retaining outstanding talent tend to deliver better results.

As you can see, these three criteria are much more specific, making them more effective at distinguishing outstanding agencies from mediocre ones. We’ll discuss them in more detail below.
1. Do they have a proven process for marketing SaaS companies like yours?
We discussed that most marketing agencies can show prospects a handful of successful case studies, but that doesn’t mean they can consistently produce those results.
Processes eliminate many variables that cause inconsistent results, so agencies with proven processes tend to deliver better results.
During the evaluation process, ask them to transparently lay out their process and walk you through how they executed it in each case study. If they don’t have a proven process or say they offer different custom-tailored solutions for each company, that’s a red flag.
Sure, you want to make sure that they can adjust to the nuances of your business, but if they’re starting from scratch every time, they’ll have to test a lot more variables (channels, messages, etc.), which costs you money and increases the timeline to see an ROI.
2. Do they specialize in B2B SaaS?
If an agency works with SaaS companies, e-commerce companies, and service businesses, they probably apply a “one-size-fits-all” marketing approach to all their clients.
A one-size-fits-all agency might drive some results, but it probably won’t drive the best results as the process isn’t designed for the nuances of your customer’s journey, and the employees in the agency probably don’t specialize in SaaS marketing.
So, to make the most of your marketing investment, we recommend you hire expert consultants as you grow (we’ll introduce you to some below) and only hire an agency when you have the budget to work with a B2B SaaS specialist.
3. How healthy and happy is their internal team, and how is it structured?
Service-based businesses are notoriously tricky to hire because your ROI depends largely on the people executing the process.
So, how do you evaluate an agency’s internal team health?
First, you can look at employee churn and tenure on LinkedIn.

If the talent working on your account constantly changes, you’ll inevitably lose some time, money, and ground on competitors as they learn the nuances of your business.
High churn also indicates that employees are dissatisfied. Unfortunately, unmotivated and unhappy people don’t perform at their best.
To further investigate employee happiness, look at the company’s Glassdoor reviews.
In addition to employee satisfaction, evaluate the experience level of the employees working on your account.
While this may seem tricky, a simple method to gauge employee skill level is to see how frequently an agency’s junior staff are promoted to VP and director-level roles (you can do this by looking at the employees’ LinkedIn profiles).
A high pace of juniors moving into leadership roles in a speedy manner indicates that you’ll be dealing with inexperienced leaders if you hire the company.
Most people consider only these 4 SaaS marketing agencies if they’re between $10M-100M annually recurring revenue
If you Google “best SaaS marketing agencies,” you’ll get an unsorted, under-critical list of agencies that the post’s author doesn’t really want you to consider and their own agency at the top of the list in the hopes that you choose them.
While we have also placed our own agency at the top of the list, we’ve explained the reasons for this and given in-depth views on why you might want to choose a different agency.
If you’d like to know how we think about competitor comparison pages, check out this guide
In reality, only four agencies are designed to generate demand for a B2B SaaS product of $10-100M. Of those four, two can serve $100M+ ARR businesses.
So, we’ll introduce you to these agencies and provide an overview of their marketing approach.
If you’re still at an early growth stage, the rest of this list provides an overview of several highly specialized SaaS individuals that can help you reach the next growth stage.
1. Powered By Search
Notable Clients: Freshbooks, Basecamp, Collibra, Varonis, Elastic, VMWare, and 150+ other B2B SaaS category leaders.
Typically, we aren’t the first marketing agency our clients have worked with, but they come to us because they want to solve one of the following problems:

“We can’t scale paid media profitably. Our CPA is rising. No agency has been able to fix this.”
“People are watching the webinar but don’t convert afterward.”
“We’re generating leads, but they aren’t turning into revenue when they get to sales.”
“Our product is great. But no one knows who we are. We feel like the best-kept secret in town.”

While it’s easy for marketing agencies to say they can solve these problems, we’ve built a proven system and strategy for B2B SaaS marketing (our Predictable Growth Model) that consistently solves them for our B2B SaaS clients.
Here’s how it works:
How The Predictable Growth Model helps B2B SaaS companies become unstoppable
We believe you’ll have an unstoppable SaaS business if you can accomplish these three things:

Increase in QPC (quality of pipeline certainty) – You’re consistently generating a steady quantity of high-quality leads.
Decrease in CAC (customer acquisition costs) – You can acquire customers for less money.
Increase in LTV (lifetime value) – Your ideal customers invest more with you and stay longer.

The Predictable Growth Model is based on these guiding principles and consists of three key elements: attract, engage, and convert.
 

You can read our predictable growth model methodology overview to learn about the intricate details of this strategy, though here’s a brief overview of the three key points.
Attract – Go from obscurity to dominance
Attraction is about ensuring you are getting the right people onto your website, with the right messages, and de-anonymizing them.
A key failure of many SaaS marketing systems is filling their pipelines with the wrong people. The downstream effects of getting poor fit traffic onto your website are broad and significant.
Your website is usually the first opportunity for a visitor to decide whether your product is right for them or not. If you get the wrong people onto your website, then you’re going to experience low conversion rates, and if you’re sending that traffic with an ‘expensive’ channel like LinkedIn Ads, then your campaign costs will soar.
On the other hand, by attracting the right people to your website and getting them into your funnel, you increase quality pipeline certainty (QPC) and because they’re the right fit prospects and you’re clear on your transformational promise to them, you will see increase lifetime value (LTV)
Engage – Eliminate friction in your conversion machine
Engagement is about leveraging the hard work done in attracting right-fit traffic, and combining it with educational content and calibrated calls-to-action to turn website visitors into prospects.
The primary goal of engagement is to increase quality pipeline certainty (QPC), which, as you’ll see in the next section on conversion, also helps reduce the customer acquisition cost (CAC) by improving conversion from anonymous visitor to ready to talk to sales.
To improve your QPC, we focus on pinpointing customer pain points, educating and motivating prospects, and calibrating calls to action. By doing so, more visitors will understand that your product is tailored to address their specific needs in ways that other products cannot.
Additionally, they will gain a clear understanding of the appropriate actions to take based on their stage in the buyer readiness journey.
Convert – Go from loose engagement to locked-in prospects
Conversion is about making sure that the customers you’re acquiring to stick around and pay you for long enough to make economic sense for your company.
Even with the best acquisition system in the world, if your customers churn at too high a rate then you’re throwing good money after bad. Businesses that are able to retain customers for a long period of time can usually afford to invest significantly more in their marketing because they know that they’ll get that investment back in subsequent years.
If you can decrease the cost of acquisition (CAC) while simultaneously increasing the lifetime value of customers (LTV) you are well on your way to building a great SaaS business.

How Powered By Search is Different
Plenty of marketing agencies execute aspects of this model (attract, engage, convert), but Powered By Search is the only agency that takes a holistic approach to marketing by fully addressing each of the attract, engage, and convert stages.
We’ve found that if you only execute one or two of these three stages, you might see some results, but you won’t be able to predictable decrease CAC and increase QPC and LTV.
To see how we’ve implemented this model across a variety of different companies, check out some of these SaaS marketing case studies:

How Powered by Search Helped iWave Achieve a 7-Figure Revenue Growth from Paid Media in Under a Year
How we helped Loopio increase demos by 41% quarter over quarter and achieve consistent growth
How We Helped PointClickCare Get Over 2000 Leads with LinkedIn Ads

Do They Specialize?
We work exclusively with B2B SaaS companies that sell to enterprise customers.
Unlike most SaaS marketing agencies, we’ve developed a proven process optimized to navigate the complexities of longer customer journeys and are familiar with the nuanced challenges you’re currently facing.
How is Internal Team Health?

We prioritize exclusively hiring senior level subject matter experts. So, instead of hiring account managers like traditional agencies do, we pay top dollar for the talent that’s actually executing your marketing strategy.
You can check out our LinkedIn profile to see our employees’ impressive backgrounds for yourself.
We also realize that the experts we’ve hired could find another job tomorrow, so we prioritize their well-being and cultivate a workplace they enjoy.
This strategy has worked out well. Looking at our Glassdoor reviews, you’ll see that the average team member has stayed with us for over two years.
This means you won’t have to build new relationships with new account managers every few months or worry about losing ground on competitors as new team members learn about your business.

2. Refine Labs
Refine Labs offers demand generation advisory and execution. They’ve shifted towards a community-driven growth model, introducing resources like the Vault and a process called Revenue R&D. However, it’s unclear how this benefits their clients in practice.
Refine Labs focuses on “demand creation” rather than demand generation, believing that most sales occur through conversations on platforms like LinkedIn and Slack (“dark social”). As these conversations are challenging to track, Refine Labs doesn’t use tracking tools like Google Analytics or Salesforce. Instead, they rely on self-reported attribution as their single source of truth, an approach we find flawed in our own article on the topic.
This methodology may present organizational and financial challenges when demonstrating ROI to your board and CFO. At Powered By Search, we believe that customer touchpoints mentioned in surveys are often just a part of the journey and could be subject to inaccuracies.
Additionally, top-of-the-funnel efforts, like podcasts, are awareness mediums, not lead acquisition channels. Attributing an entire conversion to a single medium, such as a podcast, is inaccurate.
As for their tactical approach to demand creation, Refine Labs lacks written documentation of their strategy. According to clients who previously worked with them, they typically recommend random acts of marketing, like starting a podcast or writing content. However, these strategies lack cohesion and optimization, taking an extended period to deliver ROI for your business.
Do They Specialize?
Refine Labs specializes in serving B2B companies, but not specifically B2B SaaS.
How is Internal Team Health?
They recently laid off about 40% of their staff, and the median employee tenure is just over a year.

 
Looking through their LinkedIn profile, you’ll notice they have a robust client management staff which puts middle management in between you and the people working on your marketing.
They have a 4.3 star rating on Glassdoor.

11. Kalungi
Founded in 2018, Kalungi is a full-service B2B SaaS marketing agency that specializes in helping early-stage software companies hit the ground running.
On the other hand, Powered by Search has been around since 2009 and has a proven process of using both paid and organic strategies to grow demo and trial-based SaaS and B2B technology businesses.
Working with Kalungi looks different for each company, depending on their needs. Typically, you can take one of two paths to achieve your business growth goals: get an entire marketing team on demand or bring in a dedicated CMO to guide your existing marketing team.
A full engagement with Kalungi involves three elements: marketing leadership, inbound marketing, and account-based marketing. For companies with an ARR of no more than $50 million, the CMO will guide the team anywhere between 8-18 months. Kalungi states that the benefit of outsourcing marketing leadership is that they can switch up the CMO as the needs of the company change over time.
Do They Specialize?
Yes, Kalungi specializes in early-stage B2B SaaS companies and guides them through their growth journey.
How is Internal Team Health?
Kalungi has an overall score of 4.3 on Glassdoor, with most reviews indicating the workplace culture is good. Teams are knowledgeable, management puts people first, and there are plenty of professional development opportunities.
12. Simple Tiger
Simple Tiger is a SaaS marketing agency that combines their own AI technology and a playbook of tactics that give fast results. They focus on SEO and PPC to drive traffic and revenue for clients.
Based on what you need, you can work with them in different ways: an hourly consulting format, a one-time SEO audit, or have them manage entire PPC campaigns.
The team at Simple Tiger will analyze your site health and competition before establishing a suitable strategy and roadmap for execution. They will do a deep keyword analysis to find all the low-hanging fruit or gaps that can be exploited, and then develop world-class content. Combine this with a quality link-building strategy, and that’s your SEO done.
Powered by Search offers many of the same services; however, we focus on demand generation and building sustainable growth instead of quick wins.
Do They Specialize?
They specialize in SaaS, but not strictly B2B SaaS, as they also work with B2C and Fintech clients.
How is Internal Team Health?
There’s nothing available online or on Glassdoor about Simple Tiger employee satisfaction. But according to their LinkedIn profile, they appear to have a stable team of employees with minimal turnover.
13. Skale
Skale is an SEO agency that helps SaaS companies grow and expand their reach. Their services, which include SEO management, link building, and content marketing, are focused not only on building organic traffic but also on driving tangible results like product signups, activations, and MRR.
If you team up with Skale, you’ll have access to an SEO strategist, content SEO specialist, tech SEO analyst, and an off-page SEO manager. These SEO experts will develop a 3-month plan of attack, complete extensive keyword research, and recommend page optimizations.
Just like Powered by Search, Skale also focuses on B2B SaaS clients; however, they don’t have the same level of experience with enterprise clients.
Do They Specialize?
Skale focuses solely on B2B SaaS clients.
How is Internal Team Health?
There are limited employee reviews available on Glassdoor, but they are all positive. In addition to that, Skale promotes itself as an ethical employer, taking into consideration work-life balance and their carbon footprint. It’s safe to say all is well at Skale.
14. Impactable
Impactable is a B2B marketing agency that focuses on LinkedIn Ads for high-growth startups.
With Justin Rowe as a founder, who is known as the world’s leading LinkedIn expert, you know you’re getting top-quality LinkedIn Ads services and advice here. Their focus on LinkedIn Ads is so strong that they’ve even built their own tools to manage ads and reporting.
They manage all avenues of LinkedIn Ads, including lead generation and targeting niche audiences, effective ad retargeting, and demand generation strategy development. Besides specializing in LinkedIn Ads, they also offer a Google Ads paid search management service.
Impactable doesn’t mention specific outcomes or results they’ve achieved for clients, which is certainly unhelpful when researching a SaaS marketing agency to work with. At Powered by Search, on the other hand, we are clear and upfront about the results we’ve helped our clients achieve and the companies we’ve worked with.
Do They Specialize?
Impactable is highly specialized in LinkedIn Ads management. They also target B2B startups but not necessarily those in the SaaS niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
Based on their LinkedIn profile information, they appear to have a stable and tight-knit core team that continues to grow with occasional new hires coming on.
15. Bayleaf Digital
Bayleaf Digital is a SaaS-specific marketing agency that relies on data analytics and ROI to measure success.
They understand firsthand the process and challenges involved with creating SaaS products, having developed their own in the early stages of the business.

Bayleaf Digital provides the full suite of marketing services – strategy development, PPC campaign management, SEO, content creation, and social media marketing.
They will work with you to develop a suitable marketing strategy and establish the correct product-market fit. They will then direct content creation to align with the strategy so it not only attracts but also converts. Bayleaf Digital gains quick wins through PPC campaigns while also sustainably building long-term SEO through content creation.
Bayleaf Digital caters predominately to small businesses, as opposed to Powered by Search, where we work with businesses of all sizes. This tells us that they don’t have the background or experience to tackle clients with large ARR and fast growth potential.
Do They Specialize?
Bayleaf Digital has set its sights firmly on B2B SaaS, but it occasionally takes on non-SaaS clients as well.
How is Internal Team Health?
Reviews from past and current employees on Glassdoor indicate Bayleaf Digital is a highly valued employer that prioritizes workplace culture. They provide rewarding professional challenges and flexible working conditions, which often contribute to retaining loyal employees.
16. Web Profits
Web Profits provide a digital growth framework that drives sustainable growth and profits. They can work together with an existing in-house marketing team or run the show as an entirely outsourced team.
When you sign on with Web Profits, you get full access to their dedicated SaaS “Hit Squad,” as they like to call their team of marketing professionals. They will step your business through their framework and develop a tailored strategy, create content, manage ad campaigns, and crunch the data, all under your watch. Their processes are aggressive and targeted, which often means more cost-effective budget spend.
As you can see, they cover a very broad range of services, so they’re not as specialized as Powered by Search.
Do They Specialize?
They specialize in SaaS companies of all sizes that have an established product-market fit and are ready to scale now.
How is Internal Team Health?
Overall, Web Profits gets a 4.7 score on Glassdoor, and from what we can see on their LinkedIn profile, they appear to have a reasonably large team with limited staff turnover. All in all, this indicates a stable, happy workplace.

Their team of marketing experts can hit the nail on the head for everything from SEO, content creation, and PPC ads to overall conversion rate optimization. They can develop high-ROI SEO strategies and take SEO even further to automate optimizations for enterprise-scale operations. By using SEO tactics and focusing on conversions, they create high-quality content for ad campaigns and other marketing needs.
Overall, Single Grain are highly driven by cost and returns, which means PPC ad campaigns are managed strictly to maximize ROAS. This is in contrast to Powered by Search, where short-term marketing metrics are not the cause of celebration but rather the overall business growth. We manage PPC campaigns across multiple channels to sustainably build brand awareness among your ideal customers.
Do They Specialize?
Single Grain doesn’t focus only on SaaS; B2B is their forte but they also work with clients in the e-commerce and e-learning industries.
How is Internal Team Health?
On Glassdoor, Single Grain has an overall score of 4.0, which is a little lower than some of the other agencies on our list, but the company is also much larger and has more staff turnover than others.

18. Hey Digital
Hey Digital is a B2B SaaS marketing agency that primarily uses paid marketing to achieve the desired customer conversions.

The services they offer include PPC campaign development and implementation across various channels. They craft quality, high-converting content for your ad campaigns and build landing pages that convert. Hey Digital will also produce video ads for the growing streaming market, which sets them apart from other agencies.
Unlike Powered by Search, Hey Digital doesn’t stray too far from developing and managing PPC campaigns. While we take a more holistic approach to demand generation using multiple avenues, including account-based marketing, SEO, and content marketing, they prioritize the best-fit leads and use tried and tested playbooks for success.
Do They Specialize?
Hey Digital is a specialized B2B SaaS marketing agency and doesn’t appear to sway from that niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
According to Hey Digital, they are a remote-first company with staff in various time zones. There are limited employee reviews on Glassdoor, and the company has a 5-star rating. From their LinkedIn, it’s clear they are a small team, and it would be fair to say that the overall team health is good.
19. Elevate Demand
Elevate Demand is a B2B growth marketing agency that helps companies make paid acquisition self-sustaining by building growth loops. This approach means the client gets the year-on-year growth without adding proportional costs to the mix.
The team is effective at creating paid ad campaigns with the right messaging and attractive offers. But, instead of these ad campaigns running as individual sales funnels, they loop, which compounds the results and brings in far more conversions. They also offer website design services. Much like landing page development, they will redesign a client’s website to become a high-powered conversion machine.
Elevate Demand offer similar marketing services and aim to achieve similar outcomes for their clients as we do at Powered by Search. However, we work with larger clients and, while they also offer website design services, we’re more detailed and take a deeper look at page performance.
Do They Specialize?
Elevate Demand strictly serves B2B SaaS clients and typically only works with companies that have a long-term mindset and firm goals. In addition, their ideal companies are those with an annual revenue of $2 million to $100 million or more and are ready to grow now.
How is Internal Team Health?
Elevate Demand remains a small but very functional team, according to their LinkedIn. They are not frequently hiring new staff, and this stability could be a positive factor if working with them.
20. SaaS Hero
SaaS Hero is a B2B SaaS marketing agency that focuses on maximizing ROI and optimizing every dollar spent. They typically aim to work with mid-market clients that make between $2 million and $20 million in annual revenue.
SaaS Hero works alongside an existing marketing team to establish objectives, plan, test, and implement. They’ll design and manage PPC campaigns on various channels, including social channels, Google Ads, and LinkedIn. They will build campaign-linked landing pages from the ground up and develop targeted content that meets the outlined strategy. Not many of the agencies we’ve listed provide specialist email marketing services, but SaaS Hero does. Their email marketing approach ensures the domain remains legitimate and emails have a high deliverability rate.
On paper, SaaS Hero and Powered by Search work in the same niche with the same type of clients. But in reality, we are more specialized and particularly well suited for enterprise-scale clients.
Do They Specialize?
SaaS Hero work with specific clients only within the B2B SaaS niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
SaaS Hero has a small number of employee reviews on Glassdoor but receives an overall 5-star score. All the reviews mention how they were able to develop and grow their career but also receive the necessary support from management. According to their LinkedIn, the team at SaaS Hero appears to be fairly small and globally dispersed. There is minimal staff turnover and nothing to indicate team instability.
21. Grow & Convert
Grow & Convert is a marketing agency specializing in content marketing, with expertise extending into SEO and PPC ads management. They work with B2B SaaS, e-commerce, and B2C clients and have worked with major B2B companies like Clearscope, Yelp, Leadfeeder, and iSpionage. Typically, their clients are those struggling in a competitive market or with minimal resources to put towards content development.
The agency collaborates with their clients to develop content strategies around high-converting topics rather than high-traffic keywords. Their writers focus on quality instead of quantity, and all pieces are thoroughly researched and written with the client’s target audience in mind. This approach is complemented by paid ads and strategic link-building to boost traffic and increase conversions.
Unlike Powered by Search, they do not exclusively work with B2B SaaS clients and focus mainly on content marketing rather than a wide range of digital marketing channels.
Do They Specialize?

They specialize in content marketing and have a team of skilled writers and SEO specialists who work with clients. However, they are not specialized towards a particular client type.
How is Internal Team Health
According to their LinkedIn, the median tenure at Grow & Convert is 3.5 years, which indicates a consistent and stable team. They don’t have any past employee reviews online, but from what can be gathered from their website, they invest in their staff and offer a flexible work-life balance. These things add up and result in happy employees dedicated to producing results and developing professionally.
22. Siege Media
Siege Media is a content and SEO marketing agency focused on delivering maximum ROI for clients. Some of their past clients include SaaS brands like Asana, Zendesk, HubSpot, and Zapier.
Their services include content strategy development, SEO content creation, and link building. Their experts also manage technical SEO and design.
They’re known for consistently producing competitive customer-centric content that ranks. Past clients report their professional work ethic as key to fuelling results and praise their responsive communication.
Siege Media shares some similarities with Powered by Search in the content marketing department. However, Powered by Search specializes in B2B SaaS demand generation using a variety of tactics and does not rely solely on content creation for an SEO boost.
Do They Specialize?

Although they have extensive experience working with SaaS clients, they don’t specialize in SaaS as they also work with fintech and e-commerce companies.
How is Internal Team Health?
Siege Media has an overall rating of 4 stars on Glassdoor, which is certainly not bad. However, some reviews suggest that the push to be competitive and fast-growing leaves some employees feeling overworked. In saying that, Siege Media has made it onto Inc’s Best Workplaces list multiple times.
It could be simply the case that some employees thrive at Siege Media while others do not. Either way, company culture encourages professional development and exceeding expectations, which is good news for clients.

While Webfx offers a similar range of services to Powered by Search, they don’t specialize in any particular marketing niche or industry, or even type of clients.
Do They Specialize?

Webfx does not specialize in B2B SaaS or any particular marketing niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
Overall, Webfx has a 4.2 star score on Glassdoor, with mixed reviews from past employees. Many say the potential for professional growth is high and the team is great to work with. However, many other past employees say the complete opposite.
According to LinkedIn, the median tenure period is 2.8 years, but they frequently hire new employees, which indicates some degree of staff turnover. The company has grown rapidly and now employs over 500 people.

Do They Specialize?

Ironpaper specializes in B2B clients, but not necessarily SaaS or a particular industry type.

Do They Specialize?

Roketto specializes in several very different industries, including SaaS & technology, industrial & manufacturing, and real estate development.
How is Internal Team Health?
Roketto doesn’t have a presence on Glassdoor, but their LinkedIn profile indicates that they have a small but reasonably stable team with minimal turnover.

All marketing strategies and campaigns are customer-centric and aligned with user needs. They develop thought-leadership content, secure high-quality backlinks, and manage PPC campaigns from start to finish. They also implement processes to reduce customer churn and optimize the user experience.
Both Inturact and Powered by Search work with enterprise-scale B2B SaaS clients and have a similar style of working alongside their clients to deliver results.

For startups, this includes paid search, website optimization, content marketing, workflow automations, and establishing KPIs and analytics. For scaleups, the needs are different. They expand the content marketing to include more bottom-of-funnel content, CRO, and ABM techniques.
Similarly to Powered by Search, TripleDart work exclusively with B2B SaaS, and they’re rapidly rising to prominence in the industry. However, TripleDart are a very young company, having only kicked off in 2021. Powered by Search, on the other hand, has been working with B2B SaaS clients since 2009 and have a trail of satisfied past clients.
Do They Specialize?

TripleDart only works with B2B SaaS clients, and their team is made up of experts with experience in this niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
TripleDart have an overall rating of 4.8 on Glassdoor, which is very good. However, according to their LinkedIn, they’ve grown rapidly and appear to have a high staff turnover with a median tenure period of under a year at this stage in the company’s establishment. This definitely signals some instability and should be of concern for potential new clients.
Selecting The Best SaaS Marketing Agency
If you’ve historically struggled to find high-quality agency partners, it might be because the criteria you use to evaluate agencies is missing some critical pieces.
So instead, use the following criteria to evaluate each agency:

Do they have a proven process that consistently produces the results you want?
Do they specialize in serving B2B SaaS companies with buying cycles similar to ours?
Is their internal team happy?

						Choosing a B2B SaaS marketing agency is tricky because, on the surface, they all seem similar.
So when you Google “best SaaS marketing agencies” and see a list of 20 or 28 different options, how do you distinguish a world-class SaaS Marketing agency from a mediocre one?
Unfortunately, most clients don’t figure out the answer to this question until after hiring an agency and wasting thousands of dollars – not to mention all the missed sales opportunities a more effective agency could have helped you win.
To help you avoid hiring the wrong agency, here’s what we’ll cover:

How most clients evaluate SaaS marketing agencies (and why the method is flawed)
An alternative agency evaluation method that can help you better gauge an agency’s ability to produce an ROI

Why Traditional SaaS Marketing Agency Evaluation Methods Are Flawed
Most traditional agency evaluation advice includes:

Analyzing case studies
Years of experience
Pricing

However, we’ve found that most clients using these criteria as the main decision framework have a history of receiving disappointing results and switching agencies frequently.
Below, we’ll discuss the flaws with each evaluation principle and then provide a more effective evaluation criterion.
1. Analyzing case studies
Most agencies (even mediocre providers) can show you a handful of great case studies, but that doesn’t mean they can predictably duplicate those results for your company.
Why?
Clients with great products/services can grow organically without marketing. So, the agency itself might not have caused the company’s growth.
Secondly, the law of averages says that some marketing campaigns will be lucky and go well. Even if the agency shows you five successful campaigns, they might have run 50 campaigns to get those five winners.
So, case studies don’t always accurately reflect the agency’s average results – only their best results.
2. Years of experience
Most people think that marketing agencies with more experience produce better results.
While you certainly don’t want to hire an agency with no experience, there’s rarely a direct correlation between ROI and the number of years an agency has been in business.
This is true for a few reasons.
First, many mediocre agencies stay in business because they’re excellent at lead generation. So even if dissatisfied clients churn, they can always generate more leads and stay in business.
Additionally, marketing is constantly evolving, and agencies need to adjust their strategies accordingly to continue delivering a strong ROI.
If one of the key selling points the agency pitches is its years of marketing experience, it could be a red flag that they use dated marketing practices.
3. Pricing
Many clients mistakenly judge the cost of hiring an agency based on price rather than ROI.
Choosing a cheaper agency that produces mediocre results is often more expensive than hiring a premium agency that produces better results.
This is especially true as many phantom costs involve hiring a low-performing agency, like time and resources devoted to onboarding.
You can use the three criteria above to narrow the list of agencies you talk to, though we recommend against using it to make your final decision.
A More Effective SaaS Marketing Evaluation Criterion
From watching the broader SaaS marketing agency industry and our own experience partnering with over 100 B2B SaaS companies, we’ve found some common themes among the most successful client/agency relationships.
Specifically, client/agency relationships that have mutual trust, last the longest, and are highly productive in terms of results and growth tend to:

Implement proven processes – The agency has implemented a similar process with steady success across other similar SaaS companies at similar growth stages.
Specialize in a specific type of client – The agency only works with a particular kind of company (i.e., B2B enterprise SaaS) at a specific growth stage (i.e., $10-100M ARR).
Prioritize internal team strength and health – As an agency is a service-based business, the people are one of the most significant that impact ROI. So, agencies prioritizing hiring and retaining outstanding talent tend to deliver better results.

As you can see, these three criteria are much more specific, making them more effective at distinguishing outstanding agencies from mediocre ones. We’ll discuss them in more detail below.
1. Do they have a proven process for marketing SaaS companies like yours?
We discussed that most marketing agencies can show prospects a handful of successful case studies, but that doesn’t mean they can consistently produce those results.
Processes eliminate many variables that cause inconsistent results, so agencies with proven processes tend to deliver better results.
During the evaluation process, ask them to transparently lay out their process and walk you through how they executed it in each case study. If they don’t have a proven process or say they offer different custom-tailored solutions for each company, that’s a red flag.
Sure, you want to make sure that they can adjust to the nuances of your business, but if they’re starting from scratch every time, they’ll have to test a lot more variables (channels, messages, etc.), which costs you money and increases the timeline to see an ROI.
2. Do they specialize in B2B SaaS?
If an agency works with SaaS companies, e-commerce companies, and service businesses, they probably apply a “one-size-fits-all” marketing approach to all their clients.
A one-size-fits-all agency might drive some results, but it probably won’t drive the best results as the process isn’t designed for the nuances of your customer’s journey, and the employees in the agency probably don’t specialize in SaaS marketing.
So, to make the most of your marketing investment, we recommend you hire expert consultants as you grow (we’ll introduce you to some below) and only hire an agency when you have the budget to work with a B2B SaaS specialist.
3. How healthy and happy is their internal team, and how is it structured?
Service-based businesses are notoriously tricky to hire because your ROI depends largely on the people executing the process.
So, how do you evaluate an agency’s internal team health?
First, you can look at employee churn and tenure on LinkedIn.

If the talent working on your account constantly changes, you’ll inevitably lose some time, money, and ground on competitors as they learn the nuances of your business.
High churn also indicates that employees are dissatisfied. Unfortunately, unmotivated and unhappy people don’t perform at their best.
To further investigate employee happiness, look at the company’s Glassdoor reviews.
In addition to employee satisfaction, evaluate the experience level of the employees working on your account.
While this may seem tricky, a simple method to gauge employee skill level is to see how frequently an agency’s junior staff are promoted to VP and director-level roles (you can do this by looking at the employees’ LinkedIn profiles).
A high pace of juniors moving into leadership roles in a speedy manner indicates that you’ll be dealing with inexperienced leaders if you hire the company.
Most people consider only these 4 SaaS marketing agencies if they’re between $10M-100M annually recurring revenue
If you Google “best SaaS marketing agencies,” you’ll get an unsorted, under-critical list of agencies that the post’s author doesn’t really want you to consider and their own agency at the top of the list in the hopes that you choose them.
While we have also placed our own agency at the top of the list, we’ve explained the reasons for this and given in-depth views on why you might want to choose a different agency.
If you’d like to know how we think about competitor comparison pages, check out this guide
In reality, only four agencies are designed to generate demand for a B2B SaaS product of $10-100M. Of those four, two can serve $100M+ ARR businesses.
So, we’ll introduce you to these agencies and provide an overview of their marketing approach.
If you’re still at an early growth stage, the rest of this list provides an overview of several highly specialized SaaS individuals that can help you reach the next growth stage.
1. Powered By Search
Notable Clients: Freshbooks, Basecamp, Collibra, Varonis, Elastic, VMWare, and 150+ other B2B SaaS category leaders.
Typically, we aren’t the first marketing agency our clients have worked with, but they come to us because they want to solve one of the following problems:

“We can’t scale paid media profitably. Our CPA is rising. No agency has been able to fix this.”
“People are watching the webinar but don’t convert afterward.”
“We’re generating leads, but they aren’t turning into revenue when they get to sales.”
“Our product is great. But no one knows who we are. We feel like the best-kept secret in town.”

While it’s easy for marketing agencies to say they can solve these problems, we’ve built a proven system and strategy for B2B SaaS marketing (our Predictable Growth Model) that consistently solves them for our B2B SaaS clients.
Here’s how it works:
How The Predictable Growth Model helps B2B SaaS companies become unstoppable
We believe you’ll have an unstoppable SaaS business if you can accomplish these three things:

Increase in QPC (quality of pipeline certainty) – You’re consistently generating a steady quantity of high-quality leads.
Decrease in CAC (customer acquisition costs) – You can acquire customers for less money.
Increase in LTV (lifetime value) – Your ideal customers invest more with you and stay longer.

The Predictable Growth Model is based on these guiding principles and consists of three key elements: attract, engage, and convert.
 

You can read our predictable growth model methodology overview to learn about the intricate details of this strategy, though here’s a brief overview of the three key points.
Attract – Go from obscurity to dominance
Attraction is about ensuring you are getting the right people onto your website, with the right messages, and de-anonymizing them.
A key failure of many SaaS marketing systems is filling their pipelines with the wrong people. The downstream effects of getting poor fit traffic onto your website are broad and significant.
Your website is usually the first opportunity for a visitor to decide whether your product is right for them or not. If you get the wrong people onto your website, then you’re going to experience low conversion rates, and if you’re sending that traffic with an ‘expensive’ channel like LinkedIn Ads, then your campaign costs will soar.
On the other hand, by attracting the right people to your website and getting them into your funnel, you increase quality pipeline certainty (QPC) and because they’re the right fit prospects and you’re clear on your transformational promise to them, you will see increase lifetime value (LTV)
Engage – Eliminate friction in your conversion machine
Engagement is about leveraging the hard work done in attracting right-fit traffic, and combining it with educational content and calibrated calls-to-action to turn website visitors into prospects.
The primary goal of engagement is to increase quality pipeline certainty (QPC), which, as you’ll see in the next section on conversion, also helps reduce the customer acquisition cost (CAC) by improving conversion from anonymous visitor to ready to talk to sales.
To improve your QPC, we focus on pinpointing customer pain points, educating and motivating prospects, and calibrating calls to action. By doing so, more visitors will understand that your product is tailored to address their specific needs in ways that other products cannot.
Additionally, they will gain a clear understanding of the appropriate actions to take based on their stage in the buyer readiness journey.
Convert – Go from loose engagement to locked-in prospects
Conversion is about making sure that the customers you’re acquiring to stick around and pay you for long enough to make economic sense for your company.
Even with the best acquisition system in the world, if your customers churn at too high a rate then you’re throwing good money after bad. Businesses that are able to retain customers for a long period of time can usually afford to invest significantly more in their marketing because they know that they’ll get that investment back in subsequent years.
If you can decrease the cost of acquisition (CAC) while simultaneously increasing the lifetime value of customers (LTV) you are well on your way to building a great SaaS business.
You can learn more about how we connect marketing channels to work together in our demand gen flywheel post.
How Powered By Search is Different
Plenty of marketing agencies execute aspects of this model (attract, engage, convert), but Powered By Search is the only agency that takes a holistic approach to marketing by fully addressing each of the attract, engage, and convert stages.
We’ve found that if you only execute one or two of these three stages, you might see some results, but you won’t be able to predictable decrease CAC and increase QPC and LTV.
To see how we’ve implemented this model across a variety of different companies, check out some of these SaaS marketing case studies:

How Powered by Search Helped iWave Achieve a 7-Figure Revenue Growth from Paid Media in Under a Year
How we helped Loopio increase demos by 41% quarter over quarter and achieve consistent growth
How We Helped PointClickCare Get Over 2000 Leads with LinkedIn Ads

Do They Specialize?
We work exclusively with B2B SaaS companies that sell to enterprise customers.
Unlike most SaaS marketing agencies, we’ve developed a proven process optimized to navigate the complexities of longer customer journeys and are familiar with the nuanced challenges you’re currently facing.
How is Internal Team Health?

We prioritize exclusively hiring senior level subject matter experts. So, instead of hiring account managers like traditional agencies do, we pay top dollar for the talent that’s actually executing your marketing strategy.
You can check out our LinkedIn profile to see our employees’ impressive backgrounds for yourself.
We also realize that the experts we’ve hired could find another job tomorrow, so we prioritize their well-being and cultivate a workplace they enjoy.
This strategy has worked out well. Looking at our Glassdoor reviews, you’ll see that the average team member has stayed with us for over two years.
This means you won’t have to build new relationships with new account managers every few months or worry about losing ground on competitors as new team members learn about your business.

2. Refine Labs
Refine Labs offers demand generation advisory and execution. They’ve shifted towards a community-driven growth model, introducing resources like the Vault and a process called Revenue R&D. However, it’s unclear how this benefits their clients in practice.
Refine Labs focuses on “demand creation” rather than demand generation, believing that most sales occur through conversations on platforms like LinkedIn and Slack (“dark social”). As these conversations are challenging to track, Refine Labs doesn’t use tracking tools like Google Analytics or Salesforce. Instead, they rely on self-reported attribution as their single source of truth, an approach we find flawed in our own article on the topic.
This methodology may present organizational and financial challenges when demonstrating ROI to your board and CFO. At Powered By Search, we believe that customer touchpoints mentioned in surveys are often just a part of the journey and could be subject to inaccuracies.
Additionally, top-of-the-funnel efforts, like podcasts, are awareness mediums, not lead acquisition channels. Attributing an entire conversion to a single medium, such as a podcast, is inaccurate.
As for their tactical approach to demand creation, Refine Labs lacks written documentation of their strategy. According to clients who previously worked with them, they typically recommend random acts of marketing, like starting a podcast or writing content. However, these strategies lack cohesion and optimization, taking an extended period to deliver ROI for your business.
Do They Specialize?
Refine Labs specializes in serving B2B companies, but not specifically B2B SaaS.
How is Internal Team Health?
They recently laid off about 40% of their staff, and the median employee tenure is just over a year.

 
Looking through their LinkedIn profile, you’ll notice they have a robust client management staff which puts middle management in between you and the people working on your marketing.
They have a 4.3 star rating on Glassdoor.
If you need a specialist agency or consultant, here’s who we’d recommend

He begins his process by interviewing your team to learn more about your business and then he conducts some preliminary market research to learn more about potential customer pain points.
Using that data, he creates a handful of different campaigns, tests them, and then uses those results to give you a comprehensive growth strategy.
You can read about how he has successfully used this strategy in these case studies.
5. 42 Agency – Kamil Rextin

6. Growth Sprints – Brendan Hufford

His approach begins with product and content-led SEO, using product data to drive SEO initiatives. Then, he creates revenue-focused content to support sales, success, and support teams. Subsequently, Brendan generates demand by building extensive brand awareness through content. Lastly, he emphasizes digital PR by focusing on creating linkable assets rather than engaging in spammy outreach tactics.
You can see his client case studies here.
7. Growth Plays – JH Scherck
JH is an expert at building SEO foundations for startups. So you’ll get a content strategy and SEO plan to support your go-to-market strategy.
He typically offers 4-6 month contracts and helps you build a personalized SEO plan before sending you to a larger agency.

8. Demand Maven – Asia Orangio Matos

To see this process in action, you can read their case studies here.
9. Forget the Funnel – Claire Suellentrop and Georgiana Laudi
The team at Forget The Funnel specializes in customer-led growth for B2B SaaS companies.
This means that they focus on discovering who your best customers are, the pain points that make them buy, and how you can adjust your marketing and messaging to attract more of them.

11. Kalungi
Founded in 2018, Kalungi is a full-service B2B SaaS marketing agency that specializes in helping early-stage software companies hit the ground running.
On the other hand, Powered by Search has been around since 2009 and has a proven process of using both paid and organic strategies to grow demo and trial-based SaaS and B2B technology businesses.
Working with Kalungi looks different for each company, depending on their needs. Typically, you can take one of two paths to achieve your business growth goals: get an entire marketing team on demand or bring in a dedicated CMO to guide your existing marketing team.
A full engagement with Kalungi involves three elements: marketing leadership, inbound marketing, and account-based marketing. For companies with an ARR of no more than $50 million, the CMO will guide the team anywhere between 8-18 months. Kalungi states that the benefit of outsourcing marketing leadership is that they can switch up the CMO as the needs of the company change over time.
Do They Specialize?
Yes, Kalungi specializes in early-stage B2B SaaS companies and guides them through their growth journey.
How is Internal Team Health?
Kalungi has an overall score of 4.3 on Glassdoor, with most reviews indicating the workplace culture is good. Teams are knowledgeable, management puts people first, and there are plenty of professional development opportunities.
12. Simple Tiger
Simple Tiger is a SaaS marketing agency that combines their own AI technology and a playbook of tactics that give fast results. They focus on SEO and PPC to drive traffic and revenue for clients.
Based on what you need, you can work with them in different ways: an hourly consulting format, a one-time SEO audit, or have them manage entire PPC campaigns.
The team at Simple Tiger will analyze your site health and competition before establishing a suitable strategy and roadmap for execution. They will do a deep keyword analysis to find all the low-hanging fruit or gaps that can be exploited, and then develop world-class content. Combine this with a quality link-building strategy, and that’s your SEO done.
Powered by Search offers many of the same services; however, we focus on demand generation and building sustainable growth instead of quick wins.
Do They Specialize?
They specialize in SaaS, but not strictly B2B SaaS, as they also work with B2C and Fintech clients.
How is Internal Team Health?
There’s nothing available online or on Glassdoor about Simple Tiger employee satisfaction. But according to their LinkedIn profile, they appear to have a stable team of employees with minimal turnover.
13. Skale
Skale is an SEO agency that helps SaaS companies grow and expand their reach. Their services, which include SEO management, link building, and content marketing, are focused not only on building organic traffic but also on driving tangible results like product signups, activations, and MRR.
If you team up with Skale, you’ll have access to an SEO strategist, content SEO specialist, tech SEO analyst, and an off-page SEO manager. These SEO experts will develop a 3-month plan of attack, complete extensive keyword research, and recommend page optimizations.
Just like Powered by Search, Skale also focuses on B2B SaaS clients; however, they don’t have the same level of experience with enterprise clients.
Do They Specialize?
Skale focuses solely on B2B SaaS clients.
How is Internal Team Health?
There are limited employee reviews available on Glassdoor, but they are all positive. In addition to that, Skale promotes itself as an ethical employer, taking into consideration work-life balance and their carbon footprint. It’s safe to say all is well at Skale.
14. Impactable
Impactable is a B2B marketing agency that focuses on LinkedIn Ads for high-growth startups.
With Justin Rowe as a founder, who is known as the world’s leading LinkedIn expert, you know you’re getting top-quality LinkedIn Ads services and advice here. Their focus on LinkedIn Ads is so strong that they’ve even built their own tools to manage ads and reporting.
They manage all avenues of LinkedIn Ads, including lead generation and targeting niche audiences, effective ad retargeting, and demand generation strategy development. Besides specializing in LinkedIn Ads, they also offer a Google Ads paid search management service.
Impactable doesn’t mention specific outcomes or results they’ve achieved for clients, which is certainly unhelpful when researching a SaaS marketing agency to work with. At Powered by Search, on the other hand, we are clear and upfront about the results we’ve helped our clients achieve and the companies we’ve worked with.
Do They Specialize?
Impactable is highly specialized in LinkedIn Ads management. They also target B2B startups but not necessarily those in the SaaS niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
Based on their LinkedIn profile information, they appear to have a stable and tight-knit core team that continues to grow with occasional new hires coming on.
15. Bayleaf Digital
Bayleaf Digital is a SaaS-specific marketing agency that relies on data analytics and ROI to measure success.
They understand firsthand the process and challenges involved with creating SaaS products, having developed their own in the early stages of the business. They work with B2B SaaS companies of all shapes and sizes at every stage in their journey, including low CLV SaaS and enterprise-scale businesses.
Bayleaf Digital provides the full suite of marketing services – strategy development, PPC campaign management, SEO, content creation, and social media marketing.
They will work with you to develop a suitable marketing strategy and establish the correct product-market fit. They will then direct content creation to align with the strategy so it not only attracts but also converts. Bayleaf Digital gains quick wins through PPC campaigns while also sustainably building long-term SEO through content creation.
Bayleaf Digital caters predominately to small businesses, as opposed to Powered by Search, where we work with businesses of all sizes. This tells us that they don’t have the background or experience to tackle clients with large ARR and fast growth potential.
Do They Specialize?
Bayleaf Digital has set its sights firmly on B2B SaaS, but it occasionally takes on non-SaaS clients as well.
How is Internal Team Health?
Reviews from past and current employees on Glassdoor indicate Bayleaf Digital is a highly valued employer that prioritizes workplace culture. They provide rewarding professional challenges and flexible working conditions, which often contribute to retaining loyal employees.
16. Web Profits
Web Profits provide a digital growth framework that drives sustainable growth and profits. They can work together with an existing in-house marketing team or run the show as an entirely outsourced team.
When you sign on with Web Profits, you get full access to their dedicated SaaS “Hit Squad,” as they like to call their team of marketing professionals. They will step your business through their framework and develop a tailored strategy, create content, manage ad campaigns, and crunch the data, all under your watch. Their processes are aggressive and targeted, which often means more cost-effective budget spend.
As you can see, they cover a very broad range of services, so they’re not as specialized as Powered by Search.
Do They Specialize?
They specialize in SaaS companies of all sizes that have an established product-market fit and are ready to scale now.
How is Internal Team Health?
Overall, Web Profits gets a 4.7 score on Glassdoor, and from what we can see on their LinkedIn profile, they appear to have a reasonably large team with limited staff turnover. All in all, this indicates a stable, happy workplace.
17. Single Grain
Single Grain offer a full range of marketing services to help clients reach and surpass revenue goals. They have worked with major clients like Amazon, Uber, Salesforce, Airbnb, and Crunchbase, to name a few.
Their team of marketing experts can hit the nail on the head for everything from SEO, content creation, and PPC ads to overall conversion rate optimization. They can develop high-ROI SEO strategies and take SEO even further to automate optimizations for enterprise-scale operations. By using SEO tactics and focusing on conversions, they create high-quality content for ad campaigns and other marketing needs.
Overall, Single Grain are highly driven by cost and returns, which means PPC ad campaigns are managed strictly to maximize ROAS. This is in contrast to Powered by Search, where short-term marketing metrics are not the cause of celebration but rather the overall business growth. We manage PPC campaigns across multiple channels to sustainably build brand awareness among your ideal customers.
Do They Specialize?
Single Grain doesn’t focus only on SaaS; B2B is their forte but they also work with clients in the e-commerce and e-learning industries.
How is Internal Team Health?
On Glassdoor, Single Grain has an overall score of 4.0, which is a little lower than some of the other agencies on our list, but the company is also much larger and has more staff turnover than others. In general, past employees mentioned some positive aspects, like a nice work-life balance and push towards personal and professional growth.
18. Hey Digital
Hey Digital is a B2B SaaS marketing agency that primarily uses paid marketing to achieve the desired customer conversions.
They don’t follow a generic marketing template; each client strategy is tailor-made and includes the necessary testing to ensure money is well spent. They’re a fun young team that has worked with companies like Pitch, Hotjar, and Writesonic.
The services they offer include PPC campaign development and implementation across various channels. They craft quality, high-converting content for your ad campaigns and build landing pages that convert. Hey Digital will also produce video ads for the growing streaming market, which sets them apart from other agencies.
Unlike Powered by Search, Hey Digital doesn’t stray too far from developing and managing PPC campaigns. While we take a more holistic approach to demand generation using multiple avenues, including account-based marketing, SEO, and content marketing, they prioritize the best-fit leads and use tried and tested playbooks for success.
Do They Specialize?
Hey Digital is a specialized B2B SaaS marketing agency and doesn’t appear to sway from that niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
According to Hey Digital, they are a remote-first company with staff in various time zones. There are limited employee reviews on Glassdoor, and the company has a 5-star rating. From their LinkedIn, it’s clear they are a small team, and it would be fair to say that the overall team health is good.
19. Elevate Demand
Elevate Demand is a B2B growth marketing agency that helps companies make paid acquisition self-sustaining by building growth loops. This approach means the client gets the year-on-year growth without adding proportional costs to the mix.
The team is effective at creating paid ad campaigns with the right messaging and attractive offers. But, instead of these ad campaigns running as individual sales funnels, they loop, which compounds the results and brings in far more conversions. They also offer website design services. Much like landing page development, they will redesign a client’s website to become a high-powered conversion machine.
Elevate Demand offer similar marketing services and aim to achieve similar outcomes for their clients as we do at Powered by Search. However, we work with larger clients and, while they also offer website design services, we’re more detailed and take a deeper look at page performance.
Do They Specialize?
Elevate Demand strictly serves B2B SaaS clients and typically only works with companies that have a long-term mindset and firm goals. In addition, their ideal companies are those with an annual revenue of $2 million to $100 million or more and are ready to grow now.
How is Internal Team Health?
Elevate Demand remains a small but very functional team, according to their LinkedIn. They are not frequently hiring new staff, and this stability could be a positive factor if working with them.
20. SaaS Hero
SaaS Hero is a B2B SaaS marketing agency that focuses on maximizing ROI and optimizing every dollar spent. They typically aim to work with mid-market clients that make between $2 million and $20 million in annual revenue.
SaaS Hero works alongside an existing marketing team to establish objectives, plan, test, and implement. They’ll design and manage PPC campaigns on various channels, including social channels, Google Ads, and LinkedIn. They will build campaign-linked landing pages from the ground up and develop targeted content that meets the outlined strategy. Not many of the agencies we’ve listed provide specialist email marketing services, but SaaS Hero does. Their email marketing approach ensures the domain remains legitimate and emails have a high deliverability rate.
On paper, SaaS Hero and Powered by Search work in the same niche with the same type of clients. But in reality, we are more specialized and particularly well suited for enterprise-scale clients.
Do They Specialize?
SaaS Hero work with specific clients only within the B2B SaaS niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
SaaS Hero has a small number of employee reviews on Glassdoor but receives an overall 5-star score. All the reviews mention how they were able to develop and grow their career but also receive the necessary support from management. According to their LinkedIn, the team at SaaS Hero appears to be fairly small and globally dispersed. There is minimal staff turnover and nothing to indicate team instability.
21. Grow & Convert
Grow & Convert is a marketing agency specializing in content marketing, with expertise extending into SEO and PPC ads management. They work with B2B SaaS, e-commerce, and B2C clients and have worked with major B2B companies like Clearscope, Yelp, Leadfeeder, and iSpionage. Typically, their clients are those struggling in a competitive market or with minimal resources to put towards content development.
The agency collaborates with their clients to develop content strategies around high-converting topics rather than high-traffic keywords. Their writers focus on quality instead of quantity, and all pieces are thoroughly researched and written with the client’s target audience in mind. This approach is complemented by paid ads and strategic link-building to boost traffic and increase conversions.
Unlike Powered by Search, they do not exclusively work with B2B SaaS clients and focus mainly on content marketing rather than a wide range of digital marketing channels.
Do They Specialize?

They specialize in content marketing and have a team of skilled writers and SEO specialists who work with clients. However, they are not specialized towards a particular client type.
How is Internal Team Health
According to their LinkedIn, the median tenure at Grow & Convert is 3.5 years, which indicates a consistent and stable team. They don’t have any past employee reviews online, but from what can be gathered from their website, they invest in their staff and offer a flexible work-life balance. These things add up and result in happy employees dedicated to producing results and developing professionally.
22. Siege Media
Siege Media is a content and SEO marketing agency focused on delivering maximum ROI for clients. Some of their past clients include SaaS brands like Asana, Zendesk, HubSpot, and Zapier.
Their services include content strategy development, SEO content creation, and link building. Their experts also manage technical SEO and design.
They’re known for consistently producing competitive customer-centric content that ranks. Past clients report their professional work ethic as key to fuelling results and praise their responsive communication.
Siege Media shares some similarities with Powered by Search in the content marketing department. However, Powered by Search specializes in B2B SaaS demand generation using a variety of tactics and does not rely solely on content creation for an SEO boost.
Do They Specialize?

Although they have extensive experience working with SaaS clients, they don’t specialize in SaaS as they also work with fintech and e-commerce companies.
How is Internal Team Health?
Siege Media has an overall rating of 4 stars on Glassdoor, which is certainly not bad. However, some reviews suggest that the push to be competitive and fast-growing leaves some employees feeling overworked. In saying that, Siege Media has made it onto Inc’s Best Workplaces list multiple times.
It could be simply the case that some employees thrive at Siege Media while others do not. Either way, company culture encourages professional development and exceeding expectations, which is good news for clients.
23. Webfx
Webfx is a well-established digital marketing agency that employs over 500 subject matter experts. They’ll tackle any digital business challenge from low website traffic to a high CPL and offer their digital marketing product, MarketingCloudFX, which enables customers to pull together actionable, data-driven insights.
Because the Webfx team is so large, they offer a huge range of marketing services. They develop and implement detailed SEO strategies that cover on-page, off-page, and technical SEO, have experts in marketing automation techniques for account-based and email marketing, cover lead generation, PPC management, and CRO, and offer website and landing page design services.
While Webfx offers a similar range of services to Powered by Search, they don’t specialize in any particular marketing niche or industry, or even type of clients.
Do They Specialize?

Webfx does not specialize in B2B SaaS or any particular marketing niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
Overall, Webfx has a 4.2 star score on Glassdoor, with mixed reviews from past employees. Many say the potential for professional growth is high and the team is great to work with. However, many other past employees say the complete opposite.
According to LinkedIn, the median tenure period is 2.8 years, but they frequently hire new employees, which indicates some degree of staff turnover. The company has grown rapidly and now employs over 500 people.
24. Ironpaper
Ironpaper is a B2B growth agency that helps clients generate good-fit leads, improve buyer engagement, provide high-quality content, and ultimately, reach their growth goals. They only work with B2B companies and previous clients in the SaaS, e-commerce, finance, and logistics industries.
Ironpaper’s services include account-based marketing, CRO, lead nurturing, content creation, PPC, website design, customer research, and strategy development. All marketing decisions are data-driven, which brings solid lead generation that continues to pay off over time.
They have a similar business model to Powered by Search – with a focus on developing a sustainable growth strategy and kicking vanity metrics out the door. However, they don’t have the specialty expertise in B2B SaaS that Powered by Search does.
Do They Specialize?

Ironpaper specializes in B2B clients, but not necessarily SaaS or a particular industry type.
How is Internal Team Health?
On Glassdoor, they have a 4.2 star rating with many current and former employees praising the professional growth opportunities and fast-paced working environment. According to their LinkedIn, the median tenure at Ironpaper is 2.9 years and, overall, the company appears to have a stable team that enables good long-term working relationships with clients.
25. DEPT
DEPT, formerly known as 3Q/DEPT, is a marketing agency with a core focus on serving enterprise-scale clients. Past clients include brands like Uniqlo, Square, Twilio, and Titleist, and they’ve received positive client reviews, with many praising the in-house expertise at DEPT and the agency’s willingness to go the extra mile.
DEPT offers a wide range of marketing services, from strategy development to PPC management, SEO, and CRO. They aim to create high revenue-driving PPC campaigns that incorporate the customer’s first-party data and smart marketing automations. Their SEO skill set includes developing sustainable long-term SEO strategies that bring growth and improve SERP ranking. They take a methodical approach to link building and carefully vet and secure backlinks from the best sources. And their CRO strategies are woven into all of their plans to get maximum benefit from SEO or PPC campaigns.
While DEPT works with a variety of mid to large-size B2B businesses, they are not limited to SaaS clients.
Do They Specialize?

DEPT are a B2B marketing agency, and a majority of their past clients are enterprise-scale. The team consists of creatives and tech engineers with specialized AI skills, data analytics know-how, and gaming industry expertise. However, they do not strictly work with SaaS clients.
How is Internal Team Health?
Overall, DEPT has a 3.9 star rating on Glassdoor and the median tenure is 3.8 years. Former and current employees all mention the high workload as a negative, however, the perks and workplace environment are notable positives. According to its LinkedIn profile, the company has scaled back its workforce in the last 12 months, indicating some recent departmental reshuffling.
26. Roketto
Roketto is a design and inbound marketing agency that helps companies reach their growth goals fast. They develop marketing strategies that nurture and walk leads from the beginning of the funnel to the point of conversion.
Their services comprise of web design and a full suite of marketing services, including SEO content and PPC. Roketto are a HubSpot-certified partner and a Google partner with over 10 years of experience using Google AdWords. They maintain a strong professional relationship with clients – each client is assigned an account manager and an implementation team and receives regular monthly reports and quarterly reviews.
Roketto works similarly to Powered by Search in driving growth by using industry-leading techniques and tools. Both agencies are Canadian-based and target B2B SaaS clients. However, Powered by Search focuses solely on the B2B SaaS niche, while Roketto also works across other industries.
Do They Specialize?

Roketto specializes in several very different industries, including SaaS & technology, industrial & manufacturing, and real estate development.
How is Internal Team Health?
Roketto doesn’t have a presence on Glassdoor, but their LinkedIn profile indicates that they have a small but reasonably stable team with minimal turnover. The median tenure length is 3.8 years, which is a decent amount of time and indicates a happy working environment and a positive team to work with.
27. Inturact
Inturact is a data-driven SaaS marketing agency that focuses on companies whose growth has stalled. Its clients include companies with over $1M ARR.
Inturact use data insights and follow a methodical process to develop effective strategies for each client. Their process begins with roughly 4-6 weeks of observation and analyzing client data. They will then spend about 2 weeks validating their insights to ensure the data and results are sound before investing time and energy in developing a strategy.
All marketing strategies and campaigns are customer-centric and aligned with user needs. They develop thought-leadership content, secure high-quality backlinks, and manage PPC campaigns from start to finish. They also implement processes to reduce customer churn and optimize the user experience.
Both Inturact and Powered by Search work with enterprise-scale B2B SaaS clients and have a similar style of working alongside their clients to deliver results. The difference is that Powered by Search use a demand generation strategy that ensures clients achieve the desired growth that doesn’t stagnate over time.
Do They Specialize?

Inturact are specialized in B2B SaaS and prioritize clients with over $1M ARR and an established product-market fit.
How is Internal Team Health?
According to Inturact’s LinkedIn profile, the median tenure length is 5 years, which is a significant amount of time. They also have an overall 5 star rating on Glassdoor and virtually no negative points raised. It would be safe to say the team at Inturact are happy and motivated to put in 110% on the job.
28. TripleDart
TripleDart are a B2B SaaS marketing agency that has worked with a wide range of SaaS brands involved in e-commerce, fintech, martech, sales, HR, and generative AI.
TripleDart offer two tailored services – one for startups and one for scaleups. For startups, this includes paid search, website optimization, content marketing, workflow automations, and establishing KPIs and analytics. For scaleups, the needs are different. They expand the content marketing to include more bottom-of-funnel content, CRO, and ABM techniques.
Similarly to Powered by Search, TripleDart work exclusively with B2B SaaS, and they’re rapidly rising to prominence in the industry. However, TripleDart are a very young company, having only kicked off in 2021. Powered by Search, on the other hand, has been working with B2B SaaS clients since 2009 and have a trail of satisfied past clients.
Do They Specialize?

TripleDart only works with B2B SaaS clients, and their team is made up of experts with experience in this niche.
How is Internal Team Health?
TripleDart have an overall rating of 4.8 on Glassdoor, which is very good. However, according to their LinkedIn, they’ve grown rapidly and appear to have a high staff turnover with a median tenure period of under a year at this stage in the company’s establishment. This definitely signals some instability and should be of concern for potential new clients.
Selecting The Best SaaS Marketing Agency
If you’ve historically struggled to find high-quality agency partners, it might be because the criteria you use to evaluate agencies is missing some critical pieces.
So instead, use the following criteria to evaluate each agency:

Do they have a proven process that consistently produces the results you want?
Do they specialize in serving B2B SaaS companies with buying cycles similar to ours?
Is their internal team happy?

https://www.poweredbysearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AEO_Unlocked__Your_Guide_to_Dominating_AI-Powered_Search_and_Avoiding_Digital_Invisibility.mp3
Over the last two quarters, we’ve started working with enterprise B2B SaaS brands on a specific mandate. Growth marketers at these organizations have asked us, “How do we get ranked on ChatGPT?”. Others have been impacted by Google’s recent core updates where they’ve seen as much as 20-50% drops in traffic. 
You’re in the right place if you’re wondering some of the questions about your B2B SaaS company right now.

This question is popping up in our DM’s and marketing Slack channels everywhere.
The buzz is undeniable. But while everyone’s discussing Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) in theory, almost no one has a concrete, proven playbook for implementation. Marketers are scrambling for answers as their traditional SEO playbooks become increasingly outdated.
We’ve Been in the Trenches Since Day One
Since Perplexity’s launch in 2022, we’ve refined our Answer Engine Optimization methodology. When ChatGPT added browsing in March 2023, we immediately scaled operations, treating these platforms as primary acquisition channels.
Our AEO approach isn’t theoretical. Through testing with dozens of our B2B SaaS clients, the evidence is clear: strategic Answer Engine Optimization captures high-intent traffic that traditional SEO can’t reach.
AEO Rankings: The New Competitive Battlefield
Our research reveals a fascinating pattern. Let’s take a popular enterprise software category like FP&A software (financial planning & analysis). Suppose we’re working with Prophix and want to find out how well they are positioning in AEO (Answer Engine Optimzation).
Here’s how different FP&A solutions rank across AI platforms:

Notice something crucial? Prophix appears consistently but ranks lower than it should for its capabilities. This is the exact opportunity LLM SEO addresses.
What is AEO?
Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the strategic discipline of getting your brand, product, and key differentiators featured inside AI search tools like:

ChatGPT
Perplexity
Claude
Gemini
And dozens of niche AI agents

While traditional SEO focuses on ranking in search results, AEO ensures you appear directly in the answers these LLM-powered tools provide users.
The RAISE Framework: Your Complete AEO System
Our battle-tested RAISE methodology consistently improves Answer Engine visibility:
R – Relevance Signals: Speak the Language of Answers
Last month, a mid-sized FP&A B2B SaaS company approached us with a problem: “We’re all over Google, but invisible in ChatGPT.” Their website was filled with beautiful marketing language that humans loved but AI completely ignored.
The issue became apparent when we ran a simple test. We asked ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity to recommend FP&A solutions for a mid-market manufacturing company. Their product never appeared—not even once.
Why? Because answer engines think in solutions, not superlatives.
When we rewrote their core pages to directly address specific scenarios rather than making vague claims about “transformation” and “innovation,” their visibility skyrocketed within three weeks.
❌ Ineffective: “Our platform empowers finance leaders with next-generation insights.”
✅ Effective: “Prophix is an FP&A platform that automates budget consolidation for mid-market companies, with native ERP integrations and AI-powered forecasting capabilities.”
This pattern repeats across every client we’ve worked with. Answer engines don’t care about your clever taglines—they care if you’re answering their users’ questions.
Key insight: Structure content like an expert directly answering questions. When you write like an answer, you become the answer.
A – Access Verification: Unlock Your Digital Doors
One enterprise client came to us baffled: “We’ve implemented our last SEO agency’s recommendations, but our visibility hasn’t improved at all.” After digging into their system, we discovered their security team had blocked all AI crawlers at the firewall level—the equivalent of locking your store and wondering why no customers came inside.
This happens more than you’d think. In our audit of 50 enterprise SaaS websites, 68% were inadvertently blocking at least one major AI crawler.
Step 1: Check server logs for these crawler signatures:
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; GPTBot/1.0)
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ClaudeBot/1.0)
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; PerplexityBot/1.0)



Step 2: Fix these common AEO barriers immediately:

Overly restrictive robots.txt (add explicit Allow directives)
Security measures (whitelist AI crawlers in WAF configs)
Progressive rendering issues (minimize JavaScript dependencies)

After implementing proper access protocols, our client saw their first-ever mentions in AI answers within days. Two weeks later, they appeared in 40% of targeted bottom-of-funnel queries.
Key insight: The most compelling content means nothing if AI can’t access it. Open your digital doors before worrying about what’s inside.
I – Information Density: Build Your AI Vocabulary
This principle became strikingly clear when working with competing products in the same category. One client consistently ranked in AI responses while their competitor, with more backlinks, domain authority, and SEO visibility, remained absent.
The difference? Information density.
The successful client systematically embedded a rich ecosystem of related terms, concepts, and specific use cases throughout their content. Their pages weren’t just longer—they were contextually richer.
For Prophix and similar FP&A tools, this means deliberately weaving in:

“Financial planning & analysis software”
“Cash flow forecasting and budget variance analysis”
“Integrations with Sage, Microsoft Dynamics, and NetSuite”
“Use cases for manufacturing financial modeling”
“Alternatives to Oracle Planning and Anaplan”
“SOC2 compliance and enterprise security features”
“KPIs like working capital ratio, DSO, and cash conversion cycle”

Key insight: Answer engines build associative networks. The richer your contextual signals, the more likely you’ll be pulled into relevant conversations.
S – Source Authority: Cultivate Your Digital Reputation
The most significant AEO success we’ve witnessed came from a cybersecurity company where we invested heavily in third-party validation and Digital PR while our team concurrently worked on their website’s product page, blog, and comparison page content.
They secured coverage in Gartner reports, industry publications, and professional forums. They methodically built profiles on review platforms, contributed to open discussions, and established a presence in every corner of their digital ecosystem.
When they finally launched their product pages, the answer engines already “knew” them as legitimate players because they had encountered the brand through trusted sources.
In the specific example for Prophix for prompts associated with finding FP&A tools, the authority checklist includes:

Gartner Magic Quadrants and Forrester Wave reports
G2 and Capterra with verified customer reviews
Finance community forums on Reddit and Quora
Publications like CFO.com and Financial Management
Industry analyst reports and case studies
Partner ecosystem marketplaces

Our data shows that brands appearing in at least 5 authority sources see 2.7x higher mention rates in AI answers compared to those relying primarily on their own websites.
Key insight: Answer engines trust established sources more than your claims about yourself. Build your reputation network before expecting AI recognition.
E – Engagement Feedback: Create Your Own Virtuous Cycle
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of AEO is how user behavior influences future results—a dimension traditional SEO simply doesn’t have.
We discovered this accidentally when a client’s sales team began regularly using ChatGPT to compare their product with competitors during calls. Within weeks, their specific comparison points began appearing in general AI responses about their category.
We’ve since formalized this into a deliberate strategy, creating “engagement campaigns” where employees, customers, and partners systematically prompt AI systems with questions where your brand deserves to be featured:

“What’s the best financial planning tool for manufacturing companies?”
“Compare Prophix vs Planful vs Workday Adaptive”
“Which FP&A tools integrate best with NetSuite?”

When combined with ensuring your content is accessible and relevant, these engagement loops create a compounding effect. One enterprise client saw their AEO visibility increase 4x after implementing a structured engagement program with just 30 participants.
Key insight: Answer engines learn from human feedback loops. Strategic prompting creates visibility momentum over time.
AEO Intelligence: Reverse Engineer Success
Perplexity reveals its sources, providing a window into effective Answer Engine Optimization. Search “best financial forecasting tools for mid-market” and analyze which sources appear. Is it a Gartner report? A specialist blog? A comparison site? Mirror what works.
The AEO Mandate: Act Now or Become Invisible
Let’s be clear: if your team views Answer Engine Optimization as experimental, you’re already losing deals you don’t know exist.
Anyone doing “comprehensive SEO” without AEO strategies is missing the boat. Internal teams waiting for “more data” before implementing Answer Engine Optimization are surrendering market position daily.
By Q1 2026, answer engines will influence 10-20% of all B2B software purchase decisions. The AEO visibility battle isn’t approaching—it’s already determining winners and losers.
The RAISE framework delivers measurable Answer Engine Optimization results today. Implement it now or explain to your board why competitors are capturing your market through channels you ignored.
The question isn’t whether AEO matters—it’s whether you’ll capitalize on it before your window closes.

Last month, a mid-sized FP&A B2B SaaS company approached us with a problem: “We’re all over Google, but invisible in ChatGPT.” Their website was filled with beautiful marketing language that humans loved but AI completely ignored.
The issue became apparent when we ran a simple test. We asked ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity to recommend FP&A solutions for a mid-market manufacturing company. Their product never appeared—not even once.
Why? Because answer engines think in solutions, not superlatives.
When we rewrote their core pages to directly address specific scenarios rather than making vague claims about “transformation” and “innovation,” their visibility skyrocketed within three weeks.
❌ Ineffective: “Our platform empowers finance leaders with next-generation insights.”
✅ Effective: “Prophix is an FP&A platform that automates budget consolidation for mid-market companies, with native ERP integrations and AI-powered forecasting capabilities.”
This pattern repeats across every client we’ve worked with. Answer engines don’t care about your clever taglines—they care if you’re answering their users’ questions.
Key insight: Structure content like an expert directly answering questions. When you write like an answer, you become the answer.
A – Access Verification: Unlock Your Digital Doors
One enterprise client came to us baffled: “We’ve implemented our last SEO agency’s recommendations, but our visibility hasn’t improved at all.” After digging into their system, we discovered their security team had blocked all AI crawlers at the firewall level—the equivalent of locking your store and wondering why no customers came inside.
This happens more than you’d think. In our audit of 50 enterprise SaaS websites, 68% were inadvertently blocking at least one major AI crawler.
Step 1: Check server logs for these crawler signatures:
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; GPTBot/1.0)
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; ClaudeBot/1.0)
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; PerplexityBot/1.0)



Step 2: Fix these common AEO barriers immediately:

Overly restrictive robots.txt (add explicit Allow directives)
Security measures (whitelist AI crawlers in WAF configs)
Progressive rendering issues (minimize JavaScript dependencies)

After implementing proper access protocols, our client saw their first-ever mentions in AI answers within days. Two weeks later, they appeared in 40% of targeted bottom-of-funnel queries.
Key insight: The most compelling content means nothing if AI can’t access it. Open your digital doors before worrying about what’s inside.
I – Information Density: Build Your AI Vocabulary
This principle became strikingly clear when working with competing products in the same category. One client consistently ranked in AI responses while their competitor, with more backlinks, domain authority, and SEO visibility, remained absent.
The difference? Information density.
The successful client systematically embedded a rich ecosystem of related terms, concepts, and specific use cases throughout their content. Their pages weren’t just longer—they were contextually richer.
For Prophix and similar FP&A tools, this means deliberately weaving in:

“Financial planning & analysis software”
“Cash flow forecasting and budget variance analysis”
“Integrations with Sage, Microsoft Dynamics, and NetSuite”
“Use cases for manufacturing financial modeling”
“Alternatives to Oracle Planning and Anaplan”
“SOC2 compliance and enterprise security features”
“KPIs like working capital ratio, DSO, and cash conversion cycle”

Key insight: Answer engines build associative networks. The richer your contextual signals, the more likely you’ll be pulled into relevant conversations.
S – Source Authority: Cultivate Your Digital Reputation
The most significant AEO success we’ve witnessed came from a cybersecurity company where we invested heavily in third-party validation and Digital PR while our team concurrently worked on their website’s product page, blog, and comparison page content.
They secured coverage in Gartner reports, industry publications, and professional forums. They methodically built profiles on review platforms, contributed to open discussions, and established a presence in every corner of their digital ecosystem.
When they finally launched their product pages, the answer engines already “knew” them as legitimate players because they had encountered the brand through trusted sources.
In the specific example for Prophix for prompts associated with finding FP&A tools, the authority checklist includes:

Gartner Magic Quadrants and Forrester Wave reports
G2 and Capterra with verified customer reviews
Finance community forums on Reddit and Quora
Publications like CFO.com and Financial Management
Industry analyst reports and case studies
Partner ecosystem marketplaces

Our data shows that brands appearing in at least 5 authority sources see 2.7x higher mention rates in AI answers compared to those relying primarily on their own websites.
Key insight: Answer engines trust established sources more than your claims about yourself. Build your reputation network before expecting AI recognition.
E – Engagement Feedback: Create Your Own Virtuous Cycle
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of AEO is how user behavior influences future results—a dimension traditional SEO simply doesn’t have.
We discovered this accidentally when a client’s sales team began regularly using ChatGPT to compare their product with competitors during calls. Within weeks, their specific comparison points began appearing in general AI responses about their category.
We’ve since formalized this into a deliberate strategy, creating “engagement campaigns” where employees, customers, and partners systematically prompt AI systems with questions where your brand deserves to be featured:

“What’s the best financial planning tool for manufacturing companies?”
“Compare Prophix vs Planful vs Workday Adaptive”
“Which FP&A tools integrate best with NetSuite?”

When combined with ensuring your content is accessible and relevant, these engagement loops create a compounding effect. One enterprise client saw their AEO visibility increase 4x after implementing a structured engagement program with just 30 participants.
Key insight: Answer engines learn from human feedback loops. Strategic prompting creates visibility momentum over time.
AEO Intelligence: Reverse Engineer Success
Perplexity reveals its sources, providing a window into effective Answer Engine Optimization. Search “best financial forecasting tools for mid-market” and analyze which sources appear. Is it a Gartner report? A specialist blog? A comparison site? Mirror what works.
The AEO Mandate: Act Now or Become Invisible
Let’s be clear: if your team views Answer Engine Optimization as experimental, you’re already losing deals you don’t know exist.
Anyone doing “comprehensive SEO” without AEO strategies is missing the boat. Internal teams waiting for “more data” before implementing Answer Engine Optimization are surrendering market position daily.
By Q1 2026, answer engines will influence 10-20% of all B2B software purchase decisions. The AEO visibility battle isn’t approaching—it’s already determining winners and losers.
The RAISE framework delivers measurable Answer Engine Optimization results today. Implement it now or explain to your board why competitors are capturing your market through channels you ignored.
The question isn’t whether AEO matters—it’s whether you’ll capitalize on it before your window closes.

Our Ideal Client

Wants to become a leader in their industry, but has challenges strategically acquiring prospects from digital channels, engaging them to stick around, and profitably converting them into their best customers.
Usually, this shows up in the form of missed targets, lack of buy-in from senior management, inadequate digital marketing investment, and confusion around clearly connecting digital marketing initiatives to a tangible return on investment.
Wants to hire us because of our expertise and objectivity (it’s unparalleled in our field) combining strategy, systems, and staff. We don’t take ourselves too seriously, but we take the results we drive for clients very seriously.

You are:

Willing to have us in the driver’s seat by inviting us to — decide which symptoms are relevant, diagnose the problem accurately, and prescribe the best solutions that can lead to real change but minimizes disruption as much as possible.
Quick to connect and share wins and challenges, and quick to implement recommendations.
Responsible for themselves. This means showing up on time, being prepared, and owning problems and solutions.
Value-focused and have no hesitation about the investment involved to turn their ideas into action, and confusion into clarity. You’ll happily grow with us as your own company grows because not hiring us is much more expensive than doing so.
Open to a different perspective on delivering work and communication, and is willing to try things out. We believe the best way to grow your marketing and sales is to be flexible and innovative.

The vast majority of our clients are our ideal clients, and we are fortunate and grateful to deliver a dream result together every single day.

The vast majority of our clients are our ideal clients, and we are fortunate and grateful to deliver a dream result together every single day.
They are smart, hard-working, funny, and they really care about doing a great job.
They’ve enabled us to become a multi-million dollar, self-funded digital consultancy, by growing with us, and by inviting new clients into Powered by Search so that we can spend more time working together, rather than looking for new clients.
Perhaps you’re our next big success story.

                                Own your traffic instead of renting it.
                                We help you lower your blended CAC by increasing your site’s domain authority and getting “page-2” positions into page 1.
This saves you money in the long run, and makes you more money by owning your traffic.

									FAQs
										You’ve probably got a lot of questions. The best way to get them answered is to reach out for your Free Marketing Plan. But here’s the answers to some of the most common questions just in case.
		
				
							
											
							What makes your link-building strategy unique for B2B SaaS companies?
						    
						    	Our strategy is bespoke, starting from scratch with every outreach to ensure genuine connections and collaborations. Unlike agencies relying on pre-existing lists, we focus on building a network effect that amplifies your brand’s voice across the digital landscape, ensuring each link contributes to your overall marketing objectives.

						    
					  	
											
							How do you measure the success of your link-building campaigns?
						    
						    	Success for us goes beyond traditional metrics. We align our efforts with your business goals, focusing on metrics that demonstrate real growth, such as higher SERP rankings, that lead to increased organic traffic to key “money” pages, and more trials and demos. Our content promotion roadmaps and strategies are crafted to ensure every link has a measurable impact on your bottom line.

						    
					  	
											
							Can you guarantee a certain number of links per month?
						    
						    	While we don’t guarantee an exact number of links, we guarantee a range of links that reflects the nature of our manual outreach. Our focus is on quality over quantity within the agreed range. We aim to secure valuable, high-impact links that align with your target audience and business objectives, rather than chasing arbitrary numbers.

						    
					  	
											
							How do you ensure the quality and relevance of the links?
						    
						    	Every link is the result of thorough research and strategic outreach. We target sites that are not only authoritative but also relevant to your industry and audience, ensuring that each link supports your brand’s credibility and visibility. We also don’t stop at domain-level metrics, but include page-level metrics in our strategy. This allows us to be more targeted and higher quality than 80% of agencies on the market.

						    
					  	
											
							What's your approach to avoiding and handling Google penalties?
						    
						    	Our practices are 100% white-hat, adhering strictly to Google’s Webmaster Guidelines. We prioritize ethical strategies that safeguard your site from penalties, focusing on building a sustainable, long-term SEO foundation.

						    
					  	
											
							How do you tailor your services for B2B SaaS companies?
						    
						    	Understanding that B2B SaaS companies have unique needs, we tailor our approach to match your sales cycle, customer journey, and business model. Our strategies are designed to boost the right content for your business. We also understand the challenges as well as the website structure and content type that most B2B SaaS companies adopt, and this helps us craft more effective outreach campaigns and messaging.

						    
					  	
											
							What's the typical timeline to see results from your link-building efforts?
						    
						    	SEO and link building are long-term strategies. While content production is a linear staircase, content promotion is an exponential scale. Timelines can vary, but clients typically begin to see notable improvements in organic traffic and rankings within 3-6 months of consistent link-building efforts.

															The individual issues that limit results for the B2B SaaS companies we work with vary widely.
For example, if it’s a search engine optimization (SEO) issue, companies experiencing similar outcomes can have entirely different things holding them back.
One might be experiencing technical issues like competing URLs. Another might be lacking comprehensiveness in their content. And another might simply need some link building to build authority.
The same goes with paid media. One company might be suffering from targeting and messaging issues. While another may have tracking and attribution errors. And yet another simply hasn’t found customer-channel fit.
However, while there are many individual errors and gaps that we help our clients solve, these are typically just symptoms of a deeper underlying problem. It’s the tendency for marketers to haphazardly string together a mix of outbound and inbound tactics, without intentionally syncing them together in a holistic strategy.
In short, their marketing is “tactics without strategy.” It’s like trying to navigate without a map. And it’s a sure fire way to hit a ceiling with your growth.

							
																												
							
							
							
							
						

						
					

				
			

		
		
		
	




	

					
									The Predictable Growth Methodology
													This is what led us to develop the Predictable Growth Methodology — our SaaS marketing strategy for increasing recurring revenue for demo and trial based B2B companies.
							
		
					
			
				
				
					
					
					

						
						
						
						
						

						

							
							
							
															
Instead of thinking of each tactic as their own individual effort, Predictable Growth helps SaaS marketers coordinate their tactics to ensure they’re working together — which helps them breach the growth ceilings they otherwise tend to run into.
It’s designed so that any B2B SaaS business, no matter what stage or state they are in, can systematically pinpoint their marketing problems and opportunities, and implement changes to grow revenue in a strategic way.

					There are no sustainable growth hacks.
Growth hacks are by nature, tactical.
Tricks that interrupt your prospects, newfangled landing page layouts, or killer copywriting words. Don’t forget “big data” and AI that magically increase your conversion rates at the click of a button.
Before our clients start working with us, they often talk about how they spent too much time, money, and effort in magic bullet type solutions, often going nowhere fast.
What would you rather have — A tactic that gets outdated so fast you don’t have enough time to find the next one… or a predictable, practical, and pragmatic process that is easy to understand and easy to deploy?
We designed the Predictable Growth methodology specifically for businesses that grow by getting more demos or free trials. It documents the exact process from getting someone who doesn’t know about your company to find you, and then become interested enough to want to talk to your sales team or to try your product before becoming a paying subscriber.
This process has worked selling products ranging from $1K ACV to $100K ACV (annual contract value). It is far from a magic bullet because it requires the combination of the strategy, tools, and talent (on our team and yours) to create lasting growth in any industry.
Our software and technology clients regularly see up to a 100% to 500% growth in their demo and trial acquisition, without diluting customer fit, and while reducing CPA (cost per acquisition)
In summary, our process works.
Step 1: Evaluating Your MRR Accelerators (so you know exactly what to optimize for growth)
Did you know that there are 7 other types of fit in scaling a software or technology business other than Product-Market fit?
Many founders believe that if they build a better product, the customers will come. That’s why they keep adding more features to the product to make it more ‘well-rounded’ so it appeals to a broader audience.
We believe that this approach stalls growth and increases the risk of building features that your ideal customers don’t want to pay for.
We believe that your marketing will impact far more people than your product ever will. That’s why we have identified the following areas of fit, which we call MRR Accelerators. Why accelerators? Because the tighter the fit, the faster you’ll demonstrably grow your monthly recurring revenue.
You can take the SaaS Scalability self-assessment to find out the gap between where your MRR is today, and what you’ll need to do to increase it to your target MRR.
Here’s why we believe working on your positioning, perfecting the conversation and content about your prospects’ pain points, and promoting the content you already have is crucial to growing your demos and trials:
You need to specifically uncover the weakest aspects of your current marketing strategy and understand why they aren’t working.
Most of our clients come to us with a specific idea of what they want us to work with them on first (eg: building an Adwords program, redesigning their website, or decreasing their Facebook Ads cost).
What we often find is that the initial ask while helpful, may not be the most important aspect to work to pursue first. The opportunities are hidden in the 7 other types of fit, ranging from fixing poor positioning, to appropriately funding a channel that was previously underfunded.
You don’t know why your current website visitors aren’t converting into more demos and trials.
Many of our clients come to us with a hunch about why their current website isn’t performing as they expect it to. They may see a competitor adopting a best practice they aren’t currently deploying into the market or having pursued a specific marketing channel (Facebook, Adwords, or SEO) without any success.
The truth is that without the data, these hunches aren’t good enough for you or your company. What you need is evidence that can pinpoint the chokepoints in your current customer journey.
You don’t click your own ads, read your own articles, or buy from your own website as a customer.
As a founder or marketer, it’s easy to think about your marketing funnel clinically, and therefore misdiagnose what’s missing or holding back ideal customers from converting into more demos or trials.
It’s difficult to have the same perspective, pain points, need for proof, or buying process as your customers do, and that’s precisely why it’s so important to understand.
Step 2: Understanding your Customer’s Intent and Pain Points
Everything you need to know to succeed at getting more demos and trials already exists within your company. We just need to take the information that sits fragmented between your product, engineering, customer success, and analytics teams and pull them together into an insightful narrative.
It’s not enough to just get everyone to meet (and that’s no small task), you need to be able to capture your team’s inputs into a meaningful canvas that can guide your marketing.
Seek to understand your customer’s Fears, Frustrations, Wants, and Aspirations. It’s important to think bigger than how your customers may use your product alone, because your solutions may small albeit value role in moving customers away from their fears and frustrations, and towards their wants and aspirations.
We’re trying to answer the question “what does my customer truly desire”? You’ll want to do this so that you can align the key aspects that make your products desirable to the key desires that your customers have.
Once you’ve identified the key topics that revolve around their problems, pain points, and desires, you’ll want to start diving deeper into keyword research that becomes the foundation of your key-driven channels like Organic Search (SEO), Google Adwords, or content channels like Youtube and Quora.
You’ll also want to identify the key alternatives your customers may resort to using if they weren’t to sign up for your product. Next, brainstorm why each of these is a worse off solution than your product suite. You should then pinpoint the exact benefit your target customer avatar will receive from using your product instead of the most apparent alternative.
Here’s an example from an actual client (name redacted for privacy)
So to summarize, here are the sub-steps:


Identify Your best customer’s global motivators (i.e their fears, frustrations, wants, and aspirations)


Identify key alternatives they may be using and why they are inferior to the value your product provides them.


Conduct keyword research after identifying the core topic areas of your customer’s problems, pain points, and desires.


Codify the key benefits your solution provides to the alternatives, competitors, and free solutions your future customers may be using.


Create a customer avatar that codifies your team’s joint input and drives future marketing strategy, content, and angles.


We’ve found that running a facilitated workshop that gets everyone building a deep customer avatar together has been the approach that yields the most success. If you’d like us to help you with this, contact us here.
Step 3: Pinpointing Why Your Visitors Aren’t Converting
Your visitors have a digital footprint that they leave every time they interact with your website. With the right approach to researching these footprints, you can trace their digital body language.
When you identify the exact places where the footprints stop in their tracks, you’ll find the conversion gaps in your website’s buyer journey.
The journey starts well-before the visitor ever lands on your website, so it’s important to trace back further to the origin point. For your company, this may include the following examples


An impression on a Google, Facebook, or Linkedin ad


A referral click from a review based website like G2 or Capterra


An organic search click to an article on your blog from Google


You can find all of this data in your analytics platform and in your CRM system.
If you don’t have this data handy or it isn’t tracked properly, contact us to discuss a project to track your data properly. 
You may be losing your best customers in the process because your website has some pretty predictable choke points. At Powered by Search we like to categorize these chokepoints into the following areas:
User Experience Issues
Have you ever wanted to complete a task on a website but found it difficult or impossible to do so? This is happening to your website’s visitors and holding you back from getting more demos and trials.
Here are some common areas you’ll want to investigate


Is your website fast enough to load on desktop and mobile devices?


Is your mobile website as usable as your desktop user experience?


Is it clear to visitors why they are on a given page, what they can do, how the described content on the page works, and what they should do next?


Do your forms ask for too much information too early in the buying process?


Do your forms work as expected with proper error handling?


Do visitors have to jump around your site to multiple different pages to get the information they need?


User Confusion
In order to have a high percentage of users who visit your website convert into demos and trials, you must present the right offer to the right prospect, at the right time.
Remember, a confused mind never buys.
We see many SaaS and Technology websites make the mistake of asking for the sale too early in the buyer engagement process (often as the only call to action on their home page). If this sounds like your website, you’re leaving a lot of money on the table.
At a high-level, you should be investigating the following areas:


Is your navigation clear and consistent without your users having to guess where to click?


Is it clear to users what will happen once they request a demo (i.e when it will be scheduled, how long it might be, and whether it’ll be customized to their needs)? If you are promoting free trials, is it clear if a credit card is required?


Does your website offer an alternative call to action to users who aren’t ready yet to request a demo or sign-up for a trial?


Are your call-to-actions congruent (i.e do they read the same) in the journey between your ads, your landing pages, and subsequent sign-up related pages?


Does your design use commonly accepted terminology, symbols, labels?


Value Proposition Friction
You lose potential customers when your website pitches the wrong offer to the wrong person at the wrong time.
Auditing your website for mismatches between the intention of the user, the stage of the buyer journey they’re at, and the key offers you’re making them can reveal some very profitable opportunities to grow MRR.
You can capture these mismatches in three ways:


Conduct a user experience experiment through a tool such as User Testing to observe how a potential ideal customer may complete or evaluate a key sequence of pages on your website.


Ask your website visitors for their input through micro-surveys that do not capture any personally identifiable data. We use RightMessage and Hotjar to ask users questions on key pages to understand their objections, issues, and satisfaction.


Interview newly converted customers to understand why they almost didn’t sign-up for trial or book a demo.


Once you have conducted your marketing research, the following litmus test is useful for optimizing your website’s value propositions.


Is your current copy including features, benefits, and value propositions well aligned with how your products help your ideal customer avatar move away from their fears and frustrations, and towards their wants and aspirations?


Are the control group’s value propositions the one’s ideal customers care about the most?


Is there a testing protocol or roadmap to refine and iterate copy and imagery for value propositions?


Does each page appropriately identify conversion blockers such as issues or objections and address them with benefits that ideal customers see as tangible and practical value drivers?


Does your conversion process have appropriate proof points including case studies, testimonials, awards, certifications, guarantees, and risk reversal?


(For example:  if you were to become a client, we will showcase strong case studies, testimonials, transparent processes (like you’re reading right now).
Step 4: Educating and Motivating Ideal Prospects
Your website’s visitors are at different stages of their buying journey. In order to guide them to becoming customers, you need to first educate them on why they should consider your company and products, and then motivate them to take the steps necessary to investigate fit and finally become a customer.
The best way to do this is through sharing content that elegantly guides a user from the first time they visit your website, to the point at which they start consuming your content, liking and trusting your company more, and finally converting into a sales-ready prospect or free trial user.
Your content must be original, authoritative, substantial, enjoyable, and accurate for you to sufficiently lay down the path for a visitor to convert into a paying customer.
When evaluating your own content, look for the following traps




Do you have too much ‘me too’ content that is derivative of what a quick google search in your niche might yield? You know you might be falling into this trap when you’re trying to increase the volume of publication at the expense of quality.


Does your content offer a strong point of view that aligns with your positioning? (i.e how you are meaningfully differentiated versus your competitors)


Do you have product pages that exist for the sake of existing (or because someone told you this was good for SEO; it isn’t)?


Do you have text boxes or content modules that leave the user with more questions than answers?




Would you read your own content or share it with a new hire within your company? 


Do you have a content review process to check for accuracy?


Many of Google’s recent algorithmic updates such as the EAT and Medic updates have negatively affected websites that did not take the content guidelines above seriously.
Step 5: Driving Right Fit Traffic through Paid and Organic Channels
Not all traffic is created equal. Your traffic maths need to work out so that you’re ROI positive, and the higher your ACV (annual contract value), the more you should be willing to pay on a cost per click basis to acquire traffic.
We define a right-fit click as a visitor who you have targeted specifically because they fall within your ideal customer avatar, either using targeting parameters in paid advertising platforms or by the means of writing an ad that attracts the ideal customer and repels those who aren’t.
We strongly advocate that every SEO initiative should first be validated by a Google Ads PPC campaign bidding on the same keywords that you intend on ranking for via SEO.
You can evaluate the quality of fit for your traffic by asking the following questions:


Is the channel the right fit for your target audience? For example, B2B audiences respond well to Google, Linkedin, Quora, and Twitter, but do not do as well on Reddit, Snapchat, or Spotify Ads.


Does traffic from this channel have a low exit rate or bounce rate?


Does traffic from this channel have a high conversion rate relative to other channels?


Is the cost of acquisition from this channel ROI positive?


If the ROI is positive from this channel, are you funding it appropriately (i.e spend more if it is positive, and spend less if it is not working)


Does your audience analytics (in Google Analytics, Facebook Audience Insights, or Linkedin Ads Insights) demonstrate a close overlap between actual visitors and your ideal customer avatar characteristics? (Aside: we’ve frequently found that many of our clients come to us thinking they’re targeting properly when in fact they’re attracting the wrong type of individual within their account-based marketing approach)


Does the channel drive enough volume to hit trial, MQL or SQL goals?


In our experience, most channels are complementary and non-zero-sum. This means that you can and should be investing in multiple channels to create an omnichannel traffic acquisition and conversion approach.
You should also be paying special attention to remarketing and how to meaningfully use it to win-back visitors who did not convert into a demo or trial on their first interaction. We’ve spoken at Google on the topic of doubling conversions using targeted remarketing.
Step 6: Creating a Proof of Concept Pilot Project
“Will it scale?” is a common trope in conference rooms across the world, and yet often this is exactly what kills your ability to scale. Instead, consider that if you can follow a process to turn a click into a customer exactly as intended, you can duplicate that process over and over again.
The Pilot Project is a simple, paired down version of your overall demand generation program. It’s meant to demonstrate the tight fit between 3 of the 8 different types of fit that accelerate MRR. It’s meant to get quick wins that create momentum that you can keep building on.
You’re going to go after the most immediate, highest-need audience. Keep in mind that these audiences will be the most hotly contested so you’ll only be decreasing your CPA (cost per acquisition) moving forwards.
Customer: Channel Fit — The objective is to test and learn from a few paid media channels to get benchmark metrics AND profitably drive demo or trial conversions. You will definitely want to test Google Adwords, and Facebook Ads and Instagram. You may optionally want to test Linkedin Ads if your LTV (lifetime value) is over $5000 and you have a payback period that is between 3-6 months (or less).
Customer: Content Fit  —  By dialling in customer: content fit, you’ll increase your conversion rate of turning anonymous visitors into known leads, capturing them into a database or ESP (email service provider).
You will drive clicks from paid media channels to a landing page where the user is able to receive valuable content (typically a guide, cheatsheet, whitepaper, or calculator) by opting in with as few pieces of information as possible. We recommend a first name and business email address because asking for fewer fields dramatically increases conversion rate.
Journey: Offer Fit — The objective is to take advantage of your newly converted MQL (marketing qualified lead) and to educate and motivate them to book a demo or to start a free trial. You shouldn’t waste the opportunity to do this on the thank you page of a content upgrade (some people call this a lead magnet).
Adopting the customer’s point of view, you’ll want to increase clarity, decrease confusion, and increase compelling elements of why the visitor should sign up for a trial or request a demo. In our experience, using video to explain key value propositions that are aligned with the intention that drove the user to download the content upgrade work best.
It’s natural to have many of the visitors who land on your thank you page drop off and not opt-in for starting a trial or requesting a demo. That’s why you’ll want to have a follow-up campaign (now that you have their email or phone number).
As part of our playbook, we send a follow-up email that is SPER (short, personable, expecting a response) that goes out from an SDR/BDR’s email or directly from the founder. The objective of the email is to start a conversation with the user who downloaded the content upgrade. This tactic alone is responsible for a significant bump in trial and demo requests.
If you’d like to work with us to run the pilot project for you, go ahead and claim your free SaaS Strategy Session to begin the process.
Step 7: Measuring Results, Generating Insights and Compounding Results
Too many marketers are misled by vanity metrics that don’t really have anything to do with growing your MRR. That’s us and our clients typically care about three directional metrics
MRR Velocity — Are you adding more MRR compared to last month and the month before that? The faster you can add MRR the more valuable your company will get, and the easier it will be to demonstrate traction that can be used for a funding round or for an exit.
To be specific, you’ll want to look at marketing’s contribution to overall MRR. You’ll only be able to do this if you’ve set up tracking, attribution, and analytics properly so that your analytics, marketing automation, and CRM platforms are all synced and talking to each other accurately.
If you have broken data, contact us for a data and analytics audit and we’d be happy to explore if and how we can help.
CAC Reduction — Your CAC is a function of your marketing and sales costs. Salaries are typically what causes the most sensitivity to your CAC trend. After labor, you’ll likely find that advertising dollars (i.e media spend) have the highest sensitivity (i.e the effect on the magnitude of change in your CAC).
To dramatically lower your marketing sourced CAC, while keeping sales team costs constant, you’ll want to optimize the following:


Invest in specialized and focused expertise (eg: hiring a consulting firm or agency) to augment your existing demand generation team’s abilities without adding multiple FTE’s who take between 3-6 months to ramp up.


Increase your conversion rate by dialling in your journey: offer fit. For example, if your conversion rate increases from 2% to 4% you’ll cut your marketing sourced CAC by nearly 50%.


Increase your conversion volume from lower average acquisition cost channels such as referral channels and through SEO. For example, one of the first things we do with SaaS clients is to build out robust product comparison pages for the bottom of funnel visitors trying to decide between our client’s product and that of competitors. We also create ‘alternative to ____’ pages that position our client’s products to users who are dissatisfied with competitors.


If your cost of acquisition for Demos and Trials is too high, contact us for a FREE SaaS Strategy session where we’d be happy to explore if and how we can help reduce your overall CAC.
LTV Growth 
Your best customers pay you more, stay with you longer, and refer more business to you. That’s why attracting right-fit customers is so important.
Many companies mistakenly attribute all of their LTV growth to a better product: market fit. That’s true on some level, but you can increase LTV by making no changes to the product at all, and by choosing a better more dialled market (i.e a different audience).
That’s the power of positioning. Often when we are approached by a SaaS company with a great product (i.e low monthly churn being a leading indicator) we get to work on improving their positioning because it is the foundation on which you can significantly accelerate demo and trial conversion.
Generating Insights vs Choking on Data
Too many of our incoming clients have accepted a low-bar for measuring their marketing, often relying on dashboards chock-full of data but devoid of a compelling narrative, and lackluster insights.
You need to derive insights by observing trends, patterns, and relationships in your data. Once you have insights, it’s important to check if they’re actually useful. Here’s the question we train marketers to ask:
“So what?”
The insight is only actionable if it definitely provides guidance on what you should be doing next to hit a predetermined goal or objective.
One tell-tale sign that your reports need an upgrade are ‘top 10’ reports. If the data remains mostly the same between reporting periods, then these types of reports are limited in their usefulness.
When we speak with senior clients or founders and ask “would you rather be interesting or useful”, they almost always answer “useful”.
Step 8: Creating your MRR acceleration roadmap (assigning what will happen when, and who will be responsible for results)
Even the best insight falls by without a proper plan to execute them to a high degree of success. Take all the insights you’ve generated and then prioritize them based on the following order:


The biggest impact changes in the shortest time frame


The easiest to deploy changes with the least dependencies


The most proven ideas based on past historical data (a.k.a if it’s worked before, do more of it again).


Once you’ve ranked the list you’ll need to assign them to the relevant teams. We highly recommend creating briefs that explain the best and worst-case outcomes of pursuing each initiative so that everyone on the team understands the stakes involved.
In our experience, the day to day of running a marketing operations team can often get in the way of these larger “important, not-urgent” initiatives. Here are a few project management approaches we use regularly to keep up the momentum:


Every initiative should have one Directly Responsible Individual.


Every initiative should be broken down into tasks. Each task shouldn’t take longer than a week to complete.


Every initiative should have a small project team (no more than 3-5 people ideally), where everyone is aware of who does what, and by when.


Conclusion
The Predictable Growth Methodology adds millions of dollars in $ARR (annual recurring revenue) for our clients every single year.

			Case studies

			How We Helped PointClickCare Get Over 2000 Leads with LinkedIn Ads
		
							
			
						
							
											The Challenge
						PointClickCare is the #1 cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform for long-term care.  Their platform enables health care providers, health systems, payers, and patients to confidently achieve the best possible outcomes by reducing manual data entry, duplication of data, and increasing data accuracy for patient care. Recently, PointClickCare has been named to the Forbes 2018 Cloud 100, the definitive list of the top 100 private cloud companies in the world, published by Forbes in collaboration with Bessemer Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures.
We’ve been working with PointClickCare for a few years, helping them fill their pipeline with more qualified demos so that they can scale their impact. Their business was quickly evolving to play at a bigger level, so their demand generation and product teams wanted to invest in new channels to get more leads and demos to fill their pipeline.
																The Solution
						In just under 2 quarters, we leveraged Linkedin Lead Gen ads to generate 1208 new Skilled Nursing leads, 311 new Senior Living leads, and 544 new Home Care leads.
We used a combination of static, in-feed, and video ads to ensure their target audiences were engaged, preventing any ad fatigue.
We also evaluated their existing e-books and guides for content-customer fit, and upon realizing that they were long and hard to consume, turned them into shorter more digestible content by breaking down the e-books into smaller guides, or simply changing the name from e-books to guide/cheat sheets.
																The Results
						
Drove 2063 leads at a cost of only $10 per lead in the highly competitive healthcare niche
Used Linkedin Lead Gen ads to convert highly targeted ideal client avatars into MQLs.
Collaborated with PointClickCare to turn longer content upgrades into short, actionable, goal-oriented, and easy to consume cheatsheets.
Achieved a 24% opt-in rate proving high customer-offer fit.

															Choosing a marketing agency is daunting: you’re on the hook for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars if you make the wrong choice.
So let us explain why Powered by Search is a great investment and why we’re a safe choice compared to some of the other agencies you may be considering.

															You’ve heard other agencies say ‘we’re different’ but how believable is that really?
They might get some good results, sure. But it’s a nightmare to work with them.
You’ve got no visibility on how the project is going, whether you’ll hit your goals or how they’re going to make that happen.

                                We only work with B2B SaaS. Nothing else.
                                Almost every agency claiming to help grow B2B SaaS companies also makes the same claim about ecommerce, DTC and service businesses.
But Powered by Search only works with B2B SaaS companies with demonstrable product-market fit who are ready to scale trials and demos at record breaking speeds.
Because of this deep expertise in the SaaS business model, we know exactly how to grow businesses – and we have the results to prove it.

              Expert Advice            
                                Work with consultants. Not juniors
                                “Will my account get assigned to an inexperienced junior?”
If you’ve worked with agencies before, you’ll know that once the handshake is done and the ink is wet, you’ll be passed off to an implementation team. Day to day you end up working with a junior and you’re left looking at the table where the senior consultants are sat shaking their next client’s hand.
We only work with experienced consultants who are able to think strategically and translate your business goals into marketing programs.
Our directors work with their teams to define the strategy for each account, implement and stay on top of the performance. Because of the way we use Basecamp to communicate, even our executive team see the day-to-day performance and quality of your project.
So, no. We won’t palm you off on an inexperienced junior and then go find our next client.

                                      

      
  
                  
  

  
            
                        
  
      
        
                                
                
              Conversion Driven            
                                Revenue focused. Not vanity metrics
                                When you’re signing off on a project with an agency, you want to know you’re going to see ROI.
Lots of agencies will tell you that you’ll see increased traffic, lower cost per lead and improved search rankings.
But we give you forecasts for growth including expected traction, acquisition cost estimates, and business cases for appropriate funding.
Maybe you’ve been burned by agencies reporting on vanity metrics like impressions or CTR in the past. We don’t work like that.
We’re focused on driving improvement in bottom line metrics first and foremost. Trials, activations, closed deals. That’s what we care about.

                                
                              Who manages my account?
                
                  Unlike other agencies, we don’t have account managers.
Every account at Powered by Search is managed by a lead consultant for each channel that we’re working on. For example, Pedro could be the lead consultant for SEO and work with Jess as the lead consultant on paid media and Andrew can manage the demand gen elements of your project.
                
                          
                            

      
  
                  
  
      
                
          
        


      
  
                  
  

  
            
                        
  
      
                
          
        


      
  
                  
  
      
        
                                
                
              Awareness Aligned            
                                Systematic playbook for driving growth
                                Ever get the feeling that an agency doesn’t really know what the next move is? Or why something works? 
Ever feel like they say ‘it’s best practice’ or ‘we’ve seen this work’ without any kind of understanding of why? 
It’s deeply frustrating when that happens.
Because of our deep B2B SaaS experience, we have a clear and systematic playbook for growing business predictably. It’s called the predictable growth model.
We work through improving the efficacy of the levers you can pull to grow your company and prioritize actions based on clearly defined goals.
Here’s what our client had to say about how we helped Loopio increase demos by 41% quarter over quarter and achieve consistent growth:
“There’s always a scientific methodology around the things that they initiate and the ‘why’ behind the initiatives. They always tie their suggestions back to how each initiative will achieve our end goals”
– Marcus Di Rollo, Loopio

                                      

      
  
                  
  

  
            
                        
  
      
        
                                
                
              Highly Strategic            
                                Strategic partners, not marketing bods
                                The classic adage is: ‘the customer is always right’ and most marketing agencies work off that principle too.
But it’s wrong.
When you’re sick and go to a surgeon for an operation, you don’t direct their scalpel during the operation. That would be madness.
Our consultants have worked on dozens of businesses trying to do similar things to you. They know what works, why and when to make the sometimes uncomfortable call to say: ‘Here’s why this wouldn’t be in your best interest’
When you hire Powered By Search, you’re not hiring a team to pull levers for you. You’re hiring partners who can help you make strong strategic choices that align to actual business goals.
Clients frequently tell us they’re fed up of needing to tell their agencies what to do and that they want their agency to to tell *them* what to do.
We do that and one better: We do it for them so all they have to pay for is the result.
But if you’re after a team who’ll take orders and run your ad accounts without question, we’d be happy to send you a list of names.

                                ThreatX hired Powered by Search to help them build a strong pipeline for a privacy focused market with long sales cycles.
We used paid media and SEO to build awareness so that when they’re ready to buy, ThreatX is the obvious choice.
Neil DuPaul, Senior Director, Demand Gen at Threat X said:

                                          
                                          “One of the things that can help you is an established framework like Powered by Search has about what B2B buyers prioritize and when they prioritize them. Everyone internally talks about mapping content to the buyer stages. But few agencies can really execute on the content that will actually drive next step demo requests in the way Powered by Search can.”

		About UsWe help B2B Technology & SaaS Companies who aren’t growing fast enough.
Do you feel like you have to create your digital marketing strategy all by yourself, or that finding the right team members is nearly impossible?
Are you frustrated that you aren’t growing as fast as you know you should be, even though your products are demonstrably better than your competitors?
Are you running into the same problems month after month, putting out fires because you’re either having problems attracting the right traffic, converting them into right demos or trials, or effectively tracking and attributing marketing’s impact on keeping your sales teams productive?
If that’s you, you’re in the right place because you are not alone.
Startup graveyards are filled with companies that have a great product that just wasn’t marketed well. We fix that problem.
Our mission is to help experts like you to scale your B2B software or technology company at will with the perfect combination of demand generation strategy, content marketing, and paid advertising, and SEO.
Why do our clients hire us?

We have worked with businesses just like yours. Since 2009 we have helped B2B software and technology clients dominate competitive industries in verticals including insurance, finance, legal, healthcare, logistics, shipping, manufacturing, network security, cloud computing, and investor relations. There’s too many to list right here, so if you’re curious if we’ve got experience in your vertical just ask us.
We demonstrate tangible results in 90 days or less. Many of our clients come to us after working with agencies or consultants who take too long to figure out their business, increasing the time it takes to generate results.
We have a proven methodology and strategy, and ruthlessly execute on exactly what’s needed to get your ideal prospect who may have never heard of your company to become so interested in your products that they request a demo or sign up for a free trial.

We hire, fire, and promote based on the following values.
The company we’ve built is the function of the team we have and the client we work with.
These are our core values:

Always be in it to win it.
Give a shit.
Be obsessed with serving others.
Practice a growth mindset.
When we fail, don’t lose the lesson.

How our team gets results
Powered by Search is a global team of fully distributed and remote-first with consultants globally in 8+ countries across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Our team specializes in organic and paid traffic acquisition, creating compelling copywriting and offers, and creating and promoting content that speaks to your ideal prospects and customers.
Our clients tell us that they love our approach of connecting clients and specialized consultants directly, eliminating the middleman, or account management function so common in other agencies.
This approach not only saves time and increases output because it’s more efficient — you get to work directly with experts and enjoy an engagement that goes deep fast, with specific, actionable, and pragmatic guidance.
Our consultants have experience working and managing in-house marketing teams, leading agency-side teams, and running their own successful consulting practices and have worked with software and technology clients for many years.
This means we understand the practical reality of marketing operations within a B2B software or technology business. We know that before we celebrate wins, you’ll need a solid strategy to work with your counterparts in IT, Legal, and Sales to holistically grow your business.
That’s why we will work with you to identify your own unique style and constraints upfront so that you only get guidance and road-mapped solutions that can be executed fast.

						Most B2B SaaS marketers construct a marketing strategy by selecting a handful of channels based on two factors:

The teams’ personal experience and expertise in a particular marketing channel 
The marketing channels competitors are using

However, a marketing strategy is fundamentally a method to attract ideal prospects and convert them into customers.
Therefore, an effective marketing strategy is built around how the prospect experiences the buyer journey.
The marketing channels incorporated into the strategy are simply the touchpoints a prospect organically uses to research, evaluate, and select a solution.
In this post, we’ll discuss the most popular marketing channels (as that’s often the main topic of conversation when discussing a marketing strategy).
However, unlike most marketing strategy content, which simply provides best practice advice for executing each channel, we’ll answer the two most important questions:

When is the right time to invest in this channel?
If you’re already investing in the channel, what are the common mistakes that most SaaS companies make, resulting in average performance?  

At the end of this post, we’ll also discuss how we create a SaaS marketing foundation and build a flywheel that makes each channel progressively more effective.
The 9 Most Important SaaS Marketing Channels 
Here are the nine most important SaaS marketing channels that we frequently execute for clients.
1. SEO
Should SaaS companies invest in SEO in 2025? 
We frequently receive this question from SaaS companies, and given the rise of LLMs and the fact that Google’s AI overviews are reducing website traffic, it’s certainly a valid concern. 
First, LLMs like ChatGPT are indeed capturing a significant percentage of traffic, but Google still holds a substantially larger market share than any other LLM. 

Additionally, while Google’s AI overviews are significantly reducing website clicks, Google search still drives plenty of qualified leads for our clients.
Yes, top of funnel traffic is decreasing, but conversions remain strong.
The key is to shift your thinking from optimizing for traffic (which we’ve always believed is a flawed metric given that it doesn’t always correlate with conversions) and instead:

Use conversions and leads as the core KPI to measure content success.
Shift leading indicators from generic traffic to rankings for high purchase intent keywords.

We have a more detailed guide discussing our SaaS SEO playbook, but our core philosophy on SEO is to shift the focus from volume to impact. 
From a tactical perspective, here’s how we shift focus from chasing traffic to maximizing conversions:

If you want to learn more about how we tactically implement our SaaS SEO playbook, here’s a brief overview: 

Create: Prioritize high-intent, conversion-ready keywords. Refresh existing content rather than always writing new content.
Structure: Align site architecture, content, and CTAs to seamlessly connect each stage of the buyer journey.
Promote: Earn high-quality, contextual links to pages that drive conversions by building relationships with relevant industry leaders.
Integrate: Break down silos between content, SEO, and link-building teams. Focus all efforts on boosting pages that contribute to demos and revenue.

2. Content Marketing
You can have the best technical SEO in the world, but it won’t drive any traffic if you don’t have information addressing a prospect’s search questions. 
Therefore, content marketing is essential for every SaaS company.
A better question is:
How much should we be investing in content marketing, especially if our current strategy isn’t yielding results?
The answer to this question depends on two variables:

If you have content targeting all of your highest converting (BOFU) keywords
The quality and rankings of the content targeting those keywords.

For reference, the highest converting (BOFU) keywords we’re looking for follow these four frameworks:

Comparison pages (e.g., “Your SaaS vs Competitor”)
“Alternative to” pages
“best” (industry/persona) software
Pain points your most popular features solve

After identifying the keywords that fit those frameworks, we prioritize updating content that’s already within striking distance (e.g., positions 4-15 for the main keyword).
Why start with content within striking distance?
CTRs increase significantly as you move up even just a few spots on the first page, so targeting this low hanging fruit will give you the biggest immediate lift:

Once we’ve updated all those keywords, we’ll move down the list and refresh content that targets high-intent keywords but ranks below position 15 for the target keyword.
Finally, we’ll move on to creating new content for the remaining high-intent keywords on the list. 
To refresh the content, we interview thought leaders to craft unique insights that allow it to stand out from generic and AI content. (We’ll also build links to these pages, but more on that later.)
Additionally, we optimize the blog design to capture and retain a greater percentage of traffic. 
Specifically, most visitors aren’t ready to sign up for a demo the first time they land on your website. Therefore, instead of leaving just a generic CTA to book a demo, we create offers relevant to each stage of the buyer journey to retain maximum traffic.
3. Digital PR and Link Building
Your content marketing efforts won’t move the needle if nobody sees your content. Even if you refresh existing content, you might not have enough page authority to outrank your competitors. 
Digital PR and link building can solve this problem.
That said, if you’ve ever tried running a link building campaign, you know that most campaigns have very low response rates and don’t meaningfully move the needle.
The problem is that most of these link building campaigns lack targeted goals. They’re building links to the generic homepage from any website with a high domain authority. 
Instead, here are a few principles that make our digital PR and link building effective:

Build links to high converting pages in “striking distance” rather than the homepage
Select link partners based on page authority, traffic, and other metrics rather than generic domain authority.
Reach out to the right person with an offer that makes their life easier rather than a generic request.

Here’s a full overview of our methodical approach to link building and digital PR:

4. AEO
“How do we show up in ChatGPT?”
The answer to this question is AEO – Answer Engine Optimization.
AEO is a strategy to rank higher in modern AI search tools, such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and dozens of niche AI agents.
First, having a strong SEO foundation (and a strong brand) certainly helps. However, there are important nuances that make AEO unique.
So, in addition to executing SEO, we also implement the RAISE framework. We outline this framework in more detail in our guide to ranking in LLMs.

 
5. Facebook Ads 
While it may not be the first platform that comes to mind for B2B SaaS, Facebook Ads can be a powerful platform if your audience is active on the platform and matches one of its specific target audiences.
For example, we worked with a B2B SaaS whose target audience was restaurant owners. While only some of these restaurant owners are active on LinkedIn, many of them have Facebook profiles. And, Facebook allowed us to target restaurant owners directly.
This ultra specific targeting made Facebook a highly effective channel for not only generating brand awareness, but also generating qualified leads.
Even if your audience is primarily on LinkedIn, Facebook is excellent for retargeting and general brand awareness campaigns.
If you’ve tried Facebook ads before and it hasn’t worked, it’s usually due to one of these three issues:

Imprecise targeting
Insufficient creative testing
Neglecting on platform lead generation

Beyond simply executing best practices for Facebook ads, here’s the 80/20 of successful Facebook advertising:

For more detailed information, we have a dedicated resource outlining our approach to running Facebook ads for B2B SaaS, and explain each step in more detail. 
6. ABM
ABM (account based marketing) is ideal for B2B SaaS companies that sell to enterprise or mid-market buyers with long sales cycles, as it allows you to target specific people within a target company.
While ABM is a powerful tool, many prospects tell us that it’s too expensive and doesn’t convert well enough. 
In these cases, we typically find that the company is making one of the following three mistakes.

Exclusively using firmographic data for targeting: Just because a company fits your ICP doesn’t mean they’re actively looking for a solution. Only target in-market accounts that show real purchase intent. You can use intent platforms like 6sense, Bombora, or Demandbase to identify in-market prospects.


Running ABM like a generic demand gen campaign: A key reason ABM ads can deliver outstanding results is that you know exactly who you’re targeting and can therefore deliver a hyper-personalized message that speaks to their specific pain points.
Ignoring the prospect’s stage in the buyer journey: If your buyer journey lasts six, twelve, or eighteen months, a message that resonated in month one likely won’t resonate at month 12. Calibrate your messaging to match the prospect’s stage in the buyer journey.

ABM campaigns are more complex to set up, so here’s our five-step ABM process. However, once you have them set up and follow the blueprint, ABM is very powerful for B2B SaaS companies selling to enterprises.
7. LinkedIn
LinkedIn ads are a staple for many B2B SaaS companies because they allow you to target key decision makers by job title, industry, company size, and other filters that aren’t available on Google or Facebook.
Therefore, we typically use LinkedIn ads if:

You sell to enterprise or mid-market companies.
Your buying committee includes multiple decision-makers.
Your sales cycle is long and complex.
You already have strong positioning and messaging dialed in.

If you’ve tried LinkedIn and it hasn’t yielded a great ROI, it might be due to one of these three common mistakes:

Exclusively targeting bottom of funnel prospects: Most enterprise buying cycles last about 12 or more months. If a prospect learns about your product after they’ve already talked to several other brands, it’s unlikely they’ll consider your product. 
Inaccurate targeting: SaaS companies often misuse the “AND” and “OR” functionality in LinkedIn targeting. Similarly, only targeting one person involved in the buying committee won’t get you the buy-in you need to close a deal. 
Using the wrong content at the wrong time: Someone at the top of the funnel might not be interested in a case study whereas someone at the bottom of the funnel is probably too advanced for a basic checklist. 

We have a detailed LinkedIn ads playbook for B2B SaaS, but here’s a brief synopsis of our approach:

8. Google Ads
Google Ads are another staple of B2B SaaS marketing, and they’re unique from paid social channels because you’re bidding on keywords, not an individual’s title, company, or characteristics. 
By bidding on keywords, you can pinpoint people who are in-market by reverse engineering the intent behind a specific keyword.
To help you identify the right keywords and allocate budget appropriately, here are the keyword frameworks we recommend for B2B SaaS companies: 

To further improve the performance of your Google ads, here are some additional best practices we recommend in our SaaS Google Ads playbook:

Use Three RSAs Per Ad Group: If you’re only rotating one or two ads per ad group, you simply don’t give the platform sufficient opportunities to improve conversion rates. 
Sitelink and Callout Extensions: These give you more real estate in the search result and encourage prospects to take action while also reducing the visibility of your competitors. 
Dedicated Landing Pages: We often see SaaS companies drive prospects to a generic homepage. Instead, send them to a dedicated landing page that matches their stage in the buyer journey and offers a calibrated call to action.
Exclude Existing Customers: Create a list of existing customers and exclude these people from brand query campaigns. In most cases, it makes more sense to upsell existing customers through email and other cheaper methods.

9. Email Marketing
When used appropriately, email marketing can be a highly effective strategy to nurture prospects and increase the LTV of existing customers. 
However, simply sending emails doesn’t mean your email marketing is effective. 
Most companies are making one of the following mistakes:

Sending one off emails instead of sequences.
Emailing generic lists rather than segmenting the audience.
Copywriting that doesn’t speak to the customer’s pain points

To solve for these problems, we have a handful of specific email nurture sequences that we implement for three of our B2B SaaS clients:

Nurture campaigns: The goal of these campaigns is to convert prospects into MQLs. Specifically, we have templates for lead to MQL sequences, trial welcome sequences, and pre-demo/pre-webinar welcome sequences. 
Activate: These campaigns are sent to current customers and are designed to either upsell them or educate them on how to use your product more effectively. 
Revive: Not all churned customers are a poor fit for your brand. Depending on the reason a customer churned, you can send them a revival email to win back their business.

We have a more detailed guide outlining our full SaaS email marketing strategy, along with execution tips.
Why a Collection of Marketing Channels Is NOT A SaaS Marketing Strategy 
Many of the underperforming SaaS marketing strategies we audit have great tactical execution. 
The root of the problem often lies in the team’s fundamental approach to building a marketing strategy.
Specifically, they’ll analyze the marketing channels their competitors are using and then execute similar campaigns.
The problem with this approach is twofold:

Pain point misalignment
Disconnected user experience

Pain Point Misalignment
You probably know the basic problems your customers face. If you’re a cybersecurity software provider, security is the obvious pain point. 
Yet there are three specific nuances to pain point alignment:

Committee member: An end user often cares about making their job easier, whereas a check signer cares about ROI and organizational impact. You must know which member of the buying committee you’re addressing.
Timing: At the beginning of the buyer journey, the pain point is more general – identifying a secure solution. At the end of the buyer journey, the pain point is more specific – how is Cybersecurity A better than Cybersecurity B? Does it offer Feature XYZ to prevent a specific type of attack?
Accuracy: You might think people are buying your cybersecurity solution for a specific feature, yet they might actually choose you because your customer support is superior. However, if you don’t use qualitative and quantitative data to identify these reasons, you’ll never know. As a result, messaging around your special feature won’t convert.

Disconnected user experience
Prospects don’t conform to the buyer journey you lay out. To effectively attract, convince, and convert prospects, you must construct a marketing channel that aligns with how they experience the journey.
Specifically, this means:

Your CTA must be calibrated to their stage of the buyer journey: We often see SaaS companies offer a CTA to schedule a demo, yet if the prospect is in the problem awareness stage, they aren’t ready for a demo. The CTA instead needs to offer a smaller ask, like a free calculator or template.
The messaging on the next channel must be congruent with the previous channel: We often see SaaS companies have messaging targeting a slightly different pain point from one touchpoint to the next. It may be very slight – as simple as incorrect timing of a correct pain point. However, even a slight disconnection in messaging can cause a prospect to exit the buyer journey.

In short, a collection of tactically flawless marketing campaigns is not an effective marketing strategy. 
The solution to building a profitable marketing strategy is taking a data-driven, holistic approach that meets prospects where they’re at and provides the knowledge they need to overcome objections and convert. 
This is the fundamental principle behind our Predictable Growth Methodology, which is the cornerstone of our marketing philosophy here at Powered by Search.
How To Build a Sustainable SaaS Marketing Strategy
The Predictable Growth Methodology is a systematic approach that creates a flywheel where each marketing initiative builds on the previous efforts, making the overall strategy progressively more efficient. 
Here’s how it works.
Step 1: Evaluate Your MRR Accelerators
Identify the seven types of “fit” beyond product-market fit that impact monthly recurring revenue growth. For example, Message-Market Fit, Customer-Channel Fit, and Customer-Content Fit are all “fits” that impact the efficacy of your marketing, and therefore, your revenue.
Audit your marketing strategy by combing through each of these “fits” and uncover the weakest points.
Note: As you’re auditing your marketing strategy, use real data – not assumptions.
You can also understand why website visitors aren’t converting by analyzing data from your customers’ perspective, rather than relying on internal assumptions.
Step 2: Understand Customer Intent and Pain Points
Assuming you know who your best customers are and their pain points is dangerous. 
Yes, you probably generally know who is buying your product, but do you know:

Every title involved in the buyer journey (Who brought it up first in the company? It isn’t just the check signer)
Which channel did they find you through? (You might see leads from LinkedIn ads, but it was actually a blog post the saw earlier that first made them interested in your company.)
Why they chose your product over the competition? (You might think it’s feature-related, but they might say it’s because your customer service is better.)

Answer these questions with data.
Specifically, we gather qualitative data from product, engineering, customer success, and analytics teams. 
We also gather data from the CRM and sales calls to better understand pain points and how they phrase them (this will impact your messaging). 
Step 3: Pinpoint Visitor Conversion Issues
Analyze why current website visitors aren’t converting into demos and trials. Look in your CRM to see which lead magnets perform the best and which ones have not been successful.
Look at Google Analytics to identify where users leave your website. These insights are essential for tying together the customer journey.
Step 4: Educate and Motivate Ideal Prospects
Publish content and messaging that addresses your prospects’ specific needs and pain points, and guides them towards a demo or trial.
If you’re only targeting bottom of the funnel visitors, you’ll see low conversion rates. Remember that enterprise purchases are considered purchases and don’t happen overnight. Therefore, you can’t expect to show up in a prospect’s feed at the last minute and win their business.
Step 5: Drive Right-Fit Traffic
Implement both paid and organic marketing campaigns to attract visitors who are most likely to convert into qualified prospects and eventually paying customers.
For this stage, you can use a tool like SparkToro to identify the channels your best customers use to research problems and discover solutions. Then, run campaigns on those channels. 
Step 6: Creating a Proof of Concept Pilot Project
Instead of questioning whether your strategy will scale, focus on proving that you can turn a click into a customer through a repeatable process. 
The Pilot Project is a simplified version of your demand generation program targeting your highest-value audience. 
It tests three critical fits: 

Customer-Channel Fit (testing paid channels like Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram, and optionally LinkedIn for high-LTV products)
Customer-Content Fit (converting visitors to leads through valuable content like guides or calculators with minimal form fields)
Journey-Offer Fit (using thank-you pages and follow-up campaigns to convert leads into demos/trials). 

This approach generates quick wins and momentum while establishing benchmark metrics and reducing the cost per acquisition over time.
Step 7: Measure and Generate Insights
Many marketers use vanity metrics to measure the efficacy of their marketing campaigns. We tie actions to ROI.
Specifically, look at:

MRR Velocity
CAC Reduction
LTV Growth 

Step 8: Create Your MRR Acceleration Roadmap
After you’ve had time to gather some data, prioritize initiatives using three criteria: 

Highest impact adjustments in the shortest timeframe, 
Simplest to deploy changes with minimal dependencies
Most proven ideas based on historical success. 

Once you’ve prioritized initiatives, assign them to relevant teams with detailed briefs explaining best and worst-case outcomes. 
Here’s exactly how we approach project management to ensure these initiatives are executed:

Assign each initiative to a Directly Responsible Individual.
Break down initiatives into actionable tasks that take less than a week to complete.
Ensure initiatives have a small project team (3-5 people) and everyone knows who does what and by when.

This process ensures that these “important, but not urgent” tasks are completed.

Running ABM like a generic demand gen campaign: A key reason ABM ads can deliver outstanding results is that you know exactly who you’re targeting and can therefore deliver a hyper-personalized message that speaks to their specific pain points.
Ignoring the prospect’s stage in the buyer journey: If your buyer journey lasts six, twelve, or eighteen months, a message that resonated in month one likely won’t resonate at month 12. Calibrate your messaging to match the prospect’s stage in the buyer journey.

ABM campaigns are more complex to set up, so here’s our five-step ABM process. However, once you have them set up and follow the blueprint, ABM is very powerful for B2B SaaS companies selling to enterprises.
7. LinkedIn
LinkedIn ads are a staple for many B2B SaaS companies because they allow you to target key decision makers by job title, industry, company size, and other filters that aren’t available on Google or Facebook.
Therefore, we typically use LinkedIn ads if:

You sell to enterprise or mid-market companies.
Your buying committee includes multiple decision-makers.
Your sales cycle is long and complex.
You already have strong positioning and messaging dialed in.

If you’ve tried LinkedIn and it hasn’t yielded a great ROI, it might be due to one of these three common mistakes:

Exclusively targeting bottom of funnel prospects: Most enterprise buying cycles last about 12 or more months. If a prospect learns about your product after they’ve already talked to several other brands, it’s unlikely they’ll consider your product. 
Inaccurate targeting: SaaS companies often misuse the “AND” and “OR” functionality in LinkedIn targeting. Similarly, only targeting one person involved in the buying committee won’t get you the buy-in you need to close a deal. 
Using the wrong content at the wrong time: Someone at the top of the funnel might not be interested in a case study whereas someone at the bottom of the funnel is probably too advanced for a basic checklist. 

We have a detailed LinkedIn ads playbook for B2B SaaS, but here’s a brief synopsis of our approach:

8. Google Ads
Google Ads are another staple of B2B SaaS marketing, and they’re unique from paid social channels because you’re bidding on keywords, not an individual’s title, company, or characteristics. 
By bidding on keywords, you can pinpoint people who are in-market by reverse engineering the intent behind a specific keyword.
To help you identify the right keywords and allocate budget appropriately, here are the keyword frameworks we recommend for B2B SaaS companies: 

To further improve the performance of your Google ads, here are some additional best practices we recommend in our SaaS Google Ads playbook:

Use Three RSAs Per Ad Group: If you’re only rotating one or two ads per ad group, you simply don’t give the platform sufficient opportunities to improve conversion rates. 
Sitelink and Callout Extensions: These give you more real estate in the search result and encourage prospects to take action while also reducing the visibility of your competitors. 
Dedicated Landing Pages: We often see SaaS companies drive prospects to a generic homepage. Instead, send them to a dedicated landing page that matches their stage in the buyer journey and offers a calibrated call to action.
Exclude Existing Customers: Create a list of existing customers and exclude these people from brand query campaigns. In most cases, it makes more sense to upsell existing customers through email and other cheaper methods.

9. Email Marketing
When used appropriately, email marketing can be a highly effective strategy to nurture prospects and increase the LTV of existing customers. 
However, simply sending emails doesn’t mean your email marketing is effective. 
Most companies are making one of the following mistakes:

Sending one off emails instead of sequences.
Emailing generic lists rather than segmenting the audience.
Copywriting that doesn’t speak to the customer’s pain points

To solve for these problems, we have a handful of specific email nurture sequences that we implement for three of our B2B SaaS clients:

Nurture campaigns: The goal of these campaigns is to convert prospects into MQLs. Specifically, we have templates for lead to MQL sequences, trial welcome sequences, and pre-demo/pre-webinar welcome sequences. 
Activate: These campaigns are sent to current customers and are designed to either upsell them or educate them on how to use your product more effectively. 
Revive: Not all churned customers are a poor fit for your brand. Depending on the reason a customer churned, you can send them a revival email to win back their business.

We have a more detailed guide outlining our full SaaS email marketing strategy, along with execution tips.
Why a Collection of Marketing Channels Is NOT A SaaS Marketing Strategy 
Many of the underperforming SaaS marketing strategies we audit have great tactical execution. 
The root of the problem often lies in the team’s fundamental approach to building a marketing strategy.
Specifically, they’ll analyze the marketing channels their competitors are using and then execute similar campaigns.
The problem with this approach is twofold:

Pain point misalignment
Disconnected user experience

Pain Point Misalignment
You probably know the basic problems your customers face. If you’re a cybersecurity software provider, security is the obvious pain point. 
Yet there are three specific nuances to pain point alignment:

Committee member: An end user often cares about making their job easier, whereas a check signer cares about ROI and organizational impact. You must know which member of the buying committee you’re addressing.
Timing: At the beginning of the buyer journey, the pain point is more general – identifying a secure solution. At the end of the buyer journey, the pain point is more specific – how is Cybersecurity A better than Cybersecurity B? Does it offer Feature XYZ to prevent a specific type of attack?
Accuracy: You might think people are buying your cybersecurity solution for a specific feature, yet they might actually choose you because your customer support is superior. However, if you don’t use qualitative and quantitative data to identify these reasons, you’ll never know. As a result, messaging around your special feature won’t convert.

Disconnected user experience
Prospects don’t conform to the buyer journey you lay out. To effectively attract, convince, and convert prospects, you must construct a marketing channel that aligns with how they experience the journey.
Specifically, this means:

Your CTA must be calibrated to their stage of the buyer journey: We often see SaaS companies offer a CTA to schedule a demo, yet if the prospect is in the problem awareness stage, they aren’t ready for a demo. The CTA instead needs to offer a smaller ask, like a free calculator or template.
The messaging on the next channel must be congruent with the previous channel: We often see SaaS companies have messaging targeting a slightly different pain point from one touchpoint to the next. It may be very slight – as simple as incorrect timing of a correct pain point. However, even a slight disconnection in messaging can cause a prospect to exit the buyer journey.

In short, a collection of tactically flawless marketing campaigns is not an effective marketing strategy. 
The solution to building a profitable marketing strategy is taking a data-driven, holistic approach that meets prospects where they’re at and provides the knowledge they need to overcome objections and convert. 
This is the fundamental principle behind our Predictable Growth Methodology, which is the cornerstone of our marketing philosophy here at Powered by Search.
How To Build a Sustainable SaaS Marketing Strategy
The Predictable Growth Methodology is a systematic approach that creates a flywheel where each marketing initiative builds on the previous efforts, making the overall strategy progressively more efficient. 
Here’s how it works.
Step 1: Evaluate Your MRR Accelerators
Identify the seven types of “fit” beyond product-market fit that impact monthly recurring revenue growth. For example, Message-Market Fit, Customer-Channel Fit, and Customer-Content Fit are all “fits” that impact the efficacy of your marketing, and therefore, your revenue.
Audit your marketing strategy by combing through each of these “fits” and uncover the weakest points.
Note: As you’re auditing your marketing strategy, use real data – not assumptions.
You can also understand why website visitors aren’t converting by analyzing data from your customers’ perspective, rather than relying on internal assumptions.
Step 2: Understand Customer Intent and Pain Points
Assuming you know who your best customers are and their pain points is dangerous. 
Yes, you probably generally know who is buying your product, but do you know:

Every title involved in the buyer journey (Who brought it up first in the company? It isn’t just the check signer)
Which channel did they find you through? (You might see leads from LinkedIn ads, but it was actually a blog post the saw earlier that first made them interested in your company.)
Why they chose your product over the competition? (You might think it’s feature-related, but they might say it’s because your customer service is better.)

Answer these questions with data.
Specifically, we gather qualitative data from product, engineering, customer success, and analytics teams. 
We also gather data from the CRM and sales calls to better understand pain points and how they phrase them (this will impact your messaging). 
Step 3: Pinpoint Visitor Conversion Issues
Analyze why current website visitors aren’t converting into demos and trials. Look in your CRM to see which lead magnets perform the best and which ones have not been successful.
Look at Google Analytics to identify where users leave your website. These insights are essential for tying together the customer journey.
Step 4: Educate and Motivate Ideal Prospects
Publish content and messaging that addresses your prospects’ specific needs and pain points, and guides them towards a demo or trial.
If you’re only targeting bottom of the funnel visitors, you’ll see low conversion rates. Remember that enterprise purchases are considered purchases and don’t happen overnight. Therefore, you can’t expect to show up in a prospect’s feed at the last minute and win their business.
Step 5: Drive Right-Fit Traffic
Implement both paid and organic marketing campaigns to attract visitors who are most likely to convert into qualified prospects and eventually paying customers.
For this stage, you can use a tool like SparkToro to identify the channels your best customers use to research problems and discover solutions. Then, run campaigns on those channels. 
Step 6: Creating a Proof of Concept Pilot Project
Instead of questioning whether your strategy will scale, focus on proving that you can turn a click into a customer through a repeatable process. 
The Pilot Project is a simplified version of your demand generation program targeting your highest-value audience. 
It tests three critical fits: 

Customer-Channel Fit (testing paid channels like Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram, and optionally LinkedIn for high-LTV products)
Customer-Content Fit (converting visitors to leads through valuable content like guides or calculators with minimal form fields)
Journey-Offer Fit (using thank-you pages and follow-up campaigns to convert leads into demos/trials). 

This approach generates quick wins and momentum while establishing benchmark metrics and reducing the cost per acquisition over time.
Step 7: Measure and Generate Insights
Many marketers use vanity metrics to measure the efficacy of their marketing campaigns. We tie actions to ROI.
Specifically, look at:

MRR Velocity
CAC Reduction
LTV Growth 

Step 8: Create Your MRR Acceleration Roadmap
After you’ve had time to gather some data, prioritize initiatives using three criteria: 

Highest impact adjustments in the shortest timeframe, 
Simplest to deploy changes with minimal dependencies
Most proven ideas based on historical success. 

Once you’ve prioritized initiatives, assign them to relevant teams with detailed briefs explaining best and worst-case outcomes. 
Here’s exactly how we approach project management to ensure these initiatives are executed:

Assign each initiative to a Directly Responsible Individual.
Break down initiatives into actionable tasks that take less than a week to complete.
Ensure initiatives have a small project team (3-5 people) and everyone knows who does what and by when.

This process ensures that these “important, but not urgent” tasks are completed.

However, as we discussed, building an effective SaaS marketing strategy isn’t just about executing hacks and tactics to make a channel perform better. 
It’s really about creating a solid foundation and then building a flywheel where each marketing initiative becomes progressively more efficient.

                                Most of the time, the fastest impact we can have is to cut costs significantly. Most clients come to us with hugely inefficient spend, leaking budget.
There are relatively few exceptions. We find opportunities to cut spend rapidly so that we can invest the budget better.

                                Maybe you’ve been burned by agencies reporting on vanity metrics like impressions or CTR in the past. We don’t work like that.
We’re focused on driving improvement in bottom line metrics first and foremost. Trials, activations, closed deals. That’s what we care about.

We want you to pay us to drive predictable growth for your SaaS.

									FAQs
										You’ve probably got a lot of questions. The best way to get them answered is to book a SaaS Scale Session. But here’s the answers to some of the most common questions just in case.
		
				
							
											
							Can I pick which channels to focus on first?
						    
						    	Yes – We work with you to discover where your ideal customers spend their time and get into buying mode.
But we also have a systematic process for reviewing performance of different channels and we can usually tell which channels will work best in advance based on that and our in-depth experience of SaaS.

						    
					  	
											
							Are the agency fees and ad spend rolled into one number?
						    
						    	Many agencies will bill you for ad spend. But we think this creates perverse incentives.
Instead, with Powered by Search, you manage your billing for each ad account we work on. We just bill you our agency fee.

						    
					  	
											
							How do I know paid media will work for my SaaS?
						    
						    	We have experience of testing and scaling paid media campaigns for over 70 B2B SaaS companies ranging from $1M to $100M ARR.
The question is not: will paid media work for your SaaS (it will)
Instead, you should ask: What’s the correct way to build a paid media strategy for your SaaS.
We’re experts in this and can advise you on it before you spend a dime.

						    
					  	
											
							How much money should I set aside for ad budget?
						    
						    	Many agencies will tell you that you need x or y for ad budgets.
Others will say: ‘How long’s a piece of string?’ or ‘it depends’
The reality is, all of those answers are terrible. Instead, you should work out how much you need to grow by and work backwards from there.
We created a framework for doing this (and there’s even a calculator on the blog post so you can work it out). Find out how we work out ad budgets for our clients.

						    
					  	
											
							What kinds of companies are a good fit for us?
						    
						    	If you’re a B2B SaaS ready to commit a minimum $7500 a month on marketing for a minimum of 1 year, have strong product market fit and want to make building demand a priority, we can help you scale MRR at record-breaking speeds

						    
					  	
											
							What is PPC?
						    
						    	PPC stands for pay-per-click. It’s a blanket term for paid advertising through channels like Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Twitter Ads and Bing Ads.
It’s actually a misleading term because not every ad campaign you run will be paying for clicks – sometimes you’ll be paying for other things like reach or interactions.
But because it’s so widely used as a substitute for paid advertising, we use it too 🙂

All of the Practice Growth



None of the marketing headaches





Ways we can help you



How we showcase you







Running A Dental Practice Is Tough



We are here to make it easier.







Legacy Dental with us since 2015





You Want To Grow Your Practice



You didn’t get into dentistry just to fill seats—you want to build meaningful relationships with patients who value quality care and trust your team.









But You Have Your Hands Full



Between managing your team, delivering top-notch patient care, and figuring out online marketing, you’ve got your hands full, and there’s never enough time for everything.





True Smiles with us since 2023













Sky Creek Dental with us since 2016





You Need A Partner You Can Trust



At the end of a busy day, you shouldn’t have to worry about marketing. You need someone you can trust to handle it, so you can go home and enjoy what matters most to you.











Let Us Handle Your Marketing



So you can have more time to ”do you.”



I want more free time

















Meet Your Marketing Department



Or as many clients refer to as, best friends.





Many marketing firms offer similar services, but where we shine is in personalized connection. With us, you don’t just get a list of services; you gain a team genuinely invested in your practice’s success. It’s not just business—it’s a partnership that feels like friendship.



Meet the team (and their alter egos)















Real Stories, Real Results



Success stories from practices we’ve helped grow.












Hear It From Practices Like Yours














What You Get With Your Investment



Besides people that care about you.












Your Own Marketing Department: Forget piecemeal solutions or deciding between packages. With us, you gain an entire team dedicated to your practice’s success.



Results, Not Just Activities: We understand you’re after outcomes that truly matter to your practice, not just a checklist of services.



Plans Tailored to Your Unique Goals: Once onboard, you get access to all our expertise, custom-fitted to your current goals and needs.



Agile and Adaptive Strategy: As your practice grows and evolves, so does our approach—ensuring we meet your needs at every stage.














Pricing that Respects Your Bottom Line



We are a small business ourselves, we understand cash flow.





Aesthetic & Implant Dentistry of Lubbock
With Us Since 2017





Curious about cost? We get it– your cash flow and P&L health are not just numbers on a spreadsheet. Generally, we suggest setting aside 3-6% of your collections for marketing.
To give you an exact number, we’ll need to do an “exam” to understand your practice and goals. From there, we’ll create a customized “treatment plan” just for you.



Don’t worry, the initial “consult” is on us.







Book your appointment









Our Promise to You



A partnership built on trust. No strings attached.





No Contracts



With us, there’s no long-term contract or hidden gotchas. We’re month-to-month because we believe you should stay with us because you love our work (and hey, we love working with you too), not because you feel trapped in a contract. 





No Babysitting



You’ve got enough on your plate running a dental practice. The last thing you need is to babysit your marketing team. We’re proactive, self-driven, and accountable in everything we do. You won’t have to chase us down for updates or worry if we’re getting the job done. 





No Funny-Business



And when it comes to ownership, it’s simple: what we build for you, stays with you. If ever you decide to part ways (although most folks stick around for years), everything we’ve built for your practice is yours to keep. No funny business. That’s the Pain-Free promise.

















Transform Your Practice,



 One Small Bite at a Time.



Tune in as our founder, Eric, and a lineup of industry-leading guests dive into their strategies and explore the latest trends in the dental space.

Unique Goals. Unique Strategies.



Your Practice is Unique—So is Your Roadmap to Success.

         Verified Review
        
          When I was looking to bring on a marketing team to my practice I was referred to the “big guys” and found myself unimpressed and feeling like a number. I reached out to the team at pain free and they’ve given me an experience that I would normally give my patients. They go above and beyond and work with me to ensure we are on track for my practice goals. Highly personalized and they are highly invested in your goals as a practice and help to ensure your marketing matches that. They are awesome!

They are easy to get along with and genuinely want to understand and help you achieve your goals. They check in regularly to make sure things are going well and to adjust things as needed. I have had nothing but good experiences, and would highly recommend them.

What is Client Support?



At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, client support is not just about doing the necessary. We become an extension of your team to do what most dental marketing agencies won’t. We’re all about taking those marketing headaches off your plate—be it call feedback to the front desk, relocating your dental practice, trying to reactivate patients, or championing the product teams… We handle it all under one roof, freeing you to focus solely on dentistry!






It’s All About You!



During our initial consultations, it will all be about getting to know you! We’ll dive deep to understand your specific challenges, goals, and vision for your practice. Whether you’re an orthodontist looking to attract more teenage patients or a general dentist wanting to expand into cosmetic services, we’ll develop a customized plan that aligns with your objectives!



We also like to meet you, the client, where you are and see what needs to happen to take your business to the next level. During our initial relationship, we’ll uncover the best way to communicate with you, whether via text message, a quick call when you have a free minute, our monthly strategy meeting, or even quarterly if that is best. We do not believe in a “one size fits all” support model. Every client is different, and we market your office that way, too.




Our Strategy & Client Support Services




Dental Marketing Consulting & Support



Do you need to break free from the constraints of insurance companies and leap to fee-for-service or going out of network? Are you struggling with the challenge of hiring the right team members, or are you wondering how to build out a patient referral program? Rest assured, our client support team has been around the dental block. We’ve collaborated with professionals across all dental specialties, from orthodontists and periodontists to oral surgeons and pediatric dentists. This wealth of experience enables us to offer insights that are both deep and wide—because we’ve seen what works and, equally important, what doesn’t. Dental marketing consulting means pretty much helping you with whatever we can, with whatever you need, to ensure the practice is on a path to growth. 



And our support doesn’t stop at our door; we take pride in our extensive network of partners in the dental field. So, if there’s ever a question we can’t answer or a challenge we can’t solve, we can connect you with another industry expert to get you the guidance you need.



We believe in nurturing the relationship. That’s why we practice “Surprise and Delight.” It’s kind of like surprising your wife with flowers just to let her know you were thinking of her. We want you to know that as our client – our partner – we truly care about you and the success of your practice. Learn more about what Surprise and Delight means to us by checking out our blog.



Having a reliable support system is essential for any thriving dental practice. We’re here to help you prioritize your goals and set actionable steps to ensure you’re not just surviving but thriving in the dental industry.






Frequent & Open Communication



The Pain-Free team values frequent and open communication. Between standing meetings, we could send you an email with quick updates, a text message, or maybe even a quick call just to check in on you and how the office is doing! Also, the vice versa is true; if you need urgent attention or assistance from us, you do not need to wait for the next meeting; you can reach us during working hours, and we will make ourselves available! 



We also believe in transparent communication. No beating around the bush or buttering things up. We say it as it is to make sure you can make the best decisions. At the end of the day, we are a team. If you are winning, we are winning.












Performance & Metrics Reporting



We believe talk is cheap; the actual proof is in the pudding. That’s why we’re committed to total transparency regarding your marketing performance. We won’t just tell you things are going well—we’ll show you. Through comprehensive reporting and real-time analytics, you’ll have a clear view of marketing metrics and patient acquisition, allowing you to understand the impact of every marketing dollar spent. And if something’s not quite hitting the mark, we’re agile enough to pivot and adjust the strategy when it matters most. We’re in this to make your life easier and your practice more successful, and the numbers are there to prove it.





Call-Tracking & Feedback



At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, we understand that a successful dental practice extends beyond just skilled dentistry—it starts right at the front desk with every new patient call.



That’s why we’ve developed specialized call tracking and feedback services exclusively designed for dental practices. As part of dental marketing consulting, we don’t just help with your external and internal marketing; we help by providing you feedback on your team answering the phones! Our comprehensive solutions deliver insights into your team’s performance, offering valuable metrics that range from call durations to capturing the emotional tone of the conversations. This feedback is crucial for quality assurance, enabling you to fine-tune your staff’s approach to turn every phone interaction into an opportunity. In this way, we help you not just grow your practice from a business standpoint but also realize the broader vision you’ve always had for your practice.




Learn more about phone answering tips for dental practices here!




It’s important to know that our goal isn’t to point fingers or hover over your front desk staff; it’s to shine a light on areas for improvement and celebrate the strengths that boost team morale. After all, who doesn’t appreciate well-deserved recognition?












Assistance with Internal Marketing



When “dental marketing” comes up, many dentists immediately think of Google Ads, SEO, or social media campaigns. While these external efforts are undoubtedly important, there’s a whole other realm of opportunity within your practice’s walls that often goes overlooked—internal dental marketing. This is where the magic of patient retention and advocacy happens, setting the stage for sustainable growth.



Our client support team provides comprehensive assistance to help you capitalize on these internal marketing avenues. We understand that the most effective marketing strategies create a holistic patient experience—from the moment they find you online to the minute they walk out of your office with a brighter smile. You can learn more about our internal marketing efforts here!

  It’s not about being everywhere. It’s about being seen by the right people.
  
  
   
    
    
       Local SEO
    
    Local SEO helps your community find you, not just any dentist! By optimizing your presence across maps, listings, and local directories, we make you visible where it counts, to the people who are most likely to become your patients.

    On-page SEO is about telling your story clearly, page by page. We work on improving your content and website structure so that search engines understand it, and, more importantly, so patients feel understood when they read it.
    
  
  
   
    
    
       Off-page SEO
    
    Think of off-page SEO as building your digital reputation. Reviews, backlinks, and mentions across the web all help tell search engines that your practice is trusted, respected, and worth visiting.
    
  
  
   
    
    
       Technical SEO

  What You Can Expect For Your
  StoryEO Journey
  
  Find Your Practice’s Ideal Patients 
  
    
      



      Getting Started: We want to know what’s important to you: What services do you want to promote, and what types of patients are you looking for? Our team gets to know you and walks you through SEO (StoryEO) from a Pain-Free perspective.
      
    
      



      We work from a holistic approach: Your custom strategy is built around what we’ve learnt about you, from you. We do more than focus on traditional SEO pillars like local SEO and on-page optimizations; we uncover the core of your practice, and strategize how we can use this to align your messaging with your ideal patients.
      
    
      



      We continue the marathon:We also say, “SEO is a marathon, not a sprint” because effective SEO means consistently improving your story, checking performance, and keeping track of our results to start the cycle again.
      
    
      



      Helping your platforms work together: SEO goes beyond your website. That’s why regularly update and optimize all your online platforms and work with our larger team to ensure new patients are finding you, and finding a cohesive version of you.
      
    
      



      We believe in strong communication:Our team makes an effort to check in with you so you know what’s going on with your SEO. Whether it’s a video chat, Loom Video, or an email, we try to help you understand what we’re doing and how it’s supporting your goal.
      
    
      



      Our Pain-Free Promise: We practice transparency. If we aren’t happy with the numbers, we will let you know what we see and how we plan to address it. Why? Because we get excited when we know what we’re doing is working, and we’re passionate about positive results.

          Great company and people to work with at Pain-Free Dental Marketing. I have been working with them for a good 3-plus years. The team at Pain Free takes my feedback to heart and really trying hard to work on what I want for my dental office digital marketing plan. They are proactive in their actions and make things happen without me, as a doctor, telling them what to do. Overall, it has been a great experience working Pain-Free! They are full service, with a great team to do everything from photoshoots, video testimonials, website modification, SEO, phone call evaluations, and just a whole bunch of creative ideas to help my dental practice stand out. I am really glad that I connected with them after so many other dental marketing firms never come through with their promises and actions.

          It is not often that one encounters a company whose dedication and genuine care leave such a lasting impression, yet Pain-Free Dental has managed to do just that. In a time when we were struggling through unfulfilling relationships with two marketing firms—each failing to connect with our vision or amplify our voice—Pain-Free Dental stepped in like a breath of fresh air. Andre and Griffin did more than offer marketing solutions; they listened, they absorbed our story, and they crafted a path that aligned perfectly with who we are as a company. Their approach was consultative, compassionate, and refreshingly authentic. Griffin, in particular, has become so integral to our journey that we now consider them an extension of our team at PA Dental Implants & Periodontics—far more than an outside consultant, but a collaborator invested in our growth. What truly distinguishes Pain-Free Dental is their unwavering commitment to understanding the heart and soul of our brand. Their efforts have generated remarkable results, and I feel genuinely fortunate to have discovered this partnership. As we look to the future, it is with excitement and confidence that we anticipate many more years of shared success with Pain-Free Dental by our side.

The “Why” Behind the Shift



The Problem with Traditional SEO



For too long, Traditional SEO meant playing by the rules without knowing the rulebook. Generic keywords, technical tricks, and putting the essence of who you are second, all while trying to rank first.



Unfortunately, there is an inevitable trade-off between fostering a connection with people and an algorithm when doing this. Google recognized this issue years ago and changed the game, yet players continue relying on nothing but muscle memory and perceived “best practices”.



Your patients appreciate content that speaks directly to their needs—content that is transparent and authentic. Because patient interactions are valuable for any practice, it only makes sense for us to build a strategy that prioritizes genuine content.






The Rise of AI in Content Creation



With AI tools that can generate thousands of “SEO-ready” pages in moments, it’s not a surprise when we see generic content everywhere. As professionals, we can spot this content a mile away, but everyone else is catching on, too. Your patients are getting better at identifying when something is created by AI, whether it’s content or an image, and it feels disingenuous. What will set your practice apart isn’t only what you say, but how uniquely and authentically you say it.




The Advantages of SEO for Dentists






The Missing Link Between Rankings and New Patients



We’ve seen firsthand that high rankings don’t always translate to new patients walking through the door. That’s because, as a dental practice, your real online goal isn’t just visibility, but conversion. Getting people to pick up the phone because they connect with your practice happens when you share a story that resonates with them.





Our Philosophy as an Agency



At the heart of our shift to StoryEO is the understanding that your patient is the hero of their own story. They have a need, a problem they want to solve, and they want to feel heard. This means that positioning your practice as a trusted guide that offers them the solution they need is a must. 



We help you articulate your unique “why” and how it directly addresses their anxieties, desires, and challenges to compel them to connect.





















Rank Higher on Google Locally



Local SEO boots a dental practice’s rank in search results for people searching for dental services in a specific area. This is particularly useful for local practices needing a consistent flow of new patients.





Be More Visible than Your Competitors



It can be challenging to stand out to new patients when there are a lot of other dental practices in the area. SEO makes it easier for potential patients to find your dental services online.





Long-Term Lower Costs 



SEO is a long-term, cost-effective alternative to paid advertising. Unlike pay-per-click on Google, dental SEO directs potential patients to your website without charging for each click.







What is StoryEO?



Using Authentic Narratives to Represent Your Practice



StoryEO is a more intentional approach to Search Engine Optimization that puts your patient at the heart of your online presence. It’s all about creating content that reflects your practice’s unique values and communicates directly to the fears and desires of your prospective patients.





An SEO Approach That Wins Over Patients



Are you feeling a disconnect between your marketing efforts and the quality patients you want? Getting found online is only the first step. The real challenge is converting your digital footprint into lasting patient relationships that share your practice’s values. 



We’ve found that recommendations around traditional SEO approaches often focus on tactics that prioritize algorithms over actual human connection. Ever been to a dental website that sounds like this?



“Our dental clinic offers dental services in Colleyville for all dental needs in Colleyville, TX. Our dental experts provide dental care in Colleyville, Grapevine, and surrounding cities using the latest dental equipment in our dental office near you.”



If so, you know why we had to change. Human connection is the heart of what you do as a dentist, and overlooking it can leave you feeling hollow.



Your website should do more than simply rank; it should tell a compelling story that resonates with your ideal patient and inspires them to choose your practice. It’s this understanding and desire to help that has inspired our team to create “StoryEO”.







The StoryEO Process



Captivating Patients with Your Unique Story





Discovering Your Story



Effective dental marketing starts with understanding you. We want to know what’s important to you: what services do you want to promote, what types of patients are you looking for?



Our StoryEO experts will work with you to reveal your core values, what your patient experience encompasses, and what truly differentiates you. We aren’t about generalisms; we want to be as specific as possible.





















Translating Your Story into Engaging Content



This is where your practice’s voice comes alive online. We craft compelling copy for your homepage, service pages, and other key areas that speaks directly to your ideal patient, making them feel heard and understood. 



While strategic keyword integration is still a part of our process, our primary focus is on natural language that resonates with people, knowing that Google’s advanced algorithms can comprehend context and meaning. This way, we help you avoid generic phrases and, instead, highlight the specific, tangible ways you care for patients.









Here is what “traditional SEO” looks like vs StoryEO:



Before:



“Our dental clinic offers dental services in Colleyville for all dental needs in Colleyville, TX. Our dental experts provide dental care in Colleyville, Grapevine, and surrounding cities using the latest dental equipment in our dental office near you.”





After:



Finding a dentist you can truly trust, who genuinely listens and understands your concerns, can make all the difference. That’s why we’re dedicated to providing you with compassionate dental care tailored to your exact needs. Forget anxious dental visits, we use cutting-edge technology to make sure every experience, whether it’s a routine check-up or something more complex, is as comfortable and stress-free as possible.













Measuring Our Impact Through Patient Acquisition



SEO is an ongoing operation, and we stay focused on what truly matters: tracking new patient calls, appointments, and overall business growth. We continuously analyze how users interact with your content, refining your story to maximize its effectiveness in attracting and converting your ideal patients.





Ready to Tell Your Story?



Your story is your most powerful asset. Our StoryEO approach isn’t just about getting seen, it’s about getting chosen. Why keep potential patients in the waiting room of search engine obscurity? Let’s build a brand that attracts the right patients for your practice and makes you the first choice amongst your competitors.


 



  
    FAQ
    
    
    
  
  
    
      How is StoryEO different?
      
    
    Traditional SEO often focuses heavily on technical optimizations and specific keyword rankings on third-party tools. StoryEO prioritizes authentic, patient-centric content that builds trust and drives actual patient conversions.
  
  
    
      Will my rankings still matter with StoryEO?
      
    
    Yes, rankings are still important for visibility! However, with StoryEO, we focus on the quality and relevance of your content for real people first. Our ultimate goal is new patient acquisition, with rankings as a means to that end, not the sole measure of success.
  
  
    
      Is StoryEO only for certain types of dental practices?
      
    
    No, StoryEO is beneficial for all dental practices aiming to build their brand and attract new, quality patients. Whether you’re a specialist, a general dentist, or have a specific niche, the principles of authentic storytelling apply.
  
  
    
      How long does it take to see results with StoryEO?
      
    
    Building an authentic brand and attracting ideal patients is a long-term strategy that yields sustainable results. While initial improvements in engagement and visibility can happen relatively quickly, the full impact of StoryEO in terms of consistent new patient flow builds over time as your story resonates with your target audience. In this way, it’s similar to traditional SEO—it’s a marathon, not a sprint!

      How is StoryEO different?
      
    
    Traditional SEO often focuses heavily on technical optimizations and specific keyword rankings on third-party tools. StoryEO prioritizes authentic, patient-centric content that builds trust and drives actual patient conversions.
  ","
    
      Will my rankings still matter with StoryEO?
      
    
    Yes, rankings are still important for visibility! However, with StoryEO, we focus on the quality and relevance of your content for real people first. Our ultimate goal is new patient acquisition, with rankings as a means to that end, not the sole measure of success.
  ","
    
      Is StoryEO only for certain types of dental practices?
      
    
    No, StoryEO is beneficial for all dental practices aiming to build their brand and attract new, quality patients. Whether you’re a specialist, a general dentist, or have a specific niche, the principles of authentic storytelling apply.
  ","
    
      How long does it take to see results with StoryEO?
      
    
    Building an authentic brand and attracting ideal patients is a long-term strategy that yields sustainable results. While initial improvements in engagement and visibility can happen relatively quickly, the full impact of StoryEO in terms of consistent new patient flow builds over time as your story resonates with your target audience. In this way, it’s similar to traditional SEO—it’s a marathon, not a sprint!

    Our CultureStanding For What We Believe
    This is who we are and what matters to us.
    Connect with us
  
  






Our Core Values



We’re more than just a marketing agency for dentists. We’re a close-knit group with a shared mission: to simplify dental marketing, make it impactful, and add a personal touch.



Shake and Bake, Surprise and Delight, Compassionate Capitalism, and Move Upstream are at the center of who we are and what we do.  We believe that our culture is anchored yet adaptive to changing circumstances.  We maintain a living, breathing culture document that is ever-evolving and serves as our guide.  





1. Shake and Bake



Collaboration isn’t just a buzzword here- it’s our ethos. Whether brainstorming the next Invisalign campaign or cracking the code on SEO, it’s “always better when we’re together.”



Candor



Open communication is our middle name. We care enough about each other and our clients to give genuine, constructive feedback. We speak, we listen, and most importantly, we grow.



Enjoying Each Other



Work hard, play harder—that’s the motto we live by. Team building activities, company trips, and an abundance of high-fives make every day feel like a journey we’re excited to be on together.





2. Surprise and Delight



We’re not just in the business of marketing dental practices; we’re in the business of delivering the unexpected.  We proactively monitor our clients’ results and seek new approaches to improve them. We aim to be a partner to our clients’ practice, listening more than speaking and providing resources and solutions even outside the scope of marketing.  



Taking Initiative



Our approach is to be proactive to our clients’ goals and needs. Understanding industry trends, market conditions, and the uniqueness of each practice, we work to find the levers to bring sustained growth.   In the process, we deliver memorable results and experiences.



Celebrating Milestones



We are partners, not a vendor, and we want to celebrate your practice together.  Whether it’s achieving a practice growth goal, celebrating an anniversary or birthday, or acknowledging a small victory, we love to share in the success of our clients.





3. Compassionate Capitalism



Compassionate Capitalism means putting people before profits. Don’t get us wrong, we love profits, but that’s not our only focus. Compassionate Capitalism means recognizing that every interaction is an opportunity to improve someone’s life, be it our dedicated team members, our valued clients, or the communities we serve. Whether through our carefully curated benefits for employees or our ongoing charitable efforts, we aim to make a lasting impact beyond the dental chair.



Giving Back



Giving back to our community is ingrained in our DNA. We’re not just about filling dental chairs; we’re also about filling hearts through nonprofits that are near to our hearts. Our agency participates in various charity events throughout the year, including:




Dwell with Dignity



Operation Christmas Child



Local School Sponsorships










Employee Benefits



Taking care of our team isn’t just good business; it’s the right thing to do.  We believe in work-life balance and provide time and space for our team members to recharge and care for themselves and their families. Our benefits include: 




100% Paid Medical Insurance



Dental Stipend



401k with a 4% match



Unlimited Vacation



Generous travel allowance for vacations



“Happy Number” compensation package



Maternity/Paternity Leave



Annual Company Trip



Christmas in July & Anniversary Gifts



Frequent Team Building Events




People Above Profits



While we aim to be the best dental marketing agency in the Lone Star State and beyond, our compass is guided by compassion. Our people—clients and team members alike—always come first.





4. Move Upstream



At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, “Moving Upstream” encapsulates our approach to growth, innovation, and driving meaningful change. This philosophy urges all of us to continually expand our knowledge base while embracing challenges others might shy away from. You see, the difference you make in this agency often lies in the work you’re avoiding and the challenging conversations you’re not having. It’s about moving past the status quo and having the courage to do the “and”—those extra steps that elevate our service from good to exceptional. 



Continuous Improvement as Professionals



Good enough is never “enough” for us. We constantly seek to improve, adapt, and innovate for our clients and ourselves. Our dental marketing agency offers a variety of opportunities for our team members who want to continue their education as marketing professionals, take online courses, and more!





We Are An Innovative Marketing Agency for Dentists



As a forward-thinking agency, stagnation is our enemy. We continuously challenge ourselves to bring new, groundbreaking ideas to the table. Whether it’s the latest SEO strategies or an inventive social media campaign, we always look to stay ahead of the curve by staying current on the latest trends.



We Lead This Industry, We Don’t Follow.



At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, we don’t just follow the trends; we set them. We bring fresh, innovative ideas, drawing on years of expertise. We’re not here to do what everyone else does but to lead the way. It’s one of the many things that make our agency not just another workplace but a way to make a real difference in the marketing world.

  What You Can Expect With
   Internal Marketing
  
  Life is about balance.  And so is marketing. While new patient acquisition is our focus, we can’t forget to ensure your existing patient base is coming in to see you. 
  
    
      



      Transform Happy Patients into Brand Ambassadors: Your satisfied patients are your best advocates.  We’ll help you leverage testimonials and word-of-mouth to boost your credibility and attract new patients. 
      
    
      



      Enhanced Patient Retention: Keeping existing patients is just as crucial as acquiring new ones. Our targeted campaigns will not only engage your current patient base but also make them feel valued and appreciated.
      
    
      



      Elevate Your Email Marketing:  Email isn’t just for appointment reminders. We’ll help you to create engaging, customized email campaigns to keep your patients informed, educated, and excited about their dental health journey with you.
      
    
      



      Personalized Patient Journeys:  Every patient is unique, and their experience should be too. From the first appointment to ongoing care, we’ll help tailor your internal marketing strategies to provide exceptional, personalized experiences.

What is Internal Marketing for Dentists?



At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, we see your marketing strategy as a bird that needs both wings to fly. One wing is the external marketing you’re familiar with; the other is internal, and it’s focused on leveraging your existing patient base to elevate your practice. Internal marketing forces us to ask how to leverage getting existing patients back into the dental chair and make them cheerleaders for your office.



It’s important to know that “Internal marketing” is not just email campaigns or the other points mentioned above. It is also the way you answer the phone, the way you greet people at the door. It’s about your feel at the office and the experience that the patient has when they are with you, too. A big part of growing a dental practice is looking at the existing patient base and ensuring we do not forget about them. It’s about telling them about new services you offer, getting them back in for cosmetic treatment, and asking them for reviews! In essence, it’s every touchpoint your patients have with your practice—both in and out of the dental chair.






Email Marketing



Patient Reactivation: Reactivating dormant patients is one of the most cost-effective ways to boost your practice. Our expertly crafted emails can remind them of the quality care you provide, encouraging a return visit.



Use It, Don’t Lose It (UIDLI): Many people don’t realize that their dental benefits expire at the end of the year. We send compelling emails to remind patients to use their benefits before losing them, helping boost end-of-year appointments.











Unscheduled Treatment: For those patients who have initiated but not completed treatments, our targeted emails can nudge them toward completion. These reminders help patients take the necessary steps for their oral health and help you secure more completed treatments.



Seasonal Emails: From holiday promotions to summer cleaning specials, we can craft emails that tie into various seasons or events, giving patients an extra incentive to make an appointment.













Patient Referral Programs



Referral Incentives: Word-of-mouth is incredibly powerful in the healthcare industry. We can help you establish a robust referral program that rewards current patients for bringing new ones to your practice.



Tracking and Feedback: We provide systems to track the effectiveness of referral programs, offering insights that can be used to refine and optimize future efforts.







Sponsorship & Local Event Support



Flyers & Brochures: Local events are a great opportunity to showcase your practice. We can create eye-catching flyers and brochures that effectively communicate your services and special offers.



Sponsorship Support: We can assist in identifying and securing sponsorship opportunities that align with your practice’s ethos and target audience, amplifying your reach in the community.



SWAG Ideas & Designs: Everyone loves free stuff! We can help you come up with creative, branded items to give away at events, making sure your practice is memorable to potential new patients.















How Internal Marketing for Dentists Can Help You



Building Relationships, Not Just Client Lists



The power of internal marketing lies in its ability to foster relationships. How your front desk staff answers the phone, how you greet patients at the door, and the ambiance of your office—all these form part of the patient experience. And let’s face it, a happy patient not only comes back but also brings friends and family.



Don’t Forget Your Loyal Smiles



The existing patients you have are not just names in a database; they are the foundation of your practice. They deserve to know about new services you’re offering, whether that’s Invisalign, teeth whitening, or same-day crowns. And why stop there? Encourage them to return for cosmetic treatments, and don’t forget to ask them for reviews. After all, they already love your services; let them be your ambassadors.



Harness the Full Potential of Internal Marketing



Pain-Free Dental Marketing provides comprehensive strategies that will help you bring together both external and internal marketing efforts for a well-rounded, effective approach. Our support extends to helping you make critical decisions on where to focus your internal marketing for maximum returns. It’s not about throwing money at ads and billboards; it’s about finding the right balance between attracting new patients and retaining the ones you have. It’s about making your practice not just a choice, but the choice—for new and existing patients alike!

Meet Your Patients Where They Are



You can’t expect your potential patients to find you if they don’t even know you exist! That’s the magic of social media marketing for dentists—it gives your patients the chance to get to know you and build a relationship with your brand to help your dental chairs stay filled for years to come. We provide social media support to ensure you maintain a strong online presence that builds relationships with potential patients, not just sells!

Utilization of professional photos and videos that we capture of your practice



Comprehensive social media advertising





















Custom Facebook & Instagram Posts




Tailored content exclusively designed to resonate with your brand and audience.



Generic posts won’t cut it when you aim to be the go-to dental practice in town – we make your social media as personalized as the care you provide.



From smile transformations to oral hygiene tips, we create posts that not only entertain but educate, positioning you as a thought leader.








Monthly Organic Content Ideas




We provide monthly calendars of content themes and ideas to give you a strategic roadmap for your organic social media posts.



We handle the planning because we know how time-consuming a task can become, and let’s face it – you’ve got teeth to save.

Consistency is key in branding, and whether you’re celebrating your staff or sharing rave reviews, your posts should scream ‘YOU.’



We design templates that encapsulate your practice’s look and feel, making every post an extension of your brand while saving you design time.




















Why Your Practice Needs Social Media



Fact: Your potential patients are using social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as search engines to find goods and services. Another fact: If you’re not keeping your social media accounts up to date with fresh content or actively engaging in community groups, these potential patients may wonder whether you’re still open! 



Don’t let potential patients pass you by because you’re not online! Social media is no longer optional—it’s a necessity for growth and success. Having a presence on social media makes you discoverable to your local community, who may have otherwise not realized you were even around. With your online presence, you’re not just marketing; you are building relationships, educating patients, and ensuring your practice is thriving.








Brand Awareness
You have an excellent opportunity to build and increase brand awareness. By establishing a strong presence on social platforms, you can showcase your expertise, share informative content, and engage with potential patients. 



Patient Education 
You get a platform to educate patients about oral health, preventive care, dental procedures, and more. This establishes credibility, builds patient trust, and encourages regular visits.



Patient Engagement and Feedback 
You can interact with your patients directly and receive real-time feedback. Patients can ask questions, leave reviews, share their experiences, and provide valuable insights, which you can use to enhance the patient experience. This engagement helps foster strong patient relationships and promotes positive word-of-mouth referrals.







Increased Website Traffic 
You can drive traffic to your website, where patients can find more detailed information about services, contact details, and appointment booking options, increasing your chances of conversion.



Competitive Advantage
You can actively participate in social media to gain a competitive edge over your peers who may not be utilizing these platforms. It allows you to showcase your unique selling points, highlight your expertise, and differentiate yourself from other practices in your area.



Targeted Advertising
You can tap into advanced targeting options that let you reach your ideal patient demographic through PPC ads. This helps to maximize the return on investment (ROI) by focusing marketing efforts on those most likely to become patients.

    Frequently Asked Questions
    
    
    
  
  
    
      What kind of content engages patients?
      
    
    When it comes to social media content, the most engaging posts are ones that are unique to your practice and that come directly from your office! Think team lunches, birthdays, anniversaries, and community events. Keep in mind you want your content to be social and not interrupt users with “business” messages. We encourage our clients to appoint someone in their office to be “in charge” of social media. If this is not possible, we can always help you get your content out there- just send it our way!
  
  
    
      When is the best time to post on social media?
      
    
    Don’t sweat a social media posting “schedule.” A good rule of thumb is to post engaging content a couple of times per week. As for the time of day to post, think about when your desired audience would likely be most active. Usually, this is early in the morning, around the lunch hour, or later in the evening. There’s no rigid timeframe you have to adhere to as long as you avoid an overload of content or gaps where your social media gets forgotten for weeks or months!
  
  
    
      What social media platform is best for my practice?
      
    
    When deciding which social media platform to use, you need to consider your audience or ideal patient. For most General and Restorative Dentistry clients, Facebook is the go-to platform to reach families and older patients. The Instagram demographic skews younger, so it is great for Pediatric, Orthodontic, or Cosmetic Dentistry clients. Since Facebook owns Instagram, it is easy to cross-post content on both platforms! If you are into sharing super fun and engaging dental video content, TikTok may be right up your alley- this platform has the youngest audience of them all.

Reach More Patients Than Ever Before with Paid Dental Advertising



Your dental practice is the bee’s knees. Your staff is incredible. Your chairside manner is second to none. And your dental work? Absolutely impeccable! But here’s the drill – you’re not getting the patient numbers you deserve. If this sounds like you, it’s time to bring in the big guns: Paid Advertising.





At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, we specialize in paid advertising for dentists. We make sure your practice doesn’t just show up but stands out. From Google to Instagram, we bring you closer to your dream patients through a blend of insightful strategy and good old advertising magic. Forget the overwhelming whirlwind of PPC terms, click-through rates, and budget algorithms. We make the complex simple so you can go back to doing what you love: running an amazing dental practice.




Google Ads



We don’t need to tell you that Google is like the shopping mall of the internet. But did you know that Google Ads for dentists can literally put you on the map—like Google Maps—and ensure you’re the first name to pop up when someone types “best dentist near me”? When someone in your area is searching for a dentist, you want to be at the top of the results. We’ll help you create targeted campaigns that reach people actively looking for your services, whether you’re keen on more cosmetic dentistry cases or ramping up new patient numbers.






Bing Ads



While Google reigns supreme, Bing is within its own realm with a unique audience that offers untapped potential. Don’t miss out on potential patients who prefer Bing. Partnering with us means your Bing ads will complement your Google strategy (or stand-alone, depending on your demographic), reaching those who actively choose Bing as their go-to search engine. This ensures you get the most out of your advertising budget.












Facebook Ads



Facebook is more than just a social media platform; it’s a powerful tool for connecting with potential patients in your community. Patients use it as a search engine, so it makes sense to help them find what they’re looking for with paid ads. With its laser-focused targeting options, Facebook is an advertising boon for dentists looking to reach a defined audience. Whether it’s moms in a specific zip code or adults interested in teeth whitening, sit back and watch your ideal patients roll in. 





Instagram Ads



Instagram isn’t just for the foodies and influencers; it’s also a great space for dentists to connect with patients. It’s a visually driven platform that’s perfect for showcasing your practice and connecting with a younger, more engaged audience. We’ll help you create eye-catching Instagram Ads that highlight your unique brand and services to attract new patients and establish you as a modern, forward-thinking practice. 












YouTube Ads



If a picture is worth a thousand words, a video is worth a million. It’s one of the most engaging forms of content, and YouTube is the perfect way to showcase it. We’ll create high-quality YouTube Ads that showcase your expertise, build trust, and encourage viewers to choose your practice. From skippable video ads to non-skippable masterpieces, YouTube provides a platform for storytelling that can’t be ignored. Share patient testimonials, give a virtual tour of your office, or demonstrate your latest technology—the possibilities are endless. 







Traditional Media



Digital might be all the rage, but let’s not forget the classics—mailers, newspapers, magazines, radio, and TV. We don’t underestimate the power of traditional media. Whether it’s a well-placed ad in a local magazine or a catchy jingle on the radio, traditional media still has a significant role in a well-rounded advertising strategy.












Emerging Channels



New platforms are always emerging! From Pinterest to NextDoor and Yelp to Waze, these advertising platforms offer untapped potential for your dental practice. Plus, the users on these platforms are often more engaged, giving you a unique opportunity to capture their attention in less traditional yet highly effective ways. We’ll help you stay ahead of the curve by exploring the potential of emerging channels.

    Frequently Asked Questions
    
    
    Your Questions, Demystified
  
  
    
      How quickly can I see results from paid advertising?
      
    
    One of the joys of paid advertising is it can be quicker than other marketing methods. Unlike SEO, which takes time to build, paid ads can yield results sooner (with a healthy budget). But remember, rapid results don’t mean you should ignore long-term strategy.
  
  
    
      Can I set my own budget for campaigns?
      
    
    Absolutely. You can set your budget and adjust as needed. We’re here to make recommendations based on your practice’s needs and your financial comfort zone.
  
  
    
      Do you manage ad campaigns on all these platforms?
      
    
    Yes, we offer comprehensive ad management across all mentioned platforms, from Google to traditional media. You could say we’re platform-agnostic; we go where your potential patients are.
  
  
    
      Is there a long-term contract for your paid advertising services?
      
    
    No, we’re month-to-month. We want you to stay because you’re thrilled with the results, not because you’re caught in a contractual trap.

          Pain-Free helped us develop a fresh new logo. We had some specific ideas, but again, we couldn’t get it to production without Pain-Free’s help. It is now everywhere! The creative use of it, modified in so many ways, is super cool. And that’s not something that we do – Pain-Free does it for us! These guys are great. They really want you to achieve your practice vision and help you meet your long-term goals. If you’re ready to elevate, contact Pain-Free Dental Marketing.

Why Dental Branding Matters: Design, Photo & Video





How you present your practice is just as important as the level of care you provide. Dental branding is not just a superficial layer of your business; it’s the cornerstone of your public identity and the magnet that draws patients in.



Your brand communicates your values, professionalism, and commitment to excellence in care even before a patient walks through the door. It sets the tone for the patient experience, creating preconceptions that can be incredibly powerful in influencing choices.

You can learn more by checking out our blog post, “Dental Branding Mistakes to Avoid.”












Builds Trust and Credibility



Your brand is often the first interaction prospective patients have with your practice. A well-crafted brand exudes professionalism, setting the tone for the quality of care to expect. Conversely, inconsistent or outdated branding can be a turn-off, signaling potential patients to look elsewhere.





Sets You Apart from the Competition



The dental industry is saturated, and standing out can be a real challenge. Your branding serves as your unique fingerprint in a crowded marketplace, helping you differentiate your services from the myriad of options available. A unique dentist logo design, coupled with a cohesive branding strategy, ensures that when patients think of exceptional dental care, they think of you.





Facilitates Patient Retention and Loyalty



Consistent and appealing branding can instill a sense of loyalty, ensuring your patients don’t just come for a one-time appointment but stay for a lifetime of dental care. It’s about making your patients feel at home every time they see your dentist logo design or step into your office, increasing the likelihood they’ll return and even recommend your services to others.





Emotional Connection



Branding isn’t just about how you look; it’s about how you make people feel. Utilizing photos and videos that show patients what it’s like to visit your practice can spark feelings of comfort, safety, and trust – important emotions to evoke in an industry wrought with anxiety. When your dental branding consistently communicates these values, patients begin to see your practice as not just a service provider but as a trusted partner in their healthcare journey. 





Shows your expertise in dentistry



Compelling video content gives a sense of how competent the practice or dentist is: Your level of expertise, unique selling points, technology, and more. This builds trust with your future patients. 





Our Creative Services






As a dental marketing agency specializing in helping dental practices grow and succeed, Pain-Free Dental Marketing understands the importance of effective creative services in generating a strong brand identity.



In a world where first impressions often dictate choices, having a compelling and consistent brand can make all the difference. It’s not just about a sleek logo or a catchy slogan; it’s about crafting a comprehensive visual and verbal narrative that resonates with your target audience and is cohesive with the in-office experience.














Professional Dental Branding



Our creative team will work closely with you to understand your practice’s unique personality, values, and target audience. We’ll create a visually appealing and memorable brand identity that reflects the essence of your practice, incorporating elements such as dental logo design, color schemes, typography, and brand guidelines.



Generating Photo and Video Content



We work with our practices to capture authentic and organic content that showcases what makes you unique. We offer several options to generate these assets, from guiding your team, remote video sessions, or engaging a professional photographer, we are with you every step of the way.  



Eye-Catching Marketing Collateral



We understand that, at some stage, your dental practice will need various marketing materials to effectively promote your services. Our graphic design services cover the creation of a wide range of collateral, including brochures, flyers, business cards, appointment cards, and signage. If you can dream it, we can do it!



Patient Education Materials



Educating patients about oral health and various dental procedures is crucial for building trust and encouraging treatment acceptance. Pain-Free Dental Marketing can assist you in creating informative and visually appealing patient education materials, including infographics, posters, and pamphlets. 






Stand Out From The Crowd



Creating a brand that stands out and attracts the right patients doesn’t have to be like pulling teeth. Let Pain-Free Dental Marketing take the reins and bring your vision to life. You focus on creating beautiful smiles; we’ll handle making your practice look dazzling.

         Verified Review
        
          Eric and his team at Pain-Free Dental Marketing are a pleasure to work with and have gotten us some great results. We worked with them on re-branding after we purchased our dental practice and have continued to trust them with our Facebook ad campaigns, Google presence, marketing materials, and other print materials. They also helped us design and maintain a modern, sleek website that works well for getting our distinctive out to our community.  They are responsive to our needs and requests and understand us as a business, so they represent us well in our advertising. And they are fun! I would recommend them to any dental office who wants a full-service marketing firm that will really take an interest in your business.

Your First Impression Matters



First impressions are often the ones that last, and for many of your potential patients, that first touchpoint is through your website. 



Is your website reflecting the quality, professionalism, and care you provide? Does it do a good job at showing potential patients how you’re different from the rest? We use website design and development to help make it clear why you’re the best choice for their dental needs. 






Keeping The Costs Transparent



When it comes to pricing, we know that one size doesn’t fit all. That’s why we don’t believe in a flat fee or a one-off package that might include services you don’t need. Our pricing is tailored to your practice, needs, and growth ambitions.



That’s what we mean when we say, “Your Success, Your Way.”

    Industry FriendsWe Love to Meet Others That Do Great Things
    If you’re passionate about helping dental practices thrive, we’d love to connect.
    Let’s be friends
  
  





Together We’re Better



We’re all about making friends with other dental industry experts.




At Pain-Free Dental Marketing, the best partnerships are built on shared values, trust, and a commitment to excellence. In our experience, dental practices thrive when they connect with the community around them and learn from one another.



That’s why we regularly introduce our clients to a handful of partners in our tribe so our clients can choose the best fit for them. We love our industry friends and think they’re all pretty awesome. We don’t charge or accept a referral fee for these introductions. We do so because we believe our friends can help our dental practices be more successful.  



So, if you’re a company passionate about helping dental practices thrive, we want to hear from you! Let’s team up and help our practices grow!

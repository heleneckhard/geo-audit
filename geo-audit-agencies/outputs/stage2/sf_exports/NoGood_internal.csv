Conversion Rate Optimization and UX/UI: NoGood took on the redesign of the complete US site. From the homepage all the way through product pages, the About Us page, pricing, and more. Pages were created to optimize conversion rate and deliver a next-level user experience.
Information Architecture and Content Mapping: The first thing we noticed about the current website was the structure needed an update. In order to develop an effective customer journey, we built out a navigation structure developed to deliver the optimal experience from a content and SEO standpoint.
Conversion Rate Optimization: We significantly decreased time spent per SQL through automated lead filtration, personalized email workflows, and meeting scheduling automation.

                                            What is answer engine optimization?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Answer engine optimization (AEO) refers to the practice of optimizing content to influence the learning and training of answer engines and ensure your brand and your content are intentionally present in the right spaces at the right times. Answer engines include generative AI LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, or Perplexity, Google’s AI Overviews, or even voice search products like Alexa or Siri.
 
AEO can be considered a subdivision or an evolution of search engine optimization (SEO). It follows similar principles of organic marketing with an emphasis on understanding a user’s search intent. AEO and SEO share a common goal of providing highly useful content for users.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            How can NoGood’s answer engine optimization services benefit my business?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Much like SEO, AEO doesn’t need to be a big initial investment. But, if done right, it can greatly benefit your marketing efforts. AEO enhances online visibility in AI search platforms and can help position your brand as a helpful solution and authoritative source. This visibility, in turn, can drive organic traffic, increased engagement, positive user experience, and ultimately more conversions.
 
In this age of AI search, where users are prioritizing convenience and speed, their queries on answer engines are often high-intent – they’re nearly ready to buy. Being part of the AI-generated response on these platforms can significantly affect your bottom line.

                                            How can AEO work alongside my SEO and digital marketing strategies?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        AEO can and should be implemented alongside more traditional SEO as well as any other digital marketing strategies. AEO can complement and enhance these additional tactics. With the emphasis on crafting and refining high-quality content, AEO initiatives can help you generate content that will perform well in traditional search engines and overall build an impressive digital presence.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What tools do you recommend for effective AEO implementation?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        We believe that an AI visibility monitoring tool is critical to understand your position and performance on AI search platforms. At NoGood, we use Goodie, an external, third-party tool that offers an all-in-one platform for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO). Based on contracting agreements, we can utilize Goodie’s real-time monitoring, AEO- and SEO-optimized content creation, and traffic and conversion tracking features to glean actionable insights for our clients on their visibility across LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            How long does it take to see results from AEO?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        How long it takes to see results from AEO can depend on a wide variety of factors. The most important thing to consider is the current state of your digital presence. Where you’re starting from can significantly impact your timeline for seeing results. Generally, however, AEO follows a similar timeline to SEO – you may start seeing results within a few months of implementation.

                                        The fees for an NYC digital marketing company vary widely based on several factors. Pricing depends on the scope and complexity of digital services, the digital agency’s expertise and reputation, and the specific needs of the client. Factors such as the scale of campaigns, the level of customization, and the duration of engagement also influence costs. Additionally, comprehensive services and specialized online marketing strategies tend to command higher fees compared to basic or standard offerings. Always consider the agency’s extensive experience, case studies, and client reviews when evaluating their pricing structure.

How do I find a good social media agency?

A strong social media agency will demonstrate industry experience, platform expertise, and a proven track record (ideally through case studies and past campaigns). Look for teams that use AI-driven insights to guide strategy, streamline workflows, and personalize content. Prioritize agencies that communicate clearly, collaborate well, and stay ahead of trends. Finally, ensure their service offerings align with your goals and budget.







Why hire a top social media agency?

Managing social media effectively is complex, and a top agency can elevate both organic and paid performance while saving you time. The best agencies blend creative strategy with AI-powered tools to optimize targeting, content, and engagement. This helps you stay connected to your audience, understand cultural conversations, and turn insights into meaningful growth.







How do social media agencies measure success of their campaigns?

Agencies track results using KPIs like engagement, reach, follower growth, traffic, and conversions. Leading teams also leverage AI analytics to detect patterns, attribute performance more accurately, and forecast future results. After aligning measurement with your business goals, they report using platform dashboards, third-party tools, and increasingly, AI-driven performance summaries.







How do social media agencies stay up-to-date on algorithm changes?

Top agencies monitor official platform updates, industry experts, and emerging tech trends; including advances in AI that often influence algorithm behavior. They use real-time alerts, analytics tools, and continuous learning to adapt strategies quickly. This proactive approach ensures clients stay competitive even as platforms evolve.

The New Era of Healthcare Marketing



Healthcare marketing has entered a transformative phase where artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and evolving regulatory frameworks are reshaping how patients discover, evaluate, and engage with care. Today’s healthcare brands face unprecedented challenges:




Navigating HIPAA compliance alongside Consent Mode



Leveraging first-party data while respecting patient privacy



Meeting consumer expectations for personalized, value-based care experiences




The agencies that excel in 2026 aren’t just creative powerhouses or performance marketing experts. They’re integrated partners who understand the intersection of compliance, technology, and human empathy.



This curated list represents the top 26 healthcare marketing agencies (not including NoGood, the top agency for AI-forward healthcare brands) evaluated by growth experts who’ve assessed over 100 firms across four critical dimensions: regulatory expertise, growth intelligence, creative storytelling, and measurable outcomes.



Whether you’re a pharmaceutical company launching a rare disease therapy, a health system expanding patient acquisition, or a med-tech innovator entering new markets, choosing the right agency partner can accelerate growth by 3-5 years. Let’s explore what defines excellence in healthcare marketing today.



What Makes a Great Healthcare Marketing Agency in 2026



Before diving into our agency rankings, understanding the evaluation criteria helps you make informed decisions for your healthcare brand.



1. Regulatory Expertise & Compliance Mastery



Top healthcare marketing agencies demonstrate deep fluency in:




HIPAA compliance for patient data protection and marketing communications



FDA advertising guidelines for pharmaceutical and medical device promotion



LegitScript certification for health-related digital advertising



Consent Mode implementation for privacy-first tracking



State-specific regulations across telehealth, cannabis therapeutics, and reproductive health




The best agencies don’t treat compliance as a barrier. They architect campaigns that achieve breakthrough creative while exceeding regulatory standards.



2. Growth Intelligence & Predictive Analytics



Modern healthcare marketing demands sophisticated data capabilities:




Predictive forecasting models that project patient acquisition costs 6-12 months ahead



Attribution modeling across complex patient journeys (often 15+ touchpoints)



Cohort analysis to understand lifetime value by patient segment



Competitive intelligence tracking share of voice and digital presence



Real-time dashboards integrating CRM, claims data, and marketing performance




Agencies that excel here transform marketing from cost center to revenue driver with clear ROI visibility.



3. Integrated Storytelling Across Stakeholders



Healthcare marketing uniquely requires reaching multiple decision-makers:




Patients seeking empathetic, accessible health information



Healthcare providers (HCPs) demanding scientific rigor and clinical evidence



Payers focused on cost-effectiveness and outcomes data



Caregivers navigating complex care decisions for loved ones




Elite agencies craft cohesive narratives that resonate across these diverse audiences while maintaining brand consistency.



4. Full-Funnel Visibility & Optimization



The patient journey extends far beyond conversion:




Awareness: Content marketing, SEO, AEO, paid media, influencer partnerships



Consideration: Educational resources, webinars, patient testimonials



Conversion: Optimized scheduling flows, telehealth integration, form design



Adherence: CRM automation, patient support programs, behavioral nudges



Advocacy: Referral programs, community building, user-generated content




Top agencies measure and optimize across the entire lifecycle, not just top-of-funnel metrics.

How to Choose the Right Healthcare Marketing Partner



Selecting the ideal healthcare marketing agency requires evaluating alignment across multiple dimensions:




Define Your Goals & Success Metrics: Clarify what you want to achieve and establish baseline metrics that define what success looks like quarterly.



Evaluate Compliance Maturity & Regulatory Expertise: Prompt the agency about their expertise surrounding HIPAA, FDA, Consent Mode, and state regulations. Request case studies if needed.



Assess Analytics Capabilities & Transparency: Ask about attribution modeling, predictive forecasting, dashboards, and integration capabilities.



Demand Measurable ROI & Predictive Forecasting: Request case studies showing documented ROI, evaluate their approach to testing, learning, and optimization, and ensure they provide regular business reviews with strategic recommendations.



Verify Industry Experience & Cultural Fit: Schedule discovery calls and ask: Have they worked with organizations similar to yours? What do past clients say about working with them? Who will actually work on your account? Do they share your commitment to patient-centric care?

Healthcare Marketing Agencies: FAQs






What makes healthcare marketing different from other industries?

Healthcare marketing must balance empathy and trust-building with performance metrics, often addressing multiple stakeholders (patients, providers, payers, caregivers) with divergent needs. Namely: 




Healthcare marketing operates under strict regulatory frameworks including HIPAA privacy laws, FDA advertising guidelines, and industry-specific compliance requirements.



The patient journey is typically longer and more complex, requiring sophisticated attribution modeling to understand which touchpoints drive conversions.








How much should I budget for healthcare marketing?

Healthcare organizations typically allocate 6-12% of gross revenue to marketing, though this varies significantly by specialty, market competition, and growth stage. Digital patient acquisition costs range from $150-$800 per new patient depending on specialty (primary care on lower end, specialty surgery on higher end).







What credentials should healthcare marketing agencies have?

Look for agencies with HIPAA compliance certifications, LegitScript accreditation for healthcare advertising, and demonstrated experience with FDA guidelines if working with pharmaceuticals or devices.



Team members should include healthcare marketing specialists, not just general marketers applying templates to healthcare.







How long does it take to see results from healthcare marketing?

The best agencies provide phased timelines with milestone-based success metrics. Here are some benchmarks to get you started:




SEO and content marketing typically require 6-12 months to generate significant organic traffic growth.



Paid media campaigns can drive immediate visibility but need 3-4 months to optimize conversion rates and reduce cost per acquisition.



Brand awareness campaigns should run 6-12 months minimum.



Patient retention and referral programs show incremental improvements over 12-24 months.








Should I hire a specialist healthcare agency or general marketing firm?

Healthcare marketing agencies offer deep regulatory expertise, industry benchmarks, and healthcare-focused creative talent. They understand patient psychology, provider decision-making, and compliance requirements that general agencies often miss.



While healthcare specialists may cost 15-30% more, they typically deliver faster results and avoid costly compliance mistakes. Choose specialized agencies unless your healthcare organization has substantial in-house healthcare marketing expertise.



How do healthcare marketing agencies ensure HIPAA compliance?



Reputable healthcare marketing agencies implement comprehensive HIPAA compliance programs including Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), employee training, secure data handling protocols, and regular audits. They:




Use HIPAA-compliant marketing automation platforms



Implement proper website tracking consent mechanisms



Avoid using protected health information (PHI) in retargeting campaigns




Always request documentation of their compliance program and verify BAAs are executed before sharing any patient data.







What’s the difference between B2B and B2C healthcare marketing?


B2B healthcare marketing (targeting providers, health systems, and payers) emphasizes clinical efficacy, ROI, and integration capabilities through white papers, medical conferences, and peer-to-peer sales.



B2C healthcare marketing (targeting patients) focuses on empathy, accessibility, and educational content through search marketing, social media, and patient testimonials.




Many healthcare brands require both approaches. For example, pharmaceutical companies market to both prescribing physicians and patients.

                    Great list! It’s refreshing to see such a comprehensive breakdown of top healthcare marketing agencies. NoGood’s growth-focused approach and impressive client portfolio definitely stand out, but I’m also intrigued by Snow Companies’ emphasis on patient storytelling—such a powerful way to humanize healthcare marketing. For anyone in the industry, this is a fantastic resource to find the right partner. Would love to see a follow-up on how these agencies are adapting to emerging trends like AI and telehealth marketing. Thanks for sharing!

                    Great list! It’s refreshing to see such a comprehensive breakdown of top healthcare marketing agencies. NoGood’s growth-focused approach and impressive client portfolio definitely stand out, but I’m also intrigued by Snow Companies’ emphasis on patient storytelling—such a powerful way to humanize healthcare marketing. For anyone in the industry, this is a fantastic resource to find the right partner. Would love to see a follow-up on how these agencies are adapting to emerging trends like AI and telehealth marketing. Thanks for sharing!

V. Additional Disclosures for Individuals Residing in Certain US States



Your State Privacy Rights
Depending on your state of residence, consumer privacy laws may provide their residents with additional rights regarding our use of their personal information and require specific disclosures (“State Privacy Laws”). In particular, because the Nebraska Data Privacy Act (NDPA) and Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (TDPSA) apply regardless of business size or data volume thresholds, NoGood complies with these laws to the extent we process personal information of Nebraska or Texas residents. NoGood does not at this time meet the thresholds that would require compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), or other applicable U.S. state privacy laws.

Access, Correction, and Deletion
Depending on your state of residence, you may have the right to (1) request to know more about and access your personal information, including in a portable format, (2) request deletion of your personal information, and (3) request correction of inaccurate personal information. To request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information, please email us at privacy@nogood.io*protected email*. Once we receive the request, we will verify your request by asking you to provide information related to your recent interactions with us.

Nondiscrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.

Appeals
If we deny your request, you may appeal our decision by contacting us at privacy@nogood.io*protected email*. If you have concerns about the results of an appeal, you may contact the attorney general in the state where you reside.

Authorized Agents
If you are an authorized agent seeking to make an opt-out request for a consumer, please contact us at privacy@nogood.io*protected email*.

Data Security
We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We use layered security approaches that include encryption, access control, two-factor authentication, and other restricted permissions to secure your personal information. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.



VI. Additional Disclosures for Individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom



For visitors from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom, we comply with applicable data protection laws, including the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our legal basis for processing personal data depends on the context in which it is collected. In most cases, we process personal data only when we have your consent, when it is necessary to provide our services, or when we have a legitimate business interest that is not overridden by your data-protection rights.

You have the following rights with respect to your personal data:




Access and Portability – Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.



Correction – Request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.



Deletion (“Right to Be Forgotten”) – Request that we delete your personal data, subject to applicable legal obligations.



Restriction and Objection – Request limits on or object to the processing of your personal data.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at privacy@nogood.io*protected email*. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request. If you are based in the EEA or the UK and have concerns about how we handle your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

                                            What differentiates video marketing from traditional marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        A video campaign relies on creating compelling videos that engage your target audience to help you promote your products and services. Video content helps brands tell their stories better than any other content medium. From product videos to company culture videos, a video marketing company can showcase all your brand has to offer in a way that engages and converts your target audience. At NoGood, we are experts in every stage of video production, from script writing to on-location shoots. Our team can even film viral social media content.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What are the benefits of working with a video marketing agency like NoGood?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Unlike traditional television advertising, which requires high production costs and time slots, all businesses today can create high-quality video content across all distribution channels. Video marketing is an essential part of any digital marketing strategy. Video content generates leads, improves brand recognition, and drives conversions for your business.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is video marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        The biggest challenge when implementing a video marketing strategy is the resources needed to create high-quality content.

                                            What industries benefit most from lifecycle marketing strategies?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Lifecycle marketing strategies can benefit most industries, but some tend to see more significant benefits from this approach:
Ecommerce: As marketers, we know Ecommerce is all about driving sales and sustaining customer loyalty. With a lifecycle marketing strategy, you can drive growth by creating flows to encourage repeat purchases, offer personalized product recommendations, and obtain customer feedback. You can also add a loyalty program to your mix to reward buyers for repeat purchases.
SaaS: A longer, more complex buyer journey means recruiting qualified leads is even more pertinent. Incorporating strategies like targeted email flows and personalized SMS and push notifications provides an opportunity for upsells and cross-sells while driving long-term retention for your product.
B2B: As a B2B company, lifecycle marketing can help you maintain customer relationships by opening a two-way conversation to share product developments and for your clients to share feedback.
Fintech: Financial services can be complex. Lifecycle marketing helps you communicate your service and product offerings so your potential customers understand exactly why your company is right for them. With personalized email campaigns and targeted SMS and push notifications, you can target your customers’ unique challenges and offer strategic solutions to help them achieve their financial goals.
Healthcare: For healthcare companies, we know your top priority is patient satisfaction and sustained loyalty. Lifecycle marketing can help you nurture those relationships with automated flows that are segmented to provide personalized health recommendations, check-ups, usage reminders, and obtain patient feedback.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why Is lifecycle marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Lifecycle marketing is highly effective in recruiting qualified leads and nurturing customer relationships, but this strategy can come with a unique set of challenges. In order to create targeted, hyper-personalized campaigns and flows, you need specific customer data, which can pose a challenge for many businesses to collect. Partnering with a lifecycle marketing agency like NoGood, gives you access to growth experts who can collect and analyze customer data and develop dynamic strategies to nurture customer relationships and drive conversions.

                                            When should I hire a fractional CMO?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        You should consider hiring a part-time CMO when your business needs high-level marketing expertise but isn’t ready for a full-time CMO commitment. This option is ideal for companies looking to scale quickly, launch new products, or refine their digital marketing strategy. A fractional CMO provides a fresh perspective, strategic direction, and leadership at a fraction of the cost of a full-time executive, making it perfect for startups, growing businesses, or those undergoing significant changes.

                                Quantity and quality are the name of the game. There is no room for compromise.
There are 34 million videos posted on TikTok and at least 95 million photos and videos on Instagram daily. Content publication continues to increase by 300% per month. The true challenge for brands is to keep up in an oversaturated space and break through the clutter at the same time. Our team of creators and marketers draw from industry insights to create a large content library of social media posts without compromising on content quality, allowing our partners to battle the content fatigue users deal with every day.

                                            How can content marketing generate leads?

The rise of generative AI isn’t just another passing wave, it’s a change in the current that’s redefining both how consumers discover and digest information and how businesses connect with audiences. LLMs are rapidly becoming the gate keepers of information on the web with ChatGPT rapidly becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. 



In traditional organic search and SEO, most strategies revolve around climbing rankings on search engine results pages (SERPs). But with Generative Engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini are driving more and more search behavior, users are asking questions in a conversational way and receiving synthesized, context-rich answers that often eliminate the need to click on external links.



The concept of Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) emerges as the strategic framework to ensure your brand is both discoverable and cited by these new highly intelligent engines. This is an area that we have research and written about extensively. To succeed in this new landscape, brands need a playbook that weaves together the sustainable SEO fundamentals as well as AI Search insights. 



This guide will walk you through why GEO matters, how it differs from standard SEO, what ranking factors drive AI-based visibility, and how to implement effective GEO strategies and measure impact. 



Why GEO Matters More Than Ever



Generative AI has turned the concept of “search” on its head. Users no longer need to browse through lists of blue links; advanced LLMs can synthesize meaningful answers in real time, often without sending the user to an additional website. This answers-first paradigm carries big implications for brands and marketers:




Visibility is more elusive: Simply ranking #1 on Google doesn’t guarantee you’ll be featured in an AI-generated response.



Users expect concise, context-rich replies: They might never see your well-optimized landing page if the AI chat interface provides everything they need.



Multi-turn conversations: Users can refine queries on the fly and ask follow-up questions, shifting from “What are the best running shoes?” to “Which brand is eco-friendly?” and “Where can I buy them locally right now?”—all in a single session.

In this environment, your brand must be recognized by AI engines as authoritative, trustworthy, and contextually relevant. Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) ensures that you not only exist in a search index, but also become a central piece of the conversation—that is, the conversation between the user and the AI model.



The Consequences of Not Adapting



Brands that ignore GEO risk fading out of AI-driven ecosystems, losing mindshare and, ultimately, conversions. Traditional SEO alone is no longer sufficient; even if your page ranks well on Google, AI results may overshadow standard SERPs or reduce click-through rates. Thus, investing in GEO now is an investment in future-proofing your brand’s discoverability.



What Is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?



Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of influencing and optimizing how AI-driven search systems—especially those powered by LLMs—access, interpret, and include your content in their automatically generated answers. 



While SEO focuses on ranking in traditional SERPs, GEO goes a step further. With GEO, your objective is to:




Embed your brand, data, and expertise into the knowledge base and training sets of AI models.



Align your content structure and signals so that real-time AI search engines (e.g., Perplexity, Bing Chat, ChatGPT Search) see you as a relevant, high-authority source.



Encourage AI to cite or reference your brand and offerings in the final, synthesized response it delivers to the user.




It’s a holistic approach that blends technical SEO with content quality, brand authority, and community engagement, all under the lens of how advanced AI systems process and produce information.

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) vs. Answer Engine Optimization (AEO): What’s the Difference?



GEO and AEO are both strategies aimed at boosting the visibility of your content online in AI-driven search functions, but AEO encompasses additional platforms beyond those targeted by GEO practices, and GEO is geared toward ensuring your content is one of many sources used in the synthesis process that enables AI platforms to provide succinct and summarized answers.



Both AEO and GEO methodologies strive to provide concise, direct answers to user queries to increase the chance of appearing in AI-generated results. With GEO, as we’ve discussed, this refers to AI-driven search systems, and particularly LLMs. With AEO, this can also mean AI Overviews or other AI-powered aspects that are beginning to populate more traditional search engines.



At the foundation of both AEO and GEO is understanding user intent, incorporating relevant keywords, structuring content effectively to align with algorithms and AI crawlers, and using clear language throughout your content. The same techniques are used for both AEO and GEO since all generative engines are a type of answer engine.



Market Growth and User Adoption of Generative Search and LLMs



To understand the urgency behind GEO, consider the rapid adoption of LLMs and AI-based search technologies:




ChatGPT reached 100 million monthly users within two months of launch, making it one of the fastest-growing consumer applications in history. In November of 2024, it had 3.8 billion visits, showing that initial hype is transitioning into mainstream usage.



According to a recent survey from investment banking firm Evercore, 8% of Americans use ChatGPT as their go-to search engine.



A McKinsey survey in mid-2024 found that 65% of organizations now regularly use generative AI, up from just 33% the previous year. This aligns with the broad enterprise pivot toward AI-driven insights.



Gartner projects that by 2026, 25% of all queries could shift from traditional search engines to AI-driven interfaces, reducing organic search traffic for many companies by up to 50%.




These trends highlight the explosive growth of AI search channels. If your brand is absent from these channels—or if your mentions are inaccurate—you could be missing out on millions of high-intent users.



What’s the Difference Between GEO and SEO?



At a glance, GEO seems like a natural extension of SEO. Both revolve around making content visible and authoritative, but the mechanics of each differ significantly.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1182"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2.png"" alt=""Chart detailing the differences between GEO and SEO"" class=""wp-image-44905"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2-700x766.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2-540x591.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2-160x175.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image3-2-320x350.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">



One of the biggest contrasts is that SEO is built around competition for finite SERP positions (rank #1, #2, #3, etc.), whereas GEO is more about influencing what an AI engine “thinks” and “says” when it fields questions. 



Because AI’s answers are generated dynamically—and often vary from user to user—traditional ranking trackers don’t apply. Instead, you might look at brand presence across AI responses, the quality of mentions, and how these mentions convert into brand searches or direct visits later.



GEO Optimization and Ranking Factors



AI systems weigh a combination of technical, content, brand, and engagement signals when generating answers. While each generative model has its own training and referencing logic, several overarching factors frequently determine whether (and how) your brand appears.



Content Quality & Context



Generative models thrive on detailed, high-quality content. If your pages offer superficial or repetitive information, an LLM may ignore them. Focus on:




Topical Depth: Provide unique data, expert opinions, or original research.



Contextual Relevance: Align content around real user questions and pain points, anticipating the queries people pose to AI.



Readability & Structure: Format text with headings, bullet points, and concise paragraphs to make it easy for AI to parse.




Technical Accessibility & Structured Data



As with SEO, you must ensure your site is crawlable and indexed. You should:




Include Schema Markup (JSON-LD): e.g., FAQ, Article, Product, and Author schema help AI understand your site.



Ensure Open Access: Allow GPTBot and other AI crawlers if you want your data included in their training sets or live indexing.



Optimize Site Speed & Mobile-Friendliness: Real-time AI crawlers assess site performance and may discard or deprioritize slow, clunky pages.




Entity and Brand Authority



LLMs generally rely on an entity-based understanding of content:




Entity Confirmation: Ensure your brand is defined consistently across platforms, from social media to Wikipedia.



Authority Cues: Publications, academic references, news mentions, and strong domain-level authority all indicate trustworthiness.



E-E-A-T Alignment: Google’s emphasis on Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) also extends to how LLMs interpret your site.




Off-Page Signals & Community Mentions



Generative AI training can involve everything from social media posts to discussions on forums. Mentions in these spaces can shape how the model perceives your brand:




Unlinked Brand Mentions: LLMs can learn about your product even from references without a hyperlink.



Community Discussions: When your brand is actively recommended or debated in communities like Reddit or Quora, that can surface in AI’s knowledge base.



Social Proof: High engagement on social posts and user-generated content signals real-world relevance.




Engagement & User Experience



While Google may or may not take bounce rates into account for rankings, AI systems are beginning to incorporate user feedback loops:




Conversational Flow: If users repeatedly mention or engage with your brand in multi-turn queries, the AI may rank you higher or keep referencing you.



Positive Sentiment: LLMs can parse sentiment in reviews or discussions to gauge brand favorability and will rank brands with positive sentiment higher than those more negatively regarded.




GEO Implementation Strategies: How to Get it Right?



Many of the most impactful strategies for GEO focus on developing and distributing high-quality content that aligns with and supports the authority of your brand. Think of your content as the backbone of your GEO strategy. 



Research & Planning



To create content that resonates with your audience and will be relevant to their queries, you must start with research:




Discover User Questions: Map the long-tail, question-based queries people ask about your industry. Tools like AnswerThePublic, Semrush’s “Questions” feature, and even direct prompts to ChatGPT or Perplexity can yield potential user phrasing.



Identify AI Engine Types: Pinpoint whether your audience is more likely to use ChatGPT’s offline data or Bing Chat’s real-time engine. This dictates your approach to content freshness and domain authority.



Competitor Analysis: Ask generative engines about your competitors. Check how they appear in responses. Identify gaps you can exploit.



Brand Perception: Dig into how your brand is perceived by those who are searching in your niche. Understand what people are saying about your brand so you can grasp the current sentiment and figure out where you may need to make changes.




Content Creation & Structuring



What you include in your content and how you structure it directly impacts how LLMs are able to understand your relevance to and your expertise on a certain topic. Focus heavily on providing detailed, thoughtful, and original perspectives on important topics in your industry.



When structuring your content, you should:




Provide Direct Answers: Start content pieces with a concise, “TL;DR”-style summary. AI often lifts these for quick responses.



Use Clear Headings: Group subtopics with H2/H3 labels so LLMs can easily identify relevant sections.



Include Original Data & Quotes: Studies show that LLMs prefer referencing content with statistics, quotes, or unique angles.



Multi-Format Approach: Embed videos, infographics, or tables for depth; advanced models can incorporate them into answers.



Incorporate FAQ Sections: Build FAQ sections, especially in longer content, to address common questions and make it easy for AI to pull relevant information.




Optimizing for Different Generative AI Engine Types



Training-Based Models (ChatGPT, Claude, Llama) rely on a set library of knowledge, usually with a cut-off date. To optimize for these models, consider long-term and evergreen approaches:




Get your brand into widely crawled sources (news outlets, authoritative databases).



Focus on timeless, high-authority content that remains valid well after the model’s training cutoff.




Real-Time & Hybrid Models (Perplexity, Bing Chat, Gemini, ChatGPT with browsing) can browse the internet as they’re processing a query to build the most relevant response. Focus on more immediate fixes and updates to optimize for these models, such as:




Technical SEO Best Practices: Fresh, indexed content is essential; site speed, structured data, and mobile optimization are also critical for AI to quickly parse and synthesize information on your website.



Timely Updates: Publish frequent updates, new research, or product info so the real-time crawler picks it up. Consistent and timely content publishing ensures you stay relevant in your particular industry.




Distribution & Community Building



Today with the rise of GEO, community building has become the new link building. Since LLMs are trained on a wide variety of data from all corners of the internet, make sure to amplify and take part into your brand discussions beyond your website:




Active Forum Participation: Contribute meaningfully on Reddit, Quora, and niche communities.



Social Media Seeding: Post share-worthy insights on LinkedIn or industry-specific networks.



Guest Podcasts & Webinars: Voice your expertise in events that might be transcribed and then included in AI training sets.




Testing & Iteration



Many AI models are still being trained, new AI models are being released, and new features are being added to the ones that already exist. Keep close tabs on your GEO strategy implementation and test where necessary to ensure you’re seeing results:




Prompt Experiments: Regularly ask ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. about your brand or key topics. Track if you appear and in what context.



Refine & Re-Test: Adjust content structure or brand mentions and test again. This cyclical process is crucial for incremental GEO improvements.



Collaboration with R&D: If your company has data scientists or partnerships with AI tool providers, collaborate to see how training sets are curated.




Case Studies and Practical Examples



Case Study 1: B2B SaaS Gains AI Mentions



A B2B SaaS company in the project management niche found they rarely appeared in ChatGPT’s offline knowledge. To remedy this, they:




Partnered with Industry Blogs: They published joint reports with tech sites that had high domain authority. 



Increased Wikipedia Presence: They created a well-cited Wikipedia entry referencing their white papers.




Result: Within the next model update cycle, ChatGPT began including them in the top “best project management tools” references, boosting direct brand searches by 25%.



Case Study 2: eCommerce Brand Optimizes for Perplexity



An eCommerce retailer specializing in eco-friendly lifestyle products noticed Perplexity was growing in popularity among sustainability-minded consumers. To drive inclusion of their brand in Perplexity’s results, they implemented:




Structured FAQ: They added custom FAQ schema with concise Q&A blocks to their product pages.



Community Advocacy: They encouraged satisfied customers to share experiences on subreddits like r/ZeroWaste.




Result: In under two months, the brand appeared consistently in Perplexity’s “top eco-friendly stores” suggestions, correlating with an 18% bump in monthly revenue.



Case Study 3: Consultancy & Hybrid Systems



A consultancy wanted to rank in Google Gemini and also appear in ChatGPT’s real-time browsing variant. To achieve this, they focused on:




Weekly Thought Leadership: They posted in-depth blog posts on trending management topics, ensuring daily crawls by Google.



Citation Seeds: They proactively commented on Fortune 500 LinkedIn posts, dropping relevant data bites that earned them news coverage.



Result: Gemini frequently included their quotes, and ChatGPT-with-browsing began citing their blog for “up-to-date leadership insights.”




How to Measure GEO and AI Visibility



Measuring success in GEO can feel elusive if you’re used to the more stable metrics of traditional SEO. While SEO performance may shift on a weekly or monthly basis, GEO is even more inherently dynamic—AI answers can shift from day to day, or even query to query.



Key Metrics




AI Citation Frequency

How often does the model mention or source your brand?



Does it list your domain as a reference or recommended link?





Brand Visibility in AI Overviews

Are you recommended in relevant top-tier queries? (e.g., “best enterprise software solutions”)



Does your brand appear in “buying guide” or “how-to” generative answers?





Post-AI Direct Traffic

When AI references your brand, do you see a spike in branded searches or direct visits?



Do you see an increase in brand + product name queries? This is a solid sign of AI-driven awareness.





Referral Data

Some AI chat interfaces provide clickable citations. Monitor referral traffic from these sources.





User Engagement

Keep an eye on lead volume, time on site, or newsletter sign-ups. Sometimes, AI references warm up leads before they even arrive.






Monitoring Tools & Methods



A strong GEO strategy requires established methods for measuring performance and impact of optimizations. Consider the following to track visibility:




Prompt Testing: Manually check responses by asking the AI about your brand or relevant keywords.



Brand Mention Tools: Invest in a tool from the new wave of software that specifically tracks brand references in generative AI outputs.



Analytics: Use Google Analytics (and similar) to monitor direct traffic spikes; use Google Search Console to track brand search volume.



Social Listening: Incorporate a tool that tracks social sentiment and discussions that could feed into AI training sets.




Goodie AI for Visibility Analysis



Goodie AI is an emerging platform that helps brands gain insights into how they show up in generative AI outputs. It offers:

Future of GEO and AI Search: Closing Thoughts



Generative AI is rapidly transforming how people search, research, and make decisions. Far from a temporary hype cycle, LLMs are already mainstream and improving continuously with each iteration. This means:




Data Quality & Freshness Will Become Essential: AI engines that rely on real-time data will increasingly factor in recency and reliability. Maintaining updated content is critical.



Deeper Personalization Is on the Horizon: Future AI systems may tailor their responses based on the user’s past interactions, location, or personal preferences. Optimizing for broader “personas” might become as important as keyword targeting once was.



Voice & Visual Inputs Will Blend With Text: As voice-based and image-based queries increase, GEO strategies will expand to cover multimodal content optimization.



Ethical & Trust Factors Will Be Increasingly Important: Misinformation and AI “hallucinations” remain hot-button issues. Brands that prove trustworthiness—through robust references, transparency, and verified credentials—will likely earn preferential treatment from AI systems looking to minimize errors.



Standardization Could Emerge: As generative AI matures, there may be regulations or standard practices for citing sources—akin to how search engines have guidelines for indexing.




The Bottom Line



Generative Engine Optimization isn’t just “SEO with a twist.” It’s a new frontier that intersects branding, content strategy, technical optimization, and community influence. In an era when user queries can be answered entirely within a chat window, ensuring that your brand’s perspective informs that answer can make the difference between winning a new lead or never being discovered at all.



By focusing on quality content, structured data, brand authority, and active community engagement, you position your organization to capitalize on the AI revolution—rather than be sidelined by it. Embrace GEO now to protect and amplify your brand’s digital visibility for the next decade and beyond.

As social media misfits that are never not plugged into TikTok, we offer the highest level of community outreach and management, so that your brand stays involved across all your followers and communities.

                                We’ve cracked the code for efficient performance economics and ROAS on TikTok with our experiment-learn-scale approach.

Our media spend is backed by content strategy and experimentation to make sure that we are using real-time learnings to continuously produce the highest quality content possible.

                                        Similar to other marketing channels, competition has increased across the most prevalent social channels over the last few years, which has, in turn, led to increased costs. NoGood’s unique approach lies in leveraging various social channels rather than putting all advertising dollars behind Facebook/Instagram. NoGood has been nimble in spearheading channel diversification for our clients, leading to deeper and more holistic insights that drive our advertising campaigns. Finding resources to understand and manage across all the available social media platforms is no easy task.

Google’s advancements in artificial intelligence have forever reshaped SEO and organic traffic. Google’s integration of AI technologies into its search engine, previously Search Generative Experience (SGE), marks a shift in how users interact with search results.



As AI evolves—I mean, even Bing just launched its version of AI Overviews, its impact on SEO strategies becomes increasingly significant, requiring marketers to stay informed and adapt to maintain and grow their organic search presence.



What is Google AI Overview



Google AI encompasses a suite of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies developed by Google to enhance various products and services. Google AI’s core is its ability to analyze and interpret vast amounts of data to improve user experiences. The technology leverages advanced models like BERT and RankBrain to better understand and process user queries, delivering more accurate and relevant search results.



Essentially, Google’s search algorithms use AI to enhance their ability to interpret and respond to user queries. RankBrain, introduced in 2015, was Google’s first AI component. It was designed to understand the intent behind search queries by analyzing previous searches and their outcomes. This helps provide relevant results even for queries that do not explicitly match the keywords. BERT, another AI model, improves the understanding of natural language by considering the context of words within a query, allowing Google to interpret complex or conversational searches better.

Understanding the Impact of Google AI Summaries on Organic Traffic



What Impact is Google AI Expected to Have on Organic Traffic?



Google’s AI-driven SGE will profoundly impact organic traffic. By providing users with AI-generated summaries directly in the search results, SGE will reduce the need for users to click through to individual websites to get the information they seek, effectively increasing zero-click searches. This shift would decrease organic traffic for many sites, as users may find sufficient answers directly within the SERPs.



The implementation of SGE can lead to significant traffic drops for certain types of content. Risk assessments indicate that websites heavily reliant on organic search traffic could experience a decline ranging from 25% to 50%. This is particularly evident for informational queries, where users typically seek quick answers. 



For example, when users search for “OOH marketing,” they might receive a comprehensive AI-generated summary that negates the need to visit a specific website. Let’s take a closer look at this example. 



Ahrefs just launched a new feature to help SEOs navigate the impact of Google AI Overviews. If you head to your top pages using the tool, you can now check the content changes section. According to Ahrefs, the SERP has majorly changed since publishing our article, indicating the need for us to optimize this article based on Google AI’s influence (which we’ll discuss below). 



<img decoding=""async"" width=""2784"" height=""563"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1.png"" alt=""Ahrefs Google AI overview feature"" class=""wp-image-42603"" style=""width:900px"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1.png 2784w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-1920x388.png 1920w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-1080x218.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-700x142.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-1400x283.png 1400w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-540x109.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-160x32.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/NG_0801_Marketing_Guide_Google_Image2-1-320x65.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 2784px) 100vw, 2784px"">



If we look at the new search results, this statement rings true.

As you can see, these AI summaries aim to offer quick and comprehensive overviews of topics, which means users might rely more on the information provided by Google without visiting multiple sources. This could particularly affect websites that rely heavily on organic search traffic for visibility and visitor engagement.



According to Aleyda Solis’s research, three main types of SGE snapshots affect ranked pages differently. The risk assessment for traffic drop varies depending on the snapshot type:



1. Direct Answer Snapshots: These provide straightforward answers to user queries. Websites that previously benefited from high traffic volumes due to such queries might see traffic drop up to 50%.









For example, while previously being able to gain traffic or impressions from featured snippets, these questions will most likely now be answered directly by Google’s AI. 



2. Exploration Snapshots: These offer users multiple perspectives on a topic, potentially reducing click-through rates by 30-40% as users get diverse answers directly from the search page.









Exploration snapshots are usually relevant and authoritative while being contextually relevant to the user’s search query. For example, blog articles, tutorials, or other high-quality resources.



3. Deep Dive Snapshots: These give in-depth coverage of a topic, which might lead to a 25-35% reduction in organic traffic as the need for further clicks is minimized. 



This is the type of content a user clicks on and doesn’t need to navigate to other pages afterward as they’d be satisfied. This includes research papers, expert opinions, blog articles, and more.









How Ranking Factors Have Changed with the Introduction of Google AI



The introduction of Google AI has led to a shift in how ranking factors are evaluated and prioritized. Traditional SEO practices focused on keyword optimization, backlink quality, and other on-page and off-page factors. However, with the integration of AI, there is a stronger emphasis on content relevance, context, and user intent.



<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3_2.png"" alt=""Google's search generative experience"" class=""wp-image-30943"" style=""width:800px"">



As mentioned, Google AI uses advanced models that understand context and semantics better than any previous algorithms. This means that the quality and depth of content have become more critical than merely matching keywords. Additionally, AI helps Google better interpret complex and conversational queries, which changes how websites should optimize their content to meet these new standards.



One significant change driven by Google AI is the rise of zero-click experiences. These occur when users find the information they need directly in the search results without clicking through to a website. This phenomenon has increased due to AI’s ability to generate concise and comprehensive answers to queries directly within the SERPs. 



As a result, businesses must adapt their SEO strategies to remain visible and valuable, where user engagement might not always translate into website visits. This shift impacts traditional success metrics, such as click-through rates, and necessitates a focus on optimizing content for direct visibility within the SERPs.

How Google AI Influences SEO Practices + Actionable Steps



1. Keyword Optimization



With the advent of SGE and other AI advancements, keyword optimization is evolving. Traditional keyword stuffing or overly simplistic keyword strategies are less effective. Instead, the focus is shifting towards creating content that naturally incorporates keywords in a meaningful context. AI algorithms prioritize content that answers user queries comprehensively and contextually rather than just matching keywords.



Actionable Steps




I’ve seen many outlines that include specific keywords writers or content marketers need to include in specific sections. Instead of spending time adding keywords for writers, spend time researching topics related to your general query – you can use social search as a starting point. For example, look at TikTok or Quora to find out what users are interested in, which is below your umbrella term. Adding more relevant questions for the writer to focus on will help them steer clear of keyword stuffing, and I’ve found the result to be that the article sounds more human-written, natural, and in-depth. 



After reviewing the drafted article, you can now start adding keywords naturally. I know it’s hard not to focus on a “keyword content score,” but I’d say this is becoming less and less important as more top-ranking people often have lower keyword content scores. 



Don’t change the context of the writers’ draft (except if it makes sense regarding the search intent) to make a long-tail keyword fit. 




2. Content Quality



Content quality has always been important, but Google AI’s ability to understand and evaluate content has raised the bar. High-quality content that is informative, well-structured, and authoritative is more likely to be featured in AI-generated summaries. Google AI favors content that provides in-depth analysis, clear answers, and trustworthy information. AKA, Investing in high-quality content creation is crucial for maintaining visibility in search results. 



Actionable Steps




The skyscraper content technique is dead (taking the top-ranking content and just improving it a little). You have to be able to give a thought leadership point of view. 



Doing more in-depth research is more important than ever before. For example, one way to ensure that your content is informative and authoritative is to get quotes from internal or external sources. While this can also help shape your article, it will differentiate it, too, while adding an extra layer of expertise. Think about it: if your agency is putting out content on a specific topic, you most likely have a bunch of internal experts to tap for this assignment. 




3. User Experience



User experience (UX) is increasingly significant in SEO due to Google AI’s ability to assess how users interact with content. Factors like page load speed, mobile-friendliness, and overall site usability are critical in ranking. Google’s AI evaluates user engagement metrics like bounce rate, time on page, and interaction rates to determine the quality of the user experience. Websites that offer a seamless and engaging experience are more likely to rank higher in search results.



Actionable Steps




Even though we’ll be covering the more technical side of SXO below, the one thing to note here is to create content that doesn’t read like generative AI created it. Above all of the technical factors, nobody wants to read an article starting with “In the ever-evolving digital marketing landscape, marketing has become essential.” Besides negatively influencing the user experience, you’re also standing a chance to be viewed by Google as a site using abusive tactics to manipulate search results, which is called scaled content abuse. 



Make use of tools to monitor the on-site performance of specific pages, such as Hotjar and Microsoft Clarity. Even though you probably have a lot of data on the performance of these, having an in-depth view of how users are reacting to your content will surely improve your content optimization skills. 




4. Zero-Click Experiences



The rise of zero-click searches means more users are finding the information they need without leaving the SERPs. This trend, driven by AI’s ability to generate instant answers, requires businesses to rethink their SEO strategies. Instead of focusing solely on driving traffic to their websites, businesses need to ensure their content is visible and authoritative enough to be featured directly in the search results. This includes optimizing for featured snippets, knowledge panels, and other rich results that AI tends to populate with direct answers.



Actionable Steps




Position yourself as an authority in the space – easier said than done, right? Once you become a recognizable and trustworthy brand that constantly pushes out helpful content (that users can’t get from an AI summary), users are more likely to click through to your site. 



Offer downloadable resources while promoting this in your meta descriptions to motivate users to click through to your site.

How to Rank in Google AI Summaries: Best Practices



Search Engines vs. Answer Engines



Traditional search engines focus on matching keyword queries with relevant web pages, prioritizing factors like keyword density, backlinks, and meta tags. With the rise of answer engines, the focus shifts towards holistically understanding and addressing user intent. 



Answer engines aim to provide direct, concise, and contextually relevant responses, often summarized from multiple sources, thus emphasizing content comprehensiveness, relevance, and user satisfaction over simple keyword optimization.



On-Page Optimization Tips for Google AI Summaries



<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2_3.png"" alt='Google AI overview box of ""how to start a business""' class=""wp-image-30941"" style=""width:800px"">



1. Content Format & Style



High-quality content is fundamental to ranking in Google AI summaries. This involves:




Depth and Breadth:  Ensure your content covers topics comprehensively. Provide detailed explanations, examples, and insights. Google’s AI is more likely to see comprehensive content as authoritative and helpful.



Authenticity and Engagement: Write in a way that engages readers. Use a conversational tone where appropriate, and avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary. Authentic content that resonates with readers tends to perform better.



Visuals and Media: Incorporate images, videos, infographics, and other media to enhance content quality. Visual aids help break down complex information and improve user engagement, making your content more attractive to Google’s AI.



Content Freshness: Ensure your data is up to date across owned assets and visuals. 




2. Reverse Engineer User Intent and Create a Helpful Experience



To create content that meets the H.E.E.A.T (Helpfulness, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) criteria:




User Intent Analysis: Understand what users seek when they type specific queries. Use tools like Google Analytics, Search Console, and keyword research tools to gain insights into user behavior and preferences. During this step, it’s also important to note the format in which users prefer their content. For example, say a user is looking for influencer marketing collaboration tips. Are they expecting a lengthy blog article or a video summary?



Helpfulness: Ensure your content directly answers users’ questions. Provide actionable insights, step-by-step guides, and practical tips that users can apply immediately.



Expertise and Authority: Highlight your expertise by citing credible sources, including case studies, statistics, and expert opinions. Authoritative content is more likely to be featured in AI summaries.



Trustworthiness: Build trust by ensuring your content is accurate, up-to-date, and error-free. Include author bios, references, and links to reputable sources to enhance credibility.




3. Structuring Content for Featured Snippets & Knowledge Graphs



<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/9_image-16.png"" alt=""Structuring content for featured snippets and knowledge graphs"" class=""wp-image-30944"" style=""width:800px"">



To increase the likelihood of your content being featured in snippets and knowledge graphs:




Clear Headings and Subheadings: Use descriptive headings and subheadings to organize your content. This helps Google understand the structure and main points of your article.



Concise Answers: Answer common questions directly in your content. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and short paragraphs to make the information easily digestible.



Rich Media: Embed videos, images, and diagrams to complement your text. Multimedia elements can improve your chances of appearing in rich snippets and knowledge panels.




4. Leveraging Schema Markup to Enhance Content Visibility



Implementing schema markup helps search engines better understand your content:




Types of Schema: To categorize your content, use appropriate schema types like Article, FAQ, HowTo, and Product. This helps Google display your content in rich results formats.



Structured Data: Ensure your schema markup is correctly implemented and validated using tools like Google’s Structured Data Testing Tool. Properly structured data can significantly enhance your content’s visibility in search results.




5. Improve Site Speed and Mobile Responsiveness



Site performance is crucial for both user experience and SEO:




Page Speed Optimization: Optimize your website’s load times by compressing images, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and leveraging browser caching. Fast-loading pages are favored by both users and search engines. 



Mobile-Friendliness: Use responsive design to ensure your site is mobile-friendly. Google prioritizes mobile-first indexing, making mobile optimization essential for SEO success. 




6. Product Feeds



Product feeds are becoming increasingly important for Ecommerce sites in the context of Google AI. Google’s AI leverages product feeds to provide users with up-to-date product information directly within search results:




Comprehensive and Accurate Data: Ensure your product feeds are comprehensive and regularly updated with accurate data. Include product name, price, availability, images, and descriptions. This helps Google present the most relevant and accurate information to users.



Structured Product Data: Format your product information using structured data markup (e.g., JSON-LD). This helps Google’s AI understand and display your products more effectively.



Optimization for Google Shopping: Optimize your product listings for Google Shopping by including high-quality images, competitive pricing, and clear product descriptions. Ensuring your product feed aligns with Google’s requirements can enhance visibility in search results.



Integration with Merchant Center: Regularly update and manage your product feed through Google Merchant Center. This integration ensures your products are eligible for display in various Google Shopping experiences, including the SGE.



Review Prioritization: Prioritize integrating reviews into your marketing strategy as they significantly influence product visibility in search results. Google views reviews as endorsements from satisfied customers, so emphasizing customer feedback and responsiveness will boost your product page listings.

Off-Page Optimization Tips for Google AI



1. Forced Indexing



Once a page is updated, force a re-indexation request via Google Search Console. Being up-to-date and showing consistent optimization will benefit your site when battling for the top spot in search results. Using the inspection tool, you can request Google to index your site to see newly added information or improvements to user experience. 



While forcing indexing, it’s important to note that for specific keywords, like trendy ones, your content has to be kept updated with new, relevant information, as Google AI prioritizes showing the most helpful content.



2. Brand Reputation Management & Digital PR



While backlinks are still important, modern off-page SEO strategies focus more on overall brand reputation and visibility. Effective tactics include:




Guest Posting on High-Authority Sites: Contribute high-quality content to reputable websites in your industry. This not only builds backlinks but also establishes your authority and reach.



HARO Technique: Help a Reporter Out (HARO) is a free platform you can use to answer reporters or other writers’ questions with short answers so they can use it to quote you in their articles. This will also strengthen your brand image and help position yourself as a leader in your niche.



Industry Awards and Recognition: Find industry awards and recognitions to boost your credibility. Highlighting these accolades on your website can improve trust and authority.



Influencer Marketing for Brand Amplification: Collaborate with influencers to reach a broader audience. Influencer endorsements can significantly enhance your brand’s visibility and credibility. 



Affiliate Sites, Awards, & Listicles: Get featured in authoritative listicles and award sites. Being listed as a top product or service can drive traffic and improve brand perception.

Strategies for Adapting to Algorithm Changes Driven by AI




Monitoring Algorithm Updates and Their Impacts
Staying informed about the latest algorithm updates is essential. Check for announcements and analyses from reputable sources like Google’s own blogs regularly. Understanding the changes allows you to adjust your SEO strategies proactively and mitigate any negative impacts on your site’s rankings.



Maintaining a Focus on User Intent and Relevance
With AI-driven algorithms prioritizing user intent, creating content that addresses your audience’s needs and questions is more important than ever. Use tools like Google’s Search Console and keyword research tools to gain insights into what users are searching for and tailor your content to meet these needs.



Adjusting SEO Strategies Based on Emerging Trends
As AI continues to shape SEO, adapting to new trends is crucial. This includes optimizing for things like voice search as AI-powered voice assistants become more prevalent. Incorporate natural language keywords and phrases into your content to capture voice search traffic.



Content Diversification
Diversifying your content can help you reach a broader audience and improve engagement. Include various content types such as blogs, videos, infographics, and podcasts. This caters to different user preferences and enhances your site’s visibility in search results. Google’s AI favors rich, diverse content that provides comprehensive information. From here, you can use your own internal data to establish which type of content works best for you, as it’s often more effective than relying on external data. 




By staying updated on algorithm changes, focusing on user intent, and diversifying your content, you can effectively navigate Google’s evolving search algorithm and maintain strong SEO performance.

                            Search engines are now becoming ""answer engines"" — zero click user UIs powered by generative AI. Here’s how to optimize for this new landscape of search.

With the rise of Generative AI, the future of search has been a buzzword over the past year. ChatGPT, the fastest-growing platform in history, has become the go-to place for users to ask questions and get quick answers to their hyper-specific search queries. According to a study conducted by UBS, ChatGPT has set a record for the fastest-growing user base for a consumer application, reaching 100 million users in just 2 months after its initial launch in November of 2022. As of May 2023, ChatGPT website reached 2 billion monthly visits.

Following the meteoric rise of ChatGPT, we’re beginning to see the emergence of what we call “answer engines” — large language models, AI systems or voice search technologies that provide a singular response to users’ questions without requiring them to click on a blue link. Consumers are no longer scrolling through search engine results pages to look for the right articles or websites that might answer their original search query; they can simply ask ChatGPT or Bard and get a response within a few seconds.







Despite search being the principal traffic driver for brands online (claiming around 50% of traffic for most companies), the landscape is changing. Traditional search is morphing into LLM powered answer engines. The likes of ChatGPT and Bard are now the preferred alternatives for many, including myself, offering a zero-click, personalized response rather than impersonal multiple choices. (we covered this here before).



This rapid evolution in search has left many marketing strategies lagging. Brands are yet to pivot their strategies to answer engine optimization.



Enter the era of AEO!



What is AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)?



AEO, or Answer Engine Optimization, refers to the practice of optimizing content to provide direct and relevant zero click answers to user queries. This can be on a large language model powered Chatbots like Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT, conventional search engine results pages like Google or Bing or voice search assistants like Alexa or Siri. 



AEO is sometimes also known as LLMO, or Large Language Model Optimization, the process of optimizing large language models (LLMs) and influencing its learning and training data and feedback loop to ensure that your brand is present intentionally where it needs to be. It’s arguably a subfield or an evolution of SEO (search engine optimization), with a similar principle of needing to understand the user’s search intent and how best to answer it. While AEO shares a common goal with SEO to provide highly useful content that answers users’ queries as accurately and concisely as possible, AEO specifically focuses on creating content that is a direct answer to the question, is easily readable and understood by AI answer engines like Bard or ChatGPT. 



We are therefore witnessing the shift from search engines (e.g. Google, Bing) to answer engines (e.g. Bard, ChatGPT) as the primary source information on the web. With the move to answer engines, brands have to leverage AEO and think about how their story is being told by these answer engines, as well as how they can optimize the LLM for the optimal brand result.



Examples of Popular Answer Engines:




ChatGPT by Open AI



Bard by Google



Bing (powered by ChatGPT)



Siri by Apple (Voice)



Alexa by Amazon (Voice)



Google Assistant (Voice)



Poe by Quora




Answer engines essentially eliminate the need to click on blue links, open tabs, and filter through a wealth of information in order to find the right answer to your question. The future of search no longer lies in blue links and SERPs; to understand the future of search is to understand how answer engines are being used and how you can effectively optimize for them.

                                            What’s included with NoGood PPC campaign management services?

                                            What makes PPC marketing different from SEO?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Unlike search engine optimization (SEO), PPC execution requires a designated daily, weekly, and monthly budget. These ads often appear at the top of a SERP, and you only pay when users click on your ads.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What can I expect from NoGood’s PPC advertising services?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Here at NoGood, our PPC specialists all have a minimum of 5 years of experience and have worked across numerous industries and clients.

                                            Why is PPC challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Due to increasing competition over time, PPC costs have significantly increased. Without proper campaign structure, keyword research, bid strategy, and high-quality landing pages, PPC campaigns are sure to cost you more — but a PPC management company with deep channel expertise can help you unlock cost-effective and quick results even in the most saturated space. Partnering with an agency like NoGood will guarantee you PPC services that are efficient and profitable.

                    Overview

                				 
                
                    
                        SteelSeries is a global leader in gaming accessories, known for premium headsets, keyboards and mice, trusted by esports athletes and gamers worldwide. As AI search platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity began reshaping product discovery, SteelSeries recognized a critical inflection point: these platforms were becoming the new front door for gaming gear research but SteelSeries visibility was not matching market presence. 
While competitors scrambled to understand this emerging channel, SteelSeries partnered with NoGood in late 2024 to pioneer AEO strategy that would establish brand dominance before the market caught up. 
                    

                				
				 
            
        
    








    
        
            
                

    
            
    
            


            
        
    








    
        
            

                
                    The Challenge

                				 
                
                    
                        
Absence from AI conversations: SteelSeries had an inconsistent presence and low rankings in AI responses for gaming accessory queries, despite strong traditional SEO performance.
Competitors claiming territory: Rival brands were beginning to appear in AI recommendations, threatening market position in this emerging channel.
No established playbook: AI platforms had different citation behaviors, sourcing patterns, and optimization requirements than traditional search engines.
Proving business value: Demonstrate that AI visibility translates to measurable traffic and revenue, not just vanity metrics.
Speed to market: Establish dominance quickly before competitors invested in AEO strategies.

                                Within 10 months, SteelSeries went from a relatively low SoV and visibility score across leading models to becoming one of the most-cited gaming accessories brands across major AI platforms. More importantly, AI search became a measurable, scalable revenue channel; not just a visibility play.
Business Impact: Starting from baseline levels in January 2025, AI traffic grew 6.7X to over 1,500 daily visitors by October 2025. Conversion rates from AI traffic exceeded traditional search benchmarks, driving a 7.1X increase in conversions from AI platforms and establishing a new high-intent acquisition channel.
AI Platform Visibility:

Gemini Visibility Score: 62 → 85 (+37%)
ChatGPT Visibility Score: 51 → 73 (+43%)
Perplexity Visibility Score: 44 → 77 (+75%)

Market Position: SteelSeries now dominates gaming accessories recommendations across AI platforms, appearing in the majority of relevant AI-generated responses. This first-mover advantage positions them ahead of competitors who are only beginning to invest in AEO, creating a compounding moat as AI platforms reinforce existing authoritative citations.

                                We debunk the notion that creative and analytics don’t mix.
Our agile squad model combines creative brand strategy with data-driven performance to deliver long-term value across all channels and touchpoints. We are constantly testing creative brand basics with audience data. We use quick experiments at each stage of a performance funnel. This helps us maximize ROI and increase brand LTV.

                                Drive revenue while maintaining a standard of strong brand equity.
We focus on metrics like ad lift, brand recall, consideration, and purchase intent to improve your conversion funnel. We don’t see profitability as a reason to compromise quality. Instead, we build strong brands that hold their own over time and consistently improve ROAS while driving down CPA.

                                            What is performance branding?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Performance branding incorporates brand thinking and applies creative brand rules within a measurable performance funnel to maximize revenue potential and increase LTV.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What is the value of a performance branding agency?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Performance branding incorporates performance, which is purely data-focused, with branding, which is people-focused and represents a company’s values, reputation, and trustworthiness.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What are the main objectives with performance branding?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Companies want to implement performance branding for the following reasons: build brand equity on the back of your media dollars, increase retention numbers and overall LTV, and use performance and creative in unison to reach rapid growth.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is performance branding challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Performance marketing is hard. Branding is hard. Now, imagine trying to find a strategy between both channels to drive success.

                                            How does B2B marketing work?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        B2B marketing is the process of advertising products or services to other businesses. Marketing tactics such as SEO, paid social media, PPC, and email are all used in B2B marketing, but the strategic approach to implementing these channels is unique for B2B businesses because of the long customer journey.

                                        Sales teams and relationship building drove B2B growth in the past, often making marketing an afterthought. Sales teams and relationship building still matter, but executing marketing tactics such as content creation, lead generation, and data management is now key. Although marketing may still follow sales in importance in a B2B business, brands are increasingly recognizing the importance of investing in a robust marketing plan.

                                            Why is B2B marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Businesses that sell to other companies often have a specific niche of potential customers, limiting audience reach and increasing competition. Also, B2B decision-makers often have multiple interactions with a brand before deciding to purchase, making the sales cycle much longer and requiring more marketing resources.

For years, Google dominated the search landscape so thoroughly that “Googling” became synonymous with searching the internet. But that dominance is starting to shift. As new platforms and search behaviors emerge, a new era of optimization is taking shape: Answer Engine Optimization, or AEO.



AEO has risen alongside the meteoric growth of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Gemini, AI-generated summaries such as Google’s AI Overview, and the widespread adoption of voice assistants like Alexa and Siri. Instead of scrolling through pages of blue links or browsing multiple websites, users now expect immediate, well-packaged answers to their queries—all in one place. 



This shortening of the search process is making a huge impact on the future trajectory of search and demands that businesses rethink how they’re optimizing their content to surface on search engine (or, more accurately, answer engine) results. For marketers and businesses, this means rethinking traditional SEO strategies and learning how to optimize for the platforms that are now delivering answers instead of links.

What Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is and how it differs from traditional SEO



The rise of answer engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, Alexa, and Siri—and how they’re changing user search behavior



Why the shift from search engines to answer engines matters for brands and marketers




What is Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)?



AEO, or Answer Engine Optimization, refers to the practice of optimizing content to provide direct zero-click answers to user queries. This can be on a Generative AI-powered chatbot like Gemini or ChatGPT, AI-generated search engine summaries like Google AI Overview, or voice search assistants like Alexa or Siri. 



As modern search behavior shifts toward direct answers, optimization strategies must also evolve, focusing on the user’s intent and delivering relevant, useful content tailored to the platform where the query is made. Answer engine optimization is therefore the process of optimizing generative AI chatbots and large language models (LLMs), influencing their learning and training data and feedback loop to ensure that your brand is intentionally present in the right spaces at the right times.



AEO is arguably a subfield or an evolution of search engine optimization (SEO), with a similar principle of needing to understand the user’s search intent and how best to answer it. While AEO shares a common goal with SEO to provide highly useful content that answers users’ queries as accurately and concisely as possible, AEO specifically focuses on creating content that is a direct answer to the question so that it’s easily readable, crawlable, and presentable by AI answer engines and voice search assistants.



What is an Answer Engine?



Before we get into the specifics of how to leverage answer engine optimization to power your business growth, let’s clarify what exactly an answer engine is and how the cultural shift from search engines to answer engines came about.



An answer engine harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to understand the user’s query and deliver a direct answer, eliminating the need for users to sift through multiple search results.

While traditional search engines like Google and Bing provide a list of relevant web pages in response to a query, answer engines take it a step further by directly providing concise and accurate answers to specific questions — all with zero-clicks and little to no wait time. These engines are designed to provide instant and precise responses, making them invaluable tools for quick and efficient information retrieval. 



Whether you need to know the weather forecast, the capital of a country, or the definition of a word, an answer engine can provide you with the answer in a matter of seconds, revolutionizing the way we seek and consume information.



What are Some Examples of Answer Engines?



There are two main categories of answer engines: generative AI bots such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude etc., and AI-powered voice search assistants such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. 



Gen AI uses sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms to generate human-like responses to queries. These answer engines excel at understanding and generating textual information, making them valuable resources for answering a wide range of questions.

AI Chatbots: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, etc.



The most prominent example of an answer engine is ChatGPT. OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November of 2022, and it quickly gained traction, capturing the interest of researchers, developers, and users alike. It set the record for being the fastest-growing platform in history, reaching 100 million users two months after its initial launch, becoming the go-to place for users to ask questions and get quick answers to hyper-specific search queries. 



By 2025, ChatGPT had climbed to become the most downloaded app in the App store, surpassing long-time leaders Instagram and TikTok for the first time.

The model’s ability to engage in dynamic conversations and provide coherent responses made it a breakthrough in Gen AI. Users interact with ChatGPT by simply inputting text prompts and receiving detailed and informative answers. While ChatGPT is praised for its conversational abilities, it also comes with limitations, such as occasional inaccuracies or generating responses that may seem plausible but are not factually correct.



Following the success of ChatGPT, other major AI players such as Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, and more began to enter the space, further popularizing the use of AI chatbots as a primary method of information search and discovery.



AI-Powered Voice Search Assistants: Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant



Another type of answer engine separate from chatbots is AI-powered voice search assistants. These answer engines utilize voice recognition technology to understand spoken queries and provide immediate responses. 



With a simple voice command, users can ask questions, get directions, set reminders, and perform various tasks without touching a screen. Voice search assistants provide quick and convenient answers, catering to users who prefer hands-free interaction and real-time information. 



As these assistants continue to evolve and improve, they become an essential part of our everyday lives, seamlessly integrating into our homes, smartphones, and other smart devices.  Voice search assistants are already highly integrated into consumers’ daily lives, with 41% of the U.S. population using voice search daily. What’s more, 72% of people who own a voice search device say it has become a part of their daily routine, and 65% of people who own a Google Home or an Amazon Echo don’t want to go back to keyboard searches.

Why Did We Shift From Search Engines to Answer Engines?



The evolution from traditional search engines to answer engines represents a significant shift in how we seek and consume information. While search engines like Google and Bing have long been the go-to platforms for retrieving relevant web pages based on keyword queries, the rise of answer engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. 



This shift can be attributed to advancements in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, enabling answer engines to understand queries in a more nuanced manner and provide direct and accurate answers to specific questions.



One of the key drivers behind this shift is the increasing demand for instant and precise information. Traditional search engines present users with a list of relevant web pages, requiring them to navigate multiple sources to find the desired answer. This process can be time-consuming and often requires the user to skim through lengthy articles or websites. 



Answer engines, on the other hand, leverage AI algorithms to interpret the user’s query, extract relevant information, and deliver a concise answer. This streamlining of the search process eliminates the need for users to sift through search results, providing them with the desired information quickly and efficiently. In short, consumers are becoming more and more impatient — and answer engines are rising to the challenge to combat that desire for faster, more accurate information delivery.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""891"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2.png"" alt=""Table comparing answer engines and traditional search engines"" class=""wp-image-45304"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2-700x578.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2-540x446.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2-160x132.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image5-2-320x264.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">



The emergence of voice-enabled technologies has also played a significant role in the rise of answer engines. Voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant have made it effortless to ask questions and receive immediate answers. 



Users can simply speak their queries, and the AI-powered voice assistants leverage natural language understanding to provide spoken responses. This shift towards voice-based interaction has further propelled the demand for answer engines, as they offer hands-free access to information and cater to the growing preference for voice search.



What is the difference between answer engine optimization (AEO) and SEO?



The ultimate goal of both SEO and AEO remains the same: to optimize content to provide relevant and useful information in response to user queries. That being said, SEO and AEO are different in their approach to optimizing content for search engines, each with its own focus and objectives. 



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""953"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2.png"" alt=""Graphic showing the difference between using a search engine and using an answer engine"" class=""wp-image-45305"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2-700x618.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2-540x477.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2-160x141.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Image6-2-320x282.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">



SEO primarily revolves around improving website visibility and rankings on traditional search engines like Google and Bing. It involves optimizing various aspects such as keywords, featured snippets, structured data markup, link building, and site structure to ensure that a website ranks higher in search results pages. SEO aims to attract organic traffic by providing valuable and relevant content that matches user search queries, aiming to increase website visibility and drive traffic to the site.



On the other hand, AEO is a more specialized approach that specifically targets answer engines or AI-powered platforms that directly provide answers to user queries. AEO focuses on creating content that directly answers specific questions in a concise and accurate manner. 



It involves understanding user intent, optimizing content structure, and using language that is easily crawlable and comprehensible by AI answer engines like ChatGPT or Gemini. AEO aims to position content as the direct answer to user queries, ensuring it is easily discoverable and displayed prominently on answer engine platforms.

How to Perform Answer Engine Optimization for Your Business



With the rapidly increasing popularization of answer engines, brands and marketers must grasp the art of optimizing and influencing the outputs of these engines. You can begin by identifying, understanding, and influencing the data sources these engines rely on for training. AEO involves ensuring that the content and data you publish are easily accessible and can be utilized to train answer engines, enabling you to impact their output. This is where the power of community building and user-generated content shines, as socially validated content pieces can serve as the fundamental sources from which answer engines extract their information.



To truly comprehend what Gen AI deems an optimal answer, a valuable approach is to input the questions commonly asked by your target audience into the platforms they use for inquiry. By reverse-engineering the structure of your content based on the resultant answers, you can create a foundation that aligns with the expectations of users. To enhance the quality and value of your content, you can then infuse it with a unique brand perspective or add value that sets your business apart. This approach ensures that your content not only satisfies user queries but also adds a distinct touch that resonates with your brand identity.



The future of search is in AEO, so if you’re not already optimizing for answer engines, this is your sign to get started. Visit our Complete AEO Guide for more in-depth information on how to conduct answer engine optimization for your business, or contact us for more.

I’m sure you’ve heard of the many instances of e-commerce businesses failing to meet revenue goals or the increasing challenge of keeping acquisition costs down. It feels like everyone is going through a difficult time in the e-commerce world (a lot certainly are) — and attribution isn’t going to get better any time soon. This is a concept businesses have to accept, understand, and most importantly act on.



Arguably one of the latest, most impactful terms in the industry is zero party data (ZPD) — a new tool with a lot of potential. But here’s the thing: everyone’s talking about it and collecting it, but not everyone is using the data in an impactful way. The challenge we all face today is the lack of attribution and rising costs. How can we address that head-on?



Everyone talks about ZPD under the lens of personalization. “With ZPD, you can personalize all of your email flows, your retargeting ads, and so much more!”



While this is true, and it’s not a bad idea, there’s a truth most don’t realize at the very beginning of this process: the resources needed. In order to truly personalize your communication engine based on collected ZPD, you’re going to need a lot of resources around content creation simply just because of the many permutations of types of users you’ll likely be able to create from the combinations of your ZPD. 



Even if you keep this personalization “high level”, there is still a need to create more content and some teams simply don’t have the bandwidth to accomplish that in a reasonable amount of time. Throw in there the idea of AB testing + personalization, and you have yourself an immense list of tasks.



To clarify: I’m not saying personalization is a bad move. It’s a great move. It helps create more of a 1:1 relationship with your audience and likely increases the perceived value of the experience of interacting with your brand online. “Hey, they care about my interests. Nice!” I’m just saying it takes a lot of work and smaller teams may not be able to squeeze this orange to the fullest.



But you see, there is a way to squeeze this ZPD orange more efficiently by thinking beyond personalization functions. 



The issue that still needs to be addressed is attribution and rising costs.

While there are many attribution solutions out there that will help you understand your paid media landscape much better than just looking at native dashboards, it won’t necessarily bring down rising costs. The best way to do that is to achieve true relevancy with the audience generating the impressions for your ads.



What if we were to put that ZPD to use, not from a personalization perspective, but from an acquisition one. Why not use ZPD to dictate what our ads, landing pages, lead magnets, etc should consist of? Surely it would make a lot of sense to tie this data back to acquisition efforts so that we can achieve a better sense of relevancy across our paid media audiences. It makes complete sense. This is what we’re going to talk about today. A specific way to tie ZPD back to individual campaigns and even ads in order to make your ads more relevant, more clickable, and more importantly, cost-effective.





Zero Party Data Collection Strategy is Broken Down into 3 Steps:




Collecting the right data



Analyze the data to uncover revenue-based patterns



Impact and drive optimization decisions across the buying journey




1. Collecting the Right Data



You’ve probably seen dozens of e-commerce websites do this. You land on their homepage, you get attacked by an instant pop-up shoving a discount offer in your face. Alright, let’s say you bite. You enter your email in order to get the discount. Then, you immediately get asked for your phone number. This is very much a company-first approach to presenting things to a user on a site. Instead, we should think of a customer-first approach.



Do you really want to give out your phone number to a company as soon as you encounter them online? Is that maybe a bit early in the relationship? Do I really want to be presented with a pop-up AS SOON as I land on a site? I won’t go into detail about the company-first journey vs customer-first journey, but you can read more about it from folks like Jon Ivanko over on LinkedIn. He’s spearheading this concept and has a lot to say about it!



Not only is asking for email and SMS, not enough anymore (consumers now expect more personalization in their experiences online than before), but it also doesn’t give you data that allows you to create a better experience for them, nor does it give you anything to feed back into your acquisition efforts. 



Sure, you get an email and a phone number, so you can send them communications and you can upload them to FB for lookalike audiences. But, do you know what they care about? Do you know their interests? What pain points stop them from purchasing? This is far more valuable than a phone number if you think about it.



Also, what we’re really trying to collect is data that shows intent. While you could make the argument that the exchange of information for a discount code is showing intent (and we’d agree with that), you’re not tying any important data to that intent signal. This is where things get interesting.



Imagine a pop-up experience that is not annoying (strategic delays) and presents you with an offer that you’re interested in. It asks you for your email address and once you submit it you aren’t asked for your phone number. 



Instead, you’re presented with a series of relevant questions about your interests and what is important to you when shopping. Once you answer these simple questions, you are thanked and you’re given what was promised. The answers to these questions will give you far more context than just an email and phone number. We’ll touch on each question specifically later in this piece.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0526_ZPDReverse_Infographic1_1080x1080.png"" alt=""Quizzes can be a strategic tool for capturing zero-party data in an unobtrusive way. "" class=""wp-image-23024"">



Where would you like this popup? Well, it could be in several places. But the ones that make the most sense are the home page, the product page, the cart page, and on any landing page that you’re driving traffic to.



Homepage 



Consider a delay of 10 seconds or something along those lines. The goal here is to not annoy a brand new user with an instant popup. Instead, we give them some time to explore the page and what the brand is all about. A full-screen takeover probably makes the most sense here, as it gives the messaging good exposure and makes it clear to the user that there is an offer available.



Product page 



A longer delay here would make sense, as there likely is more detailed information on the product page for a user to consume. Give them the chance to do so before triggering a popup. 20-30 seconds might be good for this. Also, consider using a different format other than the full-screen takeover, as that will feel intrusive if done more than once. You could try a slide-out here which won’t feel like you’re forcing the user out of the experience.



Cart Page



This is meant for the users who have checked the cart page for specific reasons, like looking at all the items that are currently in the cart. This should trigger immediately on page load. Usually, this user may be ready to complete a purchase. You might be thinking, why would we show an offer to this user if he/she is ready to buy? Remember, good data is more valuable than any discount you give out. Also, this eliminates the negative feeling a user might have if they KNOW there is an offer available, but can’t get to it because they closed the earlier popup. Keep in mind we want to create a customer-first journey, not a company-first journey.



Landing Page 



Getting the most value out of every click you pay for always makes more sense. So, if you’re sending paid traffic to a landing page, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be capturing ZPD. Consider embedding the offer into the landing page, potentially higher in the page, and then also having a slideout offer that triggers on a percentage of the page scrolling. This way, users who miss the embedded offer toward the top, will see the slideout if they make it to the bottom of the content on the page. 



If you assume a 5% sign-up rate, and you get around 10,000 sessions per month and let’s say your experience contains 4 questions, then you’re looking at 500 subscribers per month with 4 powerful data points each. That’s enough to start giving you insights about how your brand should lead in terms of messaging and potentially even products.



It’s important that we take a minute to digest an important concept here. The offer experience always follows this format:




Offer + email submit form



Questions



Reward




It’s critical that we ask for the email upfront. Notice we’re not asking for a phone number. This is because that wouldn’t be a customer-first journey, and a phone number is something we will get anyways once they make a purchase, which is the entire point. Collecting data points early on just to collect them won’t have as much of an impact as collecting the right data and putting it to good use. But the main reason as to why we’re asking for an email upfront before the questions are because we want to tie these answers to purchase intent. 



If anyone exchanges their information for, for example, a discount, then that shows a clear sign of purchase intent. Why else would you want a discount? And by asking the questions at that same moment, you’re essentially capturing ZPD at the moment of intent. This is important to understand because this is the main reason why you can trust this data when making acquisition optimization decisions. Purchase intent is the key here.



Now that we’ve thought that through, we can talk about the questions. What exactly are we asking users? This is where things get very interesting. Let’s go one by one and talk about the purpose for each. 





Interests



What do you sell? Who do you sell it for? If you’re a jeans brand, “What styles are you interested in?”



People have different reasons for checking out and browsing an online store. By asking this question, we can learn about the user’s interest but more importantly, it narrows what kind of products the user is looking for. We can use this to present relevant content to them throughout their journey.



Benefits



How do people view your product offerings? Would you like to know what people care about the most when shopping online for your product category?



“What matters to you most when shopping for jeans?”



This is a way to ask about the user’s pain points of the problem they’re looking to solve. I’m sure you can see the value in knowing that. Once known, there are several ways in which you can apply this data. For example, you could show social proof that highlights the specific pain point/feature/benefit chosen by the user. As a PPC and email marketing agency we utilize this across email campaigns, retargeting ads, and much more. 



Quantity Owned



What quantity would give you the most purchase intent indication? “How many pairs of jeans do you own?”



If someone buys a lot of something or participates a lot in an activity, then this can show us the potential for someone to convert. 



If you’ve bought a lot of jeans before, you’re likely to buy more. Also means you’re a potential repeat customer.



Ready to Buy?



Do you know in what stage of the funnel each user is? “When are you looking to buy your next pair of jeans? Today? In a few weeks? In a few months?”



This simply tells us who’s “hot” and “cold”. Someone selecting Today is likely to be more valuable than someone selected In a Few Months.



Of course, you can have more questions that are relevant to your business, but these can be seen as foundational questions that can help you enrich user profiles that have specific purposes and can be used for a number of initiatives.



In terms of data storage, we mainly use Klaviyo. All of these answers pass over to Klaviyo and the result is enriched subscriber profiles with multiple data points for each. 





2. Analyze the Data to Uncover Revenue-Based Patterns



Now we’ll talk about what to do once you have data collected. While this wasn’t mentioned before, it is critical that you are able to pass any UTM parameters into Klaviyo for each user that answers the questions. This way, for each profile you’ll have the answers from the questions and source/medium plus any other UTM parameters you are using (we strongly recommend campaign, ad set, and ad names – or IDs if you’re comfortable syncing them up with the actual names via a VLOOKUP). I repeat, this is critical for the analysis, so make sure this is possible when setting up the offer experience. 



Ok, let’s continue. In Klaviyo, you export the subscriber data broken down by each question, historical lifetime value, source/medium, campaign, ad set, and ad (based on the UTM system you use).



Once on a spreadsheet, you can create a pivot chart to show each question and the responses visually quantified (we like bar charts), with the ranking metric being Revenue and Selections. So, basically, 2 bar charts per question, one showing revenue by the answer and the other one showing selections by the answer. You should have 8 bar charts if your offer experience contains 4 questions. This alone should already give you some insights into what is happening. And, remember, this data is coming directly from users who are buying your products, so it’s very valuable.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0526_ZPDReverse_Infographic2_1080x1080.png"" alt=""Data visualization as a means to see where the best opportunity is for targeting for highly optimized ROI. "" class=""wp-image-23023"">



You can also concatenate (Excel formula used to combine elements from various cells into a single cell) all answers into a single cell, then create a pivot chart from that to show (for both Revenue and Selections) the best combination of answers possible. Because of the sheer amount of combinations, a lot of data may appear in this chart. Your attention should be focused on the top combinations of answers that are having the most impact on revenue. Visually speaking, this is very easy to point out.



You now know a lot. You know what users are selecting, and you know which selections are bringing the most revenue. Even better, you know which exact combinations of answers are bringing in the most revenue, which is basically creating a definition of the ideal customer for you – all based on data coming directly from customers.



But that’s not the best part. This is the best part: because of the UTM parameters, all of this data can be broken down by individual campaigns, ad sets, or even specific ads. This means you can clearly see where your most valuable subscribers are coming from down to the single ad, which in turn gives you very clear indications of what optimizations must occur. But this doesn’t just apply to ads, it also applies to landing page content, or website content, overall branding messaging, plus more.



This data has the power to essentially unlock an entire marketing strategy without having to make any guesses or assumptions on things like personas. It’s all based on hard data coming from the best possible segment: your customers.



3. Impact and Drive Optimization Decisions Across the Buying Journey



While I said the true value of this analysis is on the acquisition optimization front (and that has not changed), it is still worth it to point out some very clear initiatives you can work on on the personalization side of things. For example, in Klaviyo, you can create personalized email flows based on responses. But, instead of creating several unique flows based on the sheer number of permutations (which would be a ton of work, frankly… and most startup e-commerce businesses likely won’t have the capacity or resources to pull off that level of content creation efficiently), you can use two very useful features in the Klaviyo email builder. 



Show/Hide Content Blocks Based on Dynamic Variables



This allows you to either show or hide a piece of content based on a data point belonging to the profile that is receiving the email. For example, let’s say a subscriber selected Slim Fit as the response to the Interest question (“What style are you interested in?”). This means Slim Fit, as a data point, is attached to this subscriber profile. So imagine we have a content block in the email for each possible response to this question. By using this feature, we can tell Kalviyo to only include the content that makes sense based on the response. This eliminates the need to have unique email flows based on the same response, for example. You can learn more about this here.



Variable Syntax & If-Else Blocks



This is similar to the concept of the one above, but it’s really intended to just be about copy. It’s quite simple. We can create copy blocks and make them conditional, where certain copy will only show based on variables attached to the profile receiving the email. So, for example, using the same example as above, if they selected Slim Fit, then the email would only show copy related to that selection. You can read more about how to set this up here.



You can use these features to quickly (relatively quickly) add personalization to your emails and achieve a higher perceived level of quality from your brand. While this still requires content creation and is by no means an easy thing to accomplish, it is still more doable than creating unique content for every single permutation which is the path some companies decide to take, only to later realize the amount of effort needed does not meet the level of impact. Personalization is always great, and it can have an impact on your customers’ experience, but it likely won’t change your entire business in terms of significant incremental revenue or crazy conversion rate spikes. This is why using ZPD for just personalization is a high effort, low-or-medium yield activity. But when you also use ZPD to impact your acquisition efforts, you’re definitely getting more juice out of your orange!



Going back to acquisition efforts, specifically paid efforts, here’s a list of things that can be optimized based on collected ZPD:



Individual Ads 



Let’s say you complete the analysis laid out above and notice that an ad within a specific campaign is generating subscribers that, when broken down and analyzed, show that the best combination in terms of revenue is Slim Fit (interest) and Material Quality (benefit/pain point). 



If we know this to be true, then it’s pretty clear what our next creative test should be inside that exact campaign, with that exact audience. We should try an ad showcasing a model wearing Slim Fit jeans with some type of callout about the quality of materials. Or, instead of just testing a new ad, how about testing several ones where the different element is the callout about the quality of the materials. Even though you know this is what they care about, there may be an opportunity to get a deeper layer of knowledge here. And because you have ZPD tied directly to this one ad, you know you will have a very relevant test for this audience.



Landing Page 



Similar to the indication of what the creative in ads should focus on, we can apply the same logical thinking framework to landing pages. If we know that an ad that’s driving to a specific landing page is producing some top-ranking combinations in terms of revenue, then we test new versions of the landing page with the relevant content. 



So, using the same example above, something to test might be adding a content block that is just about the quality of the materials to the page, or maybe adding some reviews or testimonials that directly speak to that. Maybe it’s making the FAQ section have more questions about the quality of materials. 



Homepage 



Let’s stick with the same example. The top chosen style is Slim Fit. It may be worth it to make your hero banner be about Slim Fit options. Or maybe showcase it more throughout the homepage.



Product Page 



This is where the benefit/pain points question really shines. If you know your ideal or most valuable customer cares about the quality of the materials the most, then you know what information you need to go deep on in your product pages. This is why I love this approach. It tells you exactly what you need to focus on.



Of course, it may not be realistic for you to optimize all of these at once. As a matter of fact, you probably shouldn’t. You should read the data available to you properly and make decisions about where the gaps are and then optimize that.



For example, if you have a high CTR on your ad, a high view count of your offer, but a low sign-up rate, then that tells you that you need to optimize your actual offer or how the experience is set up or presented, or maybe the language in the copy being used. A different scenario: high CTR, low view count, high sign-up rate. 



This likely means you need to optimize your landing page. The ad is doing its job because it’s getting people interested enough to click through, and the sign-up rate is high which means people are finding your offer desirable, but the view count of the offer is low, which means people aren’t traversing or consuming your landing page properly in order to even trigger the offer. Maybe test changing your headline, or the hero visual, etc.



The goal is to identify gaps and optimize them with the learnings from ZPD. And because the data is tied to individual campaigns, ad sets, and ads, you can increase the effectiveness of your optimization for each campaign, each ad, each landing page, etc. 



It’s Not Bulletproof…



As much as I’d like to say this is groundbreaking, it’s simply not. Will it help you level up your analysis and thinking around ZPD? Absolutely. However, it does have its flaws.



The analysis does not happen in real time. It requires manual export, manual analysis in spreadsheets, and realistically cannot be done very often due to the amount of time it requires.



Using BI tools to essentially automate this process is certainly a better path to take. 



A relatively new tool we’ve found that essentially does the above is Formtoro. You can also use platforms like OctaneAI to create the offer experience and easily pass the data over to Klaviyo. Something that could also be helpful in enriching subscribers’ profiles is post-purchase surveys, which can be effortlessly done with a platform like KnoCommerce.



Conclusion



Mostly every business that collects ZPD is using it for personalization. That’s great. There’s nothing negative about that. You should probably find a way to do the same. But you should also use ZPD to boost efficiency in your acquisition efforts, especially around paid media, which makes it valuable and worth collecting. With some basic analysis, you can find which campaigns, audiences, ads, landing pages, etc are generating the best subscribers, which very clearly tells you what your overall marketing strategy should be. 



Stop relying on assumptions and put yourself and your business in a position where important decisions are made based on high-quality data. The results will speak for themselves.

Startup Marketing Agency FAQs






What is startup marketing?

Startup marketing focuses on leveraging limited resources to achieve growth and visibility through strategies that prioritize speed, measurability, and an understanding of the customer and product-market fit.



These specific strategies and services are tailored to where a startup is in their GTM journey, and can include: product-market fit validation, SEO, AEO, performance advertising optimized for low CAC, and lead nurturing to maximize customer lifetime value (CLV).







Should a startup use a marketing agency?

It’s a good idea for a startup to use a marketing agency so that they make sure you are visible in the right places, at the right time, to the right people. For startups, it’s even more important to ensure every marketing dollar generates a quantifiable ROI that is directly linked to scalable growth metrics.



By using a marketing agency, you ensure that your product is positioned correctly in the market, consistently presented with a credible and optimized message, and constantly validated by real-world data.







How do I choose the right startup marketing agency?

To choose the right startup marketing agency, first, you have to define your specific goals based on your startup’s stage; whether you need to prove your market idea or scale your user growth, and set targets tied to clear business results. You should also consider if you want to pick an agency that specializes in your industry, like SaaS or eCommerce.



Something else to think of is if you want an agency that uses AI to automate their operations. Finally, you should ensure the agency will be transparent and communicative by requesting live dashboards, weekly strategy calls, and reporting that strictly focuses on metrics like CAC and LTV.







What are AI marketing tools and why are they important for startups?

AI marketing tools are software platforms that use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), to automate marketing tasks, analyze data, and optimize campaign performance.



For startups, these tools are great because they help save time, reduce costs, and operate more efficiently by automating repetitive tasks like content generation, data entry, and ad management. This allows small teams to focus on tasks that truly require human intervention, like developing brand strategy, forming partnerships, creative, and more.



AI marketing tools essentially provide the efficiency and insight of a large marketing department, which is necessary for achieving the scalable growth demanded of a startup.

                                            What is eCommerce marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        eCommerce marketing is the process of building and selling consumer products and services through an eCommerce store. eCommerce marketing companies aim to guide potential customers through a memorable online shopping experience with digital marketing campaigns and marketing channels.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is an eCommerce agency important?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Today, it’s not enough to just have an online store or website for potential customers to purchase from. High levels of competition will render your online store a ghost town unless eCommerce marketing services are implemented. Finding, driving, and ultimately converting customers through eCommerce marketing strategies will give your online store an advantage.

                                        Increased competition, customer expectations, and customer behavior are just a few of the many challenges your business will face when doing eCommerce marketing. There are approximately 24 million eCommerce websites online today. Without a great product, audience targeting, and retention strategy, your business is in jeopardy of getting lost in the noise. It would help if you had an eCommerce digital marketing agency that moves fast, experiments, and allows your business to create a marketing machine.

                    You’ve got the questions, we’ve got the answers

                
                
                
                    

                                                
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What makes B2B SaaS marketing unique?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Software is a fast-paced product that is ever-evolving. Unlike other marketing strategies, marketing for B2B SaaS companies requires a different framework and model. Marketing campaigns and channels need to be implemented based on customer journeys and product-driven growth.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What are the key channels for B2B SaaS marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        B2B SaaS marketing is focused on promoting subscription-based software products, which requires reaching your target audience at the right place and time. Combining your efforts across organic, PPC, paid social, and email is the best step forward, but this is certainly not set in stone as software products change.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What is NoGood’s expertise in B2B SaaS marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        NoGood is one of the top B2B SaaS marketing agencies in the world and has worked with both early-stage and established SaaS businesses.

                                            Why is B2B SaaS marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        This space was once considered a niche sector but has become saturated over the last decade. Even non-technology companies present themselves as software companies to take advantage of a highly profitable industry. A good balance between product adaptation and marketing must exist to succeed in growing your SaaS through marketing. Partnering with a B2B SaaS marketing agency like NoGood will help your company differentiate its SaaS platform from the crowd.

                                            What is an AI marketing agency?                                         
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        AI marketing agencies use artificial intelligence and marketing automation to enhance traditional marketing practices. They differ from traditional digital marketing agencies by integrating advanced AI tools and algorithms to provide data-driven insights, automate processes, and create highly personalized marketing campaigns.
An AI marketing agency can also refer to a marketing agency that has experience and expertise in the AI industry and partners with companies to promote and sell AI products.  
At NoGood, we’re both. We’re a marketing partner to AI brands and incorporate advanced AI technology and methodologies into our marketing services.

                                        AI marketing requires a mastery of AI capability with an emphasis on data-driven insights, and highlighting personalization and adaptability while showcasing innovation and future potential. AI marketing agencies leverage artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency and efficacy of traditional marketing tactics. 
Unlike traditional marketing methods that rely on intuition or limited data, AI processes massive amounts of information to uncover patterns and trends. This allows for precise audience segmentation and predictive analytics, helping marketers anticipate customer needs and optimize campaigns effectively.
AI automates time-consuming repetitive tasks such as email marketing, social media management, ad targeting, and customer segmentation, increasing efficiency to allow marketers to focus on strategic and creative initiatives. 
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What are the best channels for AI marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        It’s different for every brand. We’ve observed recurring success with organic search, Google ads, LinkedIn ads, Meta ads, organic social, conversion rate optimization, and email.
Publishing in-depth articles, case studies, and white papers provides other channels, like paid and email, with the ammunition and learnings to create effective campaigns that target every stage of the customer journey.


It doesn’t always start with organic; paid efforts can jumpstart learnings for other channels, too. With rapid experimentation, we can uncover key learnings and meet your ideal user where they are in their journey. Applying these learnings to other channels creates up-front efficiency and effectiveness for your marketing campaigns.

                    Overview

                				 
                
                    
                        Founded by celebrity hairstylist Jonathan Van Ness of the Netflix show Queer Eye, JVN is a haircare brand that transcends the typical celebrity-backed product line.
It’s a brand grown from the ground up – literally. The patented hemisqualane used in its formulations is derived from sustainable sugarcane grown and harvested for JVN. As a silicone replacement, the proprietary hemisqualane boosts softness, slip and shine without compromising hair health. Other natural ingredients, like cassia bark and moringa oil, aid in styling and boast impressive clinical claims.
The “Come As You Are” tagline is reinforced by its affordable price point. It’s accessible and affordable salon-quality haircare that’s impressive down to the molecular level.
Van Ness’s platform promotes inclusivity, positivity, and self-care. JVN is the physical embodiment of that ethos by shifting the industry towards empowering messaging paired with impeccable product quality.
                    

                				
				 
            
        
    








    
        
            
                

    
            
    
            


            
        
    








    
        
            

                
                    The Challenge 

                				 
                
                    
                        To educate, entertain, and connect with JVN’s target audience to grow brand authority, build a loyal community, and drive sales.
The first few months of a brand launch are crucial for building authority and credibility, especially in the saturated beauty & haircare space. We set out to apply a performance branding methodology to assist in JVN’s official launch, lay the grounds for sustainable growth, as well as develop the brand’s ethos and voice as a standalone brand outside of Jonathan Van Ness. Despite the challenge of growing in a highly saturated beauty vertical, we designed our strategies with the goal to acquire significant market share and position the brand as a dominant player.
We executed multiple creative and growth experiments to identify the channel mix and conversion journey that best resonate with the audience.
We set an ambitious timeline to plan, execute, and launch a go-to-market strategy for the brand within 1 month. In addition to launching the brand, we also aimed to develop, organize, and execute  pivot product launch strategies for 3 new SKUs based on prior learnings, and to grow JVN’s following on TikTok at a cost-efficient rate.
From a sales perspective, the key objective was to identify and leverage key digital channels to drive traffic and revenue with profitable ROI. This involved a need to identify conversion rate optimization opportunities for increased conversions, and to implement various experiments within new & existing advertising channels to drive growth. We also set to launch and manage advertising campaigns to support B2B channels such as Sephora in both the US and Canada in an effort to increase brand awareness and cross-channel sales, as well as penetrate the Canadian market once shipping to the region became available.

                            NoGood’s strategy aided in the parent company’s largest product launch ever.

                        
                        
                            
                                In August 2021, the NoGood squad worked with the JVN team to launch the brand, using rapid experimentation across multiple channels to identify the optimal platform mix for sustainable and scalable growth.
We developed a performance branding matrix to experiment with a variety of value propositions and creatives, leveraging data-driven insights to pinpoint the exact combination of messaging and creative that resonated most with the audience and drove the highest conversions.
As a result, JVN surpassed industry-standard benchmarks in its first 90 days of operation — and it didn’t stop there. JVN continued to experience growth in Q1 of 2022 vs Q4 2021, exceeding the highest shopping period of the year, showing impressive growth of the brand. The nearly +300% increase in revenue and +140% increase in ROAS are strong indicators of how a holistic strategy can create long-term growth.
NoGood’s strategy aided in the parent company’s (Amyris) largest product launch ever in terms of units sold of its Complete Conditioning Mist, beating out more established portfolio brands by nearly double. The detailed launch plan built up anticipation by driving customers to SMS signup pages and created highly targeted, funnel-specific creative.

                                        The financial services technology sector has grown exponentially over the last decade and has become increasingly competitive. Creating successful data-driven strategies focused on reliability, trust, and credibility can often help Fintech brands differentiate themselves.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why should brands choose NoGood as their full-service Fintech digital marketing agency?

                                            Why is Fintech marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Compliance and regulatory policies already make it complicated to market in the financial space. However, an even more significant challenge is the lack of consumer trust. To overcome these challenges, you need a Fintech marketing agency like NoGood that understands how to use marketing channels to build customer relationships and transparent communication.

We help brands participate in culture authentically while creating shareable moments that ripple across platforms.

                    You’ve got the questions, we’ve got the answers

                
                
                
                    

                                                
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            How do NoGood’s conversion rate optimization strategies drive success?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        As a conversion rate optimization agency, we look at the user conversion journey holistically. It’s not enough to simply have a strong advertising strategy. It’s also about the destination of the ad traffic and a frictionless transition. Building brand awareness and driving website traffic is pointless if your website has a low conversion rate. We have a proven track record of implementing conversion rate optimization strategies that identify the smoothest conversion journeys for companies’ audiences so they can stop leaving money on the table.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            How do you measure CRO updates?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        At NoGood, we place a lot of value on true metrics and steer away from vanity metrics to measure results. Though every website and brand has its own business goals, most will use the following metrics to measure CRO success: conversion rate increase, purchases, purchase value, average order value, email sign-ups, or app installations.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What are the advantages of using conversion rate optimization services?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Data-informed decisions are at the heart of a conversion rate optimization strategy. Working with a conversion rate optimization agency will lead to an increase in conversion rates and sales, a decrease in website abandonment rates, and a more seamless website experience for relevant customers.

                                Most agencies treat performance and branding as separate disciplines or departments; we bridge the gap between both. Our design studio understands that successful creatives are rooted in data, which is why we combine purpose-driven creative and performance-driven strategies to enhance brand recall and drive growth. We believe that the perfect solution lies in the intersection between the extremes — and we have the results to prove it.

This all-in-one TikTok advertising guide is for brands to get started and see results, plus some best-in-class brand examples.



TikTok continues to be the go-to platform for brands seeking bold, creative (and increasingly high-performing) social and video advertising strategies. By Q3 2025, TikTok’s advertising ecosystem has evolved dramatically, with smarter targeting, fresh formats, and more seamless integration with eCommerce and creator-led marketing.



If your brand hasn’t revisited TikTok Ads since 2022, now’s the time.



This guide brings that refreshed lens, melding proven evergreen strategies with today’s innovations and cost benchmarks. Whether you’re aiming to build brand awareness, drive conversions, or spark views, this guide has everything from setting up Ads Manager to capturing viral momentum.



How Much Does It Cost to Advertise on TikTok? 



Advertising on TikTok in Q3 2025 remains highly accessible, but pricing can vary widely based on format, targeting, and campaign goals.



Typical TikTok Ad Cost Ranges (2025 Benchmarks)



Costs can vary widely depending on whether you’re promoting an app, a physical product, or a service, as well as on campaign goals and targeting.



1. CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)




Generally ranges from $10 to $20 for broad brand awareness campaigns.



For app install campaigns, CPMs may be on the higher side due to competitive app categories and mobile-focused audiences.



For product campaigns targeting niche audiences, CPMs might be slightly lower but vary depending on targeting precision and ad creative quality.




2. CPC (Cost Per Click)




Typically between $0.10 to $0.50.



For apps, CPCs tend to be on the higher end since clicks often lead directly to app installs or registrations, which have clear value.



For physical products or e-commerce, CPC can vary based on the product category, but well-optimized campaigns can often stay near the lower end.




3. CPI (Cost Per Install)




CPI (Cost Per Install) for app campaigns can range from $1.00 to $4.00+ depending on the app category, region, and competition.



For well-optimized app campaigns in less competitive niches or regions, CPI might be as low as $0.50.




4. CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)




CPA (Cost Per Acquisition) for product sales or leads typically ranges from $10 to $50, again depending on price point, niche, and funnel complexity.



Campaigns focused on higher-value products or subscriptions may see higher CPA but justify it with higher customer lifetime value (LTV).

Factors influencing costs include:




Ad Format: In-Feed, Spark, Branded Effects, and Live Shopping are the available types of ad formats on TikTok.



Targeting Level: Broad demographic targeting tends to be cheaper, while hyper-targeting (e.g., regional plus interests) can drive up costs and CPMs.



Placement Choices: Opting into placements like TikTok Shop can add value; and cost.



Auction Dynamics: Peak periods like late Q3 promotions (think back-to-school, pre-Q4) can see bidding competition and CPM inflation.




Tips to Optimize TikTok Ad Spend




Test one variable at a time (e.g., creative only, or targeting only) to isolate what drives results.



Take advantage of TikTok’s seasonal trends tool to align ads with momentum while managing cost per view.



Start with a moderate budget and scale high-performing ads via “performance plus” auto-bidding.




Is TikTok Good for Advertising? 



Absolutely! TikTok remains one of the most potent platforms for engagement and growth. Here’s why TikTok advertising is a great marketing tool:




Audience Reach & Engagement: With over 2 billion users globally and an engagement rate that outperforms Instagram and YouTube in short-form formats, TikTok is uniquely positioned to boost both brand visibility and participation.



Content-First Environment: TikTok’s culture rewards authenticity. Brands that lean into native storytelling (especially using creators and UGC) outperform polished, ad-style content in both CTR and share rate.



Platform Advancements: TikTok has continued to expand its brand solutions, adding AI optimization, enhanced analytics dashboards, AR filters, and smoother Shop integrations.



Versatile Objectives: Whether it’s driving app installs, building awareness, or prompting lead actions, TikTok offers objective-based campaigns that align with each brand funnel stage.




Q3 2025 Enhancement Highlights:




TikTok Creative Center now offers performance benchmark insights by vertical and format, helping advertisers make data-guided creative tweaks.



Shop Ads and Live Shopping broaden commerce paths; especially valuable for DTC and fashion brands.



TikTok’s ad placements now include improved CTA overlay options and shoppable AR filters, bringing content and purchase actions closer than ever.




In short, for any brand willing to lean into creative trends and paired with smart targeting, TikTok delivers.



How Do I Get 1,000 Views on TikTok Fast?



Getting 1,000 views may sound trivial; but in the TikTok ecosystem, how you get there matters. Here’s how to do it fast and smart in Q3 2025.




Leverage Trending Sounds & Hashtags: Jump into trending tracks or audio, pairing them with your brand’s message. TikTok’s algorithm favors videos that engage early, so being on trend helps.



Use Spark Ads: Instead of traditional In-Feed ads, Spark lets you promote your own (or user-generated) organic content as an ad. This increases authenticity and early engagement.



Use UGC or Creator Content: Collaborate with micro-influencers (10k-100k followers) for cost-effective, targeted reach. Creators bring trust; combining that with targeted ads amplifies impact.



Add a Strong Hook in the First Three Seconds: Quick questions, surprising visuals, or tension-based opening lines work best. TikTok users decide fast.



Use TikTok’s CTA Buttons, Effects & Stickers: If you want that visibility, make your content interactive. Polls, stickers, or animated elements grab attention.



Post at Optimal Times: Monitor your specific audience analytics. Typically, posting during late-afternoon or early-evening in your local time zone sees higher initial velocity.

Combining these tactics typically gets you not just 1,000 views, but overall higher engagement and audience retention. It is also important to be consistent with posting; the more you post, the more the chance of viral traffic. 



How Do You Do Advertising on TikTok? 



Setting up TikTok Ads effectively remains a straightforward (but strategic) path.



Step 1: Create a Business Center Account



Sign up at TikTok Business Center and register your brand or client account. Set up your admin team, link pixels, and connect any Shop integrations.



Step 2: Access TikTok Ads Manager



Familiarize yourself with the TikTok Ads Manager and the structure of TikTok ad campaigns. This structure includes:




Campaign: Objective (e.g., Awareness, Traffic, App Install, or Conversions).



Ad Group: Budget, schedule, targeting, and placement.



Creative: Format, assets, CTAs, and landing page(s).




Step 3: Set Your Objective & Bidding Strategy



Choose from Awareness, Traffic, App Installs, or Conversions. TikTok’s auto-bid tools (e.g., “Lowest Cost with Cap” or “Contract Bidding”) can help manage the pacing of your ad campaigns so that you don’t over or under-spend.



Step 4: Select Ad Formats



TikTok has several ad formats, all of which appear in slightly different places and could be used to achieve different campaign goals:



In-Feed TikTok Ads



In-Feed Ads are native video ads that appear directly in users’ “For You” feeds, seamlessly blending with organic content. These ads can be up to 60 seconds long and are skippable, giving users control over what they watch.



Because brands create original content specifically for these ads, In-Feed Ads offer full creative control and are ideal for direct response objectives such as driving app installs, website visits, or product sales. Their native placement helps them feel less intrusive and more engaging compared to traditional ads.



TikTok Spark Ads



Spark Ads allow brands to amplify existing organic TikTok videos, either from their own account or by way of the creators that they partner with (with permission, of course). Unlike In-Feed Ads, Spark Ads boost real, authentic content that already has engagement like likes, comments, and shares.



This format is especially effective for leveraging influencer content or viral user-generated videos to build trust and credibility, making the ad feel more native and less commercial. Spark Ads are a great choice when you want to capitalize on existing momentum without producing new videos.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1090"" height=""550"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NG_0905_TikTokAds_Image3-1.png"" alt=""Graphic showing how TikTok's Spark Ads work."" class=""wp-image-46299"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NG_0905_TikTokAds_Image3-1.png 1090w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NG_0905_TikTokAds_Image3-1-1080x545.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NG_0905_TikTokAds_Image3-1-700x353.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NG_0905_TikTokAds_Image3-1-540x272.png 540w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px"">



TikTok Branded Takeovers



Branded Takeovers are high-impact, full-screen ads that appear immediately when a user opens TikTok, capturing their attention instantly. These can be videos, GIFs, or static images and usually include links to landing pages or hashtag challenges. This format is excellent for rapid brand awareness or product launches due to its unavoidable placement.



TikTok Effect Ads



Effect Ads involve custom branded AR filters, stickers, or special effects that users can apply to their videos, encouraging creativity and user interaction. Effect ads focus on brand engagement and creating viral buzz by fostering the ongoing creation of user-generated content.



TikTok Live Shopping, Shop Ads & AR Lenses



These are TikTok’s eCommerce-focused formats, designed to drive purchases directly through the app.




Live Shopping enables creators or brands to showcase products in real-time video streams with clickable links for instant buying.



Shop Ads are product-focused ads integrated with TikTok’s shopping features to promote sales efficiently.



AR Lenses are augmented reality filters that users can interact with, often featuring branded products or themes to enhance immersive engagement.




These formats are tailored to boost eCommerce, combining entertainment with seamless shopping experiences.



Step 5: Define Targeting & Creative



Once you have selected the ideal ad format for your campaign goals, it’s time to build your audience. Targeting includes demographics, interests, behavior, and custom audiences (e.g., pixel-based visitors).



Creative for TikTok ads should always be in the form of vertical video (1080×1920) with a strong hook, clean overlay text, and a persistent CTA.



Step 6: Optimize & Monitor



Once you’ve launched your TikTok ad campaign, it’s not quite the end of the story; like with most paid advertising, these campaigns require constant optimization and monitoring. Use TikTok’s built-in analytics to:




Track impressions, reach, CTR, video play rate, and conversion rate.



Conduct A/B tests on creative, copy, audience, and format.



Adjust your creative mix by using insights from TikTok Creative Center.




Step 7: Scale What Works




Scale budgets gradually, duplicating high-performing ad groups.



Experiment with dynamic spark assets and content rotation.



Retarget engaged users with sequential messaging or new angles.




New TikTok Advertising Features (August 2025) 



Since our original guide, TikTok has rolled out enhancements geared toward better performance, creativity, and eCommerce.

Live Shopping & Shop Ads Expansion
TikTok’s live shopping continues to mature in Q3 2025, offering real-time engagement and shoppable stream overlays. Shop Ads integration allows seamless in-video catalog browsing.



AI & Creative Optimization
Enhanced A/B testing and AI suggestions now help with copy, visuals, and trending template recommendations. The TikTok Creative Centre’s benchmarking data (including format-based performance) helps craft top-performing creative.



AR & Interactive Effects
Branded AR filters with shoppable overlays have become mainstream tools for engagement-first brands; especially in beauty, accessories, and gaming.



Cross-Channel Repurposing & UGC Amplification
Best-practice is now reusing TikTok ads as Reels, Shorts, or Pinterest videos, supercharging ROI on creative investment. Spark Ads facilitate UGC amplification.



Enhanced Analytics Dashboards
Advanced dashboards allow filterable metrics for audience segments, creative types, and engagement rates within and across campaigns.




Brand Examples



Here are some refreshed case studies, inspired by brands from the original guide (now with Q3 2025 context).




Duolingo: Leveraged Spark Ads to amplify user-generated reaction videos, achieving 2x the typical video completion rate and 30% higher CTR by tapping into humor and narrative storytelling.



Pepsi: Ran a back-to-school In-Feed with AR selfie filters showcasing Pepsi flavors; integrated with Shop Ads, generating a 15% increase in catalog sales.



e.l.f. Cosmetics: Led a Branded Hashtag Challenge tied to song lyrics trending in August of 2025, garnering 40 million views and a 25% rise in site traffic.



L’Oréal: Paired AR Lipstick Try-On effect with Spark Ads featuring real customer UGC. Achieved a 3x increase in engagement versus traditional ads.



ASOS: Targeted Gen-Z bundle deals via Live Shopping streams (partnered with micro-creators to showcase outfits) resulting in 2x conversion rate across events.



Mercedes-Benz: Used In-Feed video ad series to tell mini-stories of customer journeys with their EV models; paired with lead-generation forms, resulted in lower CPL and higher test-drive sign-ups.



Bumble: Deployed “day-in-the-life” creator content using Spark Ads, achieving 50% higher swipe-through than plain static ads.




Each demonstrates a creative tactic tied to a business result; great templates to reference for other brands.



The Path to Virality in 2025



Going viral on TikTok in 2025 is less about chance and more about strategic creativity:




Prioritize Authenticity Over Gloss: Polished videos still win, but only if they feel native. The algorithm favors content that resonates as “real.”



Partner with Creators, Not Influencers: Micro-creators bring niche authenticity and cost efficiency.



Jump on Micro Trends Fast: Use TikTok’s Trends and Discovery tabs for inspiration, and be ready to iterate content within hours.



Recycle Across Formats: Test the same ad across vertical formats on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, and Pinterest.



Layer Your Strategy: Use spark ads for reach, in-feed for storytelling, Shop Ads for commerce, and retarget through sequential messaging.



Leverage Analytics Continuously: Tweak underperforming metrics (e.g., drop-off points, CTR) within each ad group regularly.




Conclusion 



TikTok’s advertising landscape in Q3 2025 continues to offer exciting opportunities and impactful outcomes for brands; especially for those willing to think creatively and adapt to evolving formats like Live Shopping, AR filters, and eCommerce-ready Spark Ads.

                    You’ve got the questions,
we’ve got the answers

                
                
                
                    

                                                
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What is crypto marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Crypto marketing is the practice of promoting and generating demand for a unique cryptocurrency, NFT, or blockchain technology. Marketing crypto requires a greater understanding of the sector, technology, and audience. Marketing strategies such as content creation, SEO, PPC, etc., are all executed to create credibility in the community.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What makes crypto marketing different from traditional marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are still relatively new. Marketers, technologists, investors, and everyday users are still trying to understand its full utility and use, making advertising, promoting, and creating demand for this technology much more difficult.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is NoGood the best choice as your crypto marketing agency?

                                            Why is crypto marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Since blockchain technology and crypto are relatively new sectors, the biggest challenge in crypto marketing is that we don’t know with 100% certainty what works. In this case, you need a cutting edge crypto marketing agency that tests fast, keeps up with trends and is obsessed with the crypto space. NoGood has partnered with crypto companies and is already ahead of the curve in crypto marketing.

Search engines are ever-evolving, and with the release of AI and search summaries, future rankings and traffic have become a hot topic of discussion.

                                        Over 90% of web experiences start on search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. At NoGood, we know that people usually find your brand first through a search engine, so building a solid foundation in SEO and investing in it can lead to explosive growth. This initial interaction on a search engine also means exposure to a high-intent audience — these are people who specifically seek an answer, and it’s important that your brand provides an answer to their question.

                                        SEO has significantly evolved over the years. Traditional methods of keyword stuffing and blackhat SEO won’t work in the long term.

                                            What is Healthcare marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Healthcare digital marketing is a strategic approach to marketing for hospitals and healthcare services, with the goal of reaching new patients and improving the overall healthcare experience. Healthcare marketing agencies enhance the patient experience and build stronger relationships through effective strategies like content development and SEO.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is marketing important in the Healthcare industry?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        For years, historical practices and old-school marketing tactics have limited the Healthcare industry. Digital marketing experts are helping many of these Healthcare clients better create, communicate, and deliver value. Implementing a digital marketing strategy will be essential for healthcare professionals to compete and stay relevant.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            What is NoGood’s experience in Healthcare marketing?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        NoGood has worked across multiple verticals in the Healthcare industry. We’ve taken Healthcare brands stuck in traditional marketing practices and ultimately transformed their business to 10-figure status through effective digital marketing strategies.
                                    
                                
                            

                                                    
                            
                                
                                    
                                        
                                            Why is Healthcare marketing challenging?                                        
                                    
                                
                                
                                    
                                        Much of the Healthcare industry still implements legacy systems and processes, making marketing for this sector quite inefficient. Even more challenging are the many restrictions that come with Healthcare marketing due to compliance issues such as HIPPA. A Healthcare marketing agency like NoGood has worked with some of the most prominent Healthcare organizations and understands the ins and outs of the space.

Marketing has been one of the most significantly impacted functions by the rapid adoption and advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). These powerful Generative AI tools are actively changing the way we approach various marketing tasks, from content creation and copywriting to strategic planning and campaign development. However, despite the growing interest and investment in LLMs, there has been a lack of comprehensive, unbiased studies evaluating their performance against real-world marketing use cases.



To address this gap, our team of experienced marketers conducted the first impartial study assessing the leading LLMs in the market. We recognized the need for a study that was not only conducted for marketers by marketers but also one that focused on the practical applications and challenges faced by marketing professionals in their daily work. 



Background



The global AI market has already been valued at $241.8 billion in 2023 as compared to $135 billion in 2022, and it is expected to surge to a staggering $740 billion by 2030, reflecting a CAGR of 17.3%, according to Statista. This surge is being spearheaded by the United States, boasting the world’s strongest AI research capabilities, followed closely by Europe. Enterprises are seeing a steep adoption rate. According to OpenAI, 90% of Fortune 500 brands are actively using their tools and API internally.

Generative AI Adoption in Marketing 



The marketing and advertising industry has emerged as a frontrunner in AI adoption, with a remarkable 37% of professionals already utilizing this technology in their daily tasks. 



This rapid embrace is not surprising, considering the unique blend of creativity and data analysis inherent to marketing. AI seamlessly integrates with this blend, offering powerful tools for both creative exploration and data-driven decision-making.

In a 2023 study conducted with marketers in the United States, 73% of respondents reported using generative artificial intelligence tools, such as chatbots, as a part of their company’s work. This widespread adoption indicates a growing comfort level and understanding of the potential benefits these tools offer.



Generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the way people work across industries, providing innovative solutions to complex tasks. It has found prominent usage in various job functions, notably in industries such as IT and Technology, Finance, Healthcare, and Marketing.



Marketing Evaluation to Leading LLMs Report 



The study involved a panel of 20 seasoned marketers, each with a minimum of 6 years of experience in the field. These experts were tasked with reviewing the output of anonymized leading LLMs across a range of the most common marketing use cases, including copywriting, marketing strategy development, content creation, creative ideation, and campaign planning. To ensure an unbiased evaluation, we carefully crafted prompts that were highly practical, realistic, and consistent across each model. This approach guaranteed that no single model was favored or engineered to outperform others, a common issue in LLM evaluations published by the creators of the models themselves.



The LLMs covered in the study:




LLama 2 by Meta



Gemini 1.5 by Google 



Perplexity by Perplexity 



ChatGPT (publicly available GPT 3.5) by OpenAI



Claude 2.1 by Anthropic 



Claude 3 – Sonnet by Anthropic 




By conducting this study, we aim to provide marketers with valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each LLM, empowering them to make informed decisions when incorporating these tools into their marketing strategies and workflows. Our findings shed light on the variability in performance across different aspects, such as creativity, thoroughness, and coherence, highlighting the importance of selecting the right LLM for specific marketing tasks. The data presented in this report demonstrates the significant potential of AI applicability use case in marketing as the industry continues to evolve.

                    Absolutely loved this report! It’s incredibly insightful to see a detailed comparison of leading LLMs in the marketing space. The breakdown of their strengths and weaknesses really helps in understanding which models are best suited for different needs. I especially appreciated the real-world use cases you included—it makes the data feel much more relevant. Looking forward to seeing more updates on this topic!

As of late 2024, 78% of businesses use AI in at least one function, and 71% of businesses use specifically generative AI. These statistics both mark significant increases in AI usage since 2023, and we can confidently predict that these numbers will continue to grow in 2025 and beyond. The most popular generative AI model, ChatGPT, has remained the most powerful player as a productivity, organizational, and informational tool for businesses across industries. But how exactly are we meant to be using ChatGPT for marketing? And, more importantly, how are we doing it with the highest possible level of efficiency?



How Is ChatGPT Used in Marketing?



ChatGPT is a powerful generative AI model that can perform hundreds of unique operations. Let’s review a few of them and how they could be useful for marketers:



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1.png"" alt=""Web graphic showing the eight most common uses of ChatGPT for marketing."" class=""wp-image-45823"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-700x700.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-540x540.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-160x160.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-320x320.png 320w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-64x64.png 64w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-128x128.png 128w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-1-250x250.png 250w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">




Analyzing Data: ChatGPT performs the intake, analysis, and sorting of massive amounts of data, whether it be an SEO keyword report or a large paid advertising dataset.



Generating Reports: Not only can ChatGPT analyze and sort large amounts of data, it also generates reports from said data, saving marketers the time (and the headache) of organizing data for marketing performance reporting.



Performing Research: From identifying reliable and legitimate sources to use in your writing, to giving you frameworks for demographic insights about your customer base.



Writing & Editing Content: When provided with a well-engineered prompt, ChatGPT can create a wide variety of marketing content, from video marketing content to blog posts, social media captions, content direction, email copy, and so much more. It can also edit said content for tone, voice, grammar, and spelling.



Writing Code: Need a piece of custom JavaScript or CSS for your website? Ask ChatGPT, and it’ll write it for you.



Operating as a Chatbot: OpenAI (the company behind ChatGPT) has an API that can be integrated into an app or website. This API can then be used to build out a custom chatbot that can serve as an important component of your marketing strategy.



Giving Recommendations & Insights: Give ChatGPT an appropriate amount of context, and it can act as your brainstorming partner for marketing mix modeling and optimizing paid advertising campaigns.



Generating Images: ChatGPT is integrated with a tool called DALL-E, a generative AI engine that is specifically designed for image generation.




Though ChatGPT is powerful, it’s not a perfect engine. I recommend that it be used by knowledgeable marketers as a “helping hand”, not as a replacement for a fully-operational marketing team.



Advantages & Disadvantages of ChatGPT for Marketing



If you’re a marketer reading this, don’t worry; ChatGPT isn’t taking your job today, tomorrow, or at any point in the near future. Marketing, at its core, is a human-focused discipline based heavily on consumer psychology. The way we see it, there will always be a human element required.



That being said, let’s look at some of the most prominent advantages and disadvantages of using ChatGPT (and generative AI in general) for marketing:



Advantages of AI & ChatGPT for Marketing




Availability & Speed: Generative AI tools don’t log off at 5pm. They’re operational 24/7, making them invaluable for things that are needed last-minute or on a tight timeline. Need a chart for a QBR that starts in 15 minutes? Turn to ChatGPT. It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be better than showing up empty-handed.



Efficient Data Analysis: As an SEO who has spent years poring over spreadsheets, I can personally attest that generative AI (particularly the Gemini integration in Google Sheets) is very helpful when it comes to manual tasks like data sorting and cleanup. It means I save time on keyword research and can spend more time working on the things that actually move the needle: writing high-quality, helpful content.



Scalability & Cost-Effectiveness: This one might sound a little scary, but it’s always been about efficiency. According to McKinsey, the implementation of AI in marketing functions has the potential to result in a 10% decrease in global function spending. To my fellow marketers reading this, it’s time to start embracing AI as an extension of your (assuredly brilliant) marketing brain.



Wide Range of Marketing Knowledge: As brilliant as your brain may be, ChatGPT and other generative AI models allow you to further extend your marketing knowledge quicker than ever before. You can talk to it at your level; no more dumbing down your asks to search for answers with traditional Google searches.




Disadvantages of AI & ChatGPT for Marketing




Shortage of In-Depth, Contextual & Industry Expertise: This is a great example of the human element of marketing. While ChatGPT is great at doing things fast, it doesn’t have the kind of understanding that comes from having years of industry experience. The content it writes can miss the mark in terms of context, trends, recent industry updates, and hyper-specialized language.



Absence of Emotional Intelligence: ChatGPT doesn’t feel emotions or have malleable neural pathways like we do, making it harder to capture things like empathy, irony, or nuanced humor that connects deeply with audiences. I actually asked ChatGPT to draft this section for me, and it didn’t even get offended. A human (or at least I) would have.



Dependency on Data Quality: The outputs that generative AI spits out are only as strong as the data they’re given. If data is outdated, incomplete, or biased, you better believe that the output will be, too. In this instance, human oversight is definitely still essential to ensure accuracy and relevance.



Information Bias & Security Risks: On a similar note to the data quality point, ChatGPT can (and will) reproduce any biases present in both your data and its own training data. Additionally, using generative AI sometimes involves sharing proprietary information, which introduces potential privacy and data security risks.



Lack of Human Creativity: ChatGPT is great at remixing existing ideas, but struggles to invent truly original concepts, especially when the goal is to be bold or unconventional. Human marketers (that’s us!) bring intuition, cultural awareness, and out-of-the-box thinking that AI can’t replicate.




Which AI Model Is Best for Marketing?



We’ve focused mainly on ChatGPT up to this point, but it’s a fact that not every generative AI model is created equally. Some models excel at certain marketing and marketing-adjacent functions, while others fall a little short. Here’s a diagram to give you an idea of which generative AI you should be using depending on your needs.

One word of caution: don’t take the above as the final say. The information provided is based on our own experimentation with generative AI.



There are other factors at play when deciding which model is right for you; things like your industry, the specific marketing function you operate in, how well-engineered your prompts are, and more.



Can ChatGPT Do Digital Marketing?



Alright—now you know the things that ChatGPT can do, its advantages and disadvantages, and what other generative AI models are available to you. It’s now time to drill down into specific marketing functions and go over all of the ways ChatGPT can help improve your efficiency and productivity. And for another added bit of reassurance, remember, the goal is not for AI to take your job, it’s for AI to help make you BETTER at your job.



Digital marketing is a broad space, and AI has a place in almost every discipline within it. In this post, I’ll be focusing on SEO (I’m no ChatGPT, but I guess I am a little biased after all), paid search, and social media marketing. If you’re looking for something specific to video marketing, we’ve got an article for you right here.



As a bonus, at the end I’ll also be giving away a few super duper helpful tips for marketing prompt engineering 😉



How to Use ChatGPT for SEO



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""844"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3.png"" alt=""Graphic showing the four uses of ChatGPT for SEO."" class=""wp-image-45828"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-700x547.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-540x422.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-160x125.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-3-320x250.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">



As an SEO myself, the four main ways I use ChatGPT for SEO are:




Analyzing SERPs with ChatGPT



Using ChatGPT for keyword research and clustering



Asking ChatGPT for technical SEO guidance



Writing optimized content with ChatGPT 




1. Analyzing SERPs With ChatGPT



When creating content to rank well in search engines, researching what’s already ranking and implementing a sort of “drafting” strategy is a common tactic that works.



To analyze a SERP with ChatGPT, you can either use one of the prompts provided below or leverage a ChatGPT model like SERP Analyser Pro. This is a model specifically trained for this function, eliminating the need to “mini-train” your own model.



The added benefit of this model is that it also takes into account newer disciplines of search optimization, like Answer Engine Optimization (or AEO; it’s also called GEO, LLMO, and AI Search. The SEO world clearly hasn’t landed on a name yet, but we are working on it, I promise).



Speaking of SERP analysis tools, and before we get into some example prompts, I also feel the need to give credit where credit is due: a non-ChatGPT-powered tool that I love to use for AI SERP analysis is Frase.io.



SERP Analysis Prompts for ChatGPT



Depending on your goal with SERP analysis, there are a few options for ChatGPT prompts you can use:




For SERP Content & Intent Analysis: “Analyze the top 10 Google results for [keyword]. Identify the dominant content types (blog, product page, video, etc.), the search intent (informational, navigational, transactional, commercial), and summarize what the top pages focus on.”



For Content Gap & Opportunity Identification: “Compare the common topics, angles, or subtopics covered in the top-ranking pages for [keyword] and tell me what’s missing that I could cover to stand out.”



For Featured Snippets & Rich Results: “Look at the SERP for [keyword] and describe any Featured Snippets, People Also Ask results, or other SERP features. Suggest how I might optimize to target these.”



For General Content Length & Format: “For the top-ranking pages on [keyword], tell me the common content formats and average content length.”




2. Using ChatGPT for Keyword Research & Clustering



Along with SERP analysis, keyword research, and clustering are foundational elements of SEO, but they’re very data-heavy. With ChatGPT, gone are the days of sifting through massive spreadsheets, parsing the data manually (as much as I loved doing it, I can admit that using ChatGPT has saved me a lot of time and headaches).



The way I use ChatGPT for keyword research is to uncover variations of keywords within clusters or topics that I’ve already identified. You’ll notice a trend where I like to start with human analysis and then use ChatGPT to refine my keyword strategy.



Keep this in mind: the goal of keyword research and clustering is to have a clear direction and justification for an intentional SEO strategy. However, be sure to also incorporate other SEO tools (shouting out Ahrefs for this one) that give you accurate information on search volume and keyword difficulty for your keywords.



Let’s look at a few ChatGPT prompts for keyword research and clustering.



Keyword Research & Clustering Prompts for ChatGPT



For Clustering Keywords by Topic or Intent:




“Take the below list of keywords and group them by search intent (informational, transactional, navigational, commercial)” and paste the list.



“Cluster the below keywords into topic clusters or content pillars for a blog strategy,” and paste the list.



“Group the below keywords by theme so that each group could be covered by a single comprehensive page or article,” and paste the list.




For Discovering Variations of Keywords:




“Generate a list of related keywords and long-tail variations for [main keyword] that people might search for.”



“What questions do people ask about [topic] that could be used as blog post titles or FAQ content?”



“Find semantically related terms and synonyms for [keyword] that could help expand topical coverage.”




Build Keyword Lists for Specific Audiences or Use Cases:




“Create separate keyword lists targeting beginners vs. advanced audiences interested in [topic].”



“Generate keywords that combine [main topic] with purchase-related modifiers like “best”,”buy”,”reviews”, and “pricing”.”




3. Asking ChatGPT for Technical SEO Guidance



I’ll be the first to admit that I am not a technical SEO expert or a web developer by trade. That being said, I’ve found ChatGPT to be an extremely helpful starting point in terms of general recommendations and best practices when it comes to improving a website’s technical SEO performance.



For the sake of continuing the trend of non-ChatGPT tool recommendations, I’ve decided that my winners for technical SEO are Screaming Frog and PageSpeed Insights.



Technical SEO Prompts for ChatGPT



Similar to SERP analysis, the prompts you can give ChatGPT for technical SEO will vary depending on your goal:




For Audit Data Interpretation: “Here’s a crawl report export from [crawl platform]. Can you help me interpret the data? Tell me what the most important issues are, group them by priority, and explain why they matter.”



For Site Content Structure: “Here’s a list of my site’s top pages by traffic and topic. Can you identify which could be pillar pages and suggest related cluster topics or supporting content?”



For Crawlability & Indexability: “Here’s a list of my website’s URLs and their current index status. Can you review and tell me which pages should be indexed and which might be better left out and why?”



For Fix Recommendations: “Here’s a PageSpeed Insights report. Can you summarize the main performance issues and list practical fixes we could try to correct?”



For Structured Data Insights: “Here’s a list of page types on my site (blog posts, landing pages, product pages, etc.). Can you recommend the most relevant structured data types for each?”




As you’ll notice, many of these prompts require you to have an export of your site’s pages, a technical SEO report, or a Core Web Vitals report on hand. Getting this report into a format that is readable by ChatGPT is still a manual process, but an incredibly manageable task given that ChatGPT is doing the heavy lifting.



4. Writing Optimized Content With ChatGPT



If it hasn’t been drilled into your head already like it has mine, ChatGPT is not very good at writing SEO-friendly content.



Google doesn’t outwardly punish AI-generated content, but it just so happens that this type of content often violates Google’s spam policies. AI-generated content tends to be low-quality and unhelpful (think back to how we talked about generative AI’s lack of industry context and human creativity). ChatGPT can regurgitate information, but it can’t come to original conclusions based on expertise, and has trouble writing engaging content that speaks directly to a specific target audience.



I hate to break tradition, but the only non-ChatGPT tool I can really recommend for the actual “content writing” part of content writing is your wonderful brain, plus the occasional “synonyms for [insert word here]” Google search.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1090"" height=""424"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4.png"" alt=""Google's AI Overview showing AI-generated results."" class=""wp-image-45825"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4.png 1090w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-1080x420.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-700x272.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-540x210.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-160x62.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-4-320x124.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px"">



That being said, there are still ways that I use it for content writing. Below are some prompts to get you started.



Content Writing Prompts for ChatGPT



The world of SEO content writing is a bit broader than the previous things we talked about. Bear with me for this mega-library of content prompts:



For Keyword-Driven Topic Creation:




“Generate 10 blog topic ideas targeting the keyword [keyword] that have an informational search intent.”



“Suggest related subtopics or long‑tail keywords for a pillar page about [topic].”




For Drafting (& I Emphasize DRAFTING) Content:




“Write an SEO-friendly blog intro for the topic [topic], targeting the keyword [keyword]. Please include credible sources and external links throughout.”

For the output of a prompt like this, I would use it as a synthesized research reference. Think “skim, learn, and create”, based on your new knowledge of the topic at hand.





“Create an outline of H1, H2, and H3 subheadings for a blog post targeting [keyword]. Cover all major questions users might have about [keyword topic].”



“Suggest relevant FAQs to add at the end of this post based on common user questions.” and paste the post content.



“Rewrite this paragraph to include the keyword [keyword] naturally and improve clarity.” and paste the paragraph.



“Write a featured snippet‑style answer (40–60 words) to the question: [question].”




For On-Page Metadata:




“Write me 3 options for an SEO‑friendly title tag (max 60 characters) and meta description (max 160 characters) for this post.” and paste the post content.




For E.E.A.T. & Authority-Building:




“Suggest ways to add author expertise or credibility signals to this article.” and paste the article content.



“Recommend trustworthy external sources or studies I could cite in this post.” and paste the post content.




The best way I can describe the main benefits of using ChatGPT for SEO is that it generates more content than you could ever need, most of it being what us writers would describe as “fluff”. This gives you the opportunity to sift through, find the nuggets of information that you do want to include, and add them to your human-written content in a way that sounds—well, human.



How To Use ChatGPT for PPC



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""844"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5.png"" alt=""Graphic showing the four uses of ChatGPT for PPC."" class=""wp-image-45824"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5-700x547.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5-540x422.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5-160x125.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-5-320x250.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"">



The most common ways for marketers to use ChatGPT for PPC include:




Brainstorming keywords (and negative keywords)



Drafting ad copy variations



Generating highly-targeted landing page copy



Analyzing campaign data and pulling insights




1. Brainstorming PPC Keywords With ChatGPT



Keyword research for paid ads tends to be done in a very similar way to keyword research for SEO. The main difference is having to align the selected keywords to a budget.



Presumably, if you’re developing a PPC campaign, your keyword research is centered around a persona, pain point, and solution. Use these in your prompts to specify and target the most optimal keywords for your campaign.



PPC Keyword Research Prompts for ChatGPT



For Uncovering PPC Keyword Opportunities: 




“Generate a list of transactional keywords related to [offering] that have strong purchase intent.”



“Suggest variations and synonyms for the keyword [main keyword] suitable for paid search campaigns.”



“List keywords combining [main keyword] with price, location, brand, and feature modifiers.”




For Organizing Keywords by Funnel Stage or Intent: 




“Group the below seed keywords by funnel stage (awareness, consideration, decision),” and paste the list.



“Identify which of the below keywords show high commercial intent vs. purely informational.” and paste the list.



“Create separate keyword lists for branded, competitor, and generic searches around [offering].”




For Negative Keyword Discovery: 




“Suggest negative keywords I should add to avoid irrelevant clicks for campaigns targeting [main keyword].”



“Review this list of keywords and flag terms that might attract low‑quality or unrelated traffic.” and paste the keyword list.




For Local or Niche PPC Keyword Targeting: 




“Suggest PPC keywords targeting [offering] in [location], including geo‑modifiers and “near me” terms.”



“List niche long‑tail keywords people might search for related to [feature or use case].”




2. Drafting PPC Ad Copy Variations With ChatGPT



For a task like creating ad copy variations, it’s important to remember that ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained bot and only has access to its training data. All that is to say, the more people use ChatGPT, the better its responses will become, but until it’s further developed, I recommend sticking to using it as an idea initiator rather than an idea generator.



To translate: similar to only drafting content for SEO using ChatGPT, use it as a way to brainstorm and ideate ad copy variations. Combine the ideas it gives you into an original one, or take one of the variations and inject some humor or brand voice into it. Don’t be a “copy and paste” warrior.



PPC Ad Copy Prompts for ChatGPT



For Generating Multiple Headlines or CTA Variations: 




“Write 10 Google Ads headlines (max 30 characters) and 10 descriptions (max 90 characters) promoting [offering] to [target audience].”



“Write 10 headline variations emphasizing [benefit] and 10 emphasizing [other benefit].”



“Create 10 PPC ad copy variations that focus on solving [pain point].”




For Variations in Audience Targeting: 




“Write 5 variations of [platform] ad copy targeting first‑time buyers of [product] and 5 copy variations targeting repeat customers.”



“Write 5 ad variations for people comparing options for [offering] and 5 variations for people who are ready to buy now.”



“Suggest 5 headlines addressing budget‑conscious buyers of [offering] and 5 headlines for premium buyers.”




For Adapting to Various PPC Platforms: 




“Rewrite this ad copy to fit Meta Ads’ primary text, headline, and description best practices.”



“Create a short LinkedIn ad (under 150 characters) targeting B2B buyers of [offering].”



“Write responsive search ad assets: 10 headlines and 5 descriptions for [topic].”




Notice how none of the above example prompts had anything to do with writing in a certain style (e.g., “write funny, playful ad copy”). You really expected me to recommend that? After everything we’ve been through together? I really thought we were getting somewhere ☹️



3. Writing PPC Landing Page Copy With ChatGPT



Most PPC campaigns require specified landing pages (or changes to be made to existing webpages to align with campaign needs). ChatGPT can help you DRAFT content for new landing pages or RECOMMEND edits for content on existing webpages.



PPC Landing Page Copy Prompts for ChatGPT



For Drafting & Optimizing Landing Page Copy: 




“Write 5 variations of a compelling hero headline and subheadline for a landing page promoting [offering] to [audience]. Focus on [benefit].”



“Draft body copy explaining why [target audience] should choose [offering], highlighting [top 3 benefits].”



“Create an FAQ section answering common objections about [offering].”



“Below is a portion of the current copy on my landing page for [topic]. Give me suggestions for how to align it better with PPC visitors who searched for [keyword].” and paste the text.



“Make the below copy more concise and action-focused, so it works better for paid traffic.” and paste the copy.



“Write me 5 CTAs with a focus on urgency for this section of my landing page about [topic].” and paste the text.



“Make this headline clearer and include the keyword [keyword] for relevance.”




For Audience & Intent Tailoring: 




“Write me 3 variations of [section] of landing page copy for [offering] targeting [audience] searching for [keyword].”

I like to use ChatGPT to draft content section-by-section; otherwise, it can get off track fairly quickly.





“Draft copy appealing to high-intent searchers looking for [benefit] [offering].”




4. Analyzing PPC Campaigns With ChatGPT



Though this can theoretically apply to SEO as well, I wanted to include some data analysis prompts in the PPC section since this data tends to be more concrete and dense. That being said, you always have the freedom to get creative! Most of the prompts thus far have been copy-and-paste-ready, but they can always be tailored to match your specific marketing needs.



As a general tip, I recommend pasting in your campaign data as the initial “mini-training” prompt to let ChatGPT know that you’re about to ask it a bunch of questions about the same dataset. I also recommend starting a new chat for things like this, to ensure that you’re working with a “clean slate”.



PPC Campaign Analysis Prompts for ChatGPT



For Overall Performance Analysis: 




“Summarize the key takeaways and trends from this data, as well as what might be causing them.”



“Based on this data, tell me what’s working well and what needs optimization.”




For Trend & Anomaly Detection: 




“Look at this data split and highlight which campaigns are performing best and worst based on CPA and RoAS.”



“Identify the ad groups with high spend but low conversions and suggest what might be happening.”



“Identify which keywords or audiences are driving most of the cost without delivering conversions.”



“Find unexpected spikes or drops in spend, CTR, or CPA and suggest possible reasons.”



“Identify seasonal or day-of-week patterns in performance from this data.”




The way I see it, the true power of ChatGPT for PPC is similar to SEO, with the added major benefit of parsing massive datasets and identifying trends that wouldn’t otherwise be visible to the human eye.



Humans typically operate on a singular causation basis (a change in X variable led to a change in Y variable), whereas ChatGPT can spot trends that are caused by three, four, or even five different variables and summarize the impact clearly.

Alright, stay with me here. This is our last channel-specific section before we get to those prompt engineering tips and tricks I promised you. I know you’re growing impatient 😉



Here’s how to use ChatGPT for social media marketing: 




Creating social content calendars



Repurposing existing content



Optimizing for social search




1. Creating Social Content Calendars With ChatGPT



I’ll repeat myself again (and spoiler, it won’t be the last time either): ChatGPT should be used to draft content ideas, not copy and paste, or set it and forget it, or any other shortcutting phrase you can think of.



Just like with PPC ads, I find that “mini-training” ChatGPT by providing it with an overview of the offering you’re marketing, the audiences you speak to, your content pillars, and any relevant seasonality or upcoming promotions is the best way to set you up for success.



Social Content Calendar Prompts for ChatGPT



For Creating Calendars & Cadences: 




“Create a 4‑week social media content calendar for [offering] targeting [audience], with 3 posts per week mixing [content pillars] types of content.”




For Aligning Content With Campaign Goals: 




“Create a content calendar supporting our upcoming [event or offering], including teaser posts and follow‑up posts.”



“Draft a weekly posting plan to [campaign goal] for [offering or promotion].”



“Brainstorm 10 content ideas for our brand’s social channels focusing on [campaign focus].”




For Frequency & Timing Insights: 




“Build a 3‑posts‑per‑week schedule for [platform], showing which days and times might be best to post.”



“Suggest an ideal daily posting schedule across [platform or platforms] for a B2C brand in [industry].”



“Based on what you see as the standard cadence for [industry], build a monthly [platform] cadence for [brand] that includes [post types or topics].”




2. Repurposing Existing Content With ChatGPT



When marketing teams work together efficiently, it’s common for social media to work hand-in-hand with SEO, writers, or video marketers to repurpose content across channels. ChatGPT can help with that!



Content Repurposing Prompts for ChatGPT



For Turning Blogs into Social Posts: 




“Turn the below blog post into 3 LinkedIn posts, each highlighting a different key takeaway.” and paste the blog post content.



“Summarize this blog into a Twitter thread with 5-7 concise tweets.” and paste the blog content.



“Create an Instagram carousel outline based on the main points of this article.” and paste the article.




For Creating Multiple Formats From One Source: 




“From the below blog post, generate: a poll question for LinkedIn, a Reel script, and an infographic outline.” and paste the blog post.



“Draft an Instagram caption, a question sticker for Instagram Stories, and a carousel idea based on the below content.” and paste the content.




For Highlighting Key Points or Stats: 




“Pull 5 attention‑grabbing stats or quotes from this content.” and paste the content.



“Create 3 discussion questions we could post on LinkedIn based on this article.” and paste the article.




3. Optimizing for Social Search



The rise of social search marks an era where people are using social media as a new kind of search engine. Algorithm and technology advancements have opened the door to things like blue comments on TikTok that answer user queries, eCommerce being increasingly integrated with social media, and the influencer marketing space continuing to develop.



Social media marketers are now tasked with becoming SEOs of their own, aligning content not only with business and campaign goals, but also with platform-specific algorithms. Social search introduces concepts like keyword research, discoverability, and a new set of best practices.



Social Search Optimization Prompts for ChatGPT



For Keyword Research & Content Drafting: 




“Suggest keywords and hashtags people might search for on TikTok when looking for content about [topic].”



“What are common search phrases users type on Instagram or TikTok to find videos about [topic]?”



“Rewrite the below Instagram caption to include [keyword] so it’s more discoverable in social search.” and paste the caption.



“Make the below video script include trending or niche hashtags and keywords for better search reach.” and paste the script.



“Suggest engaging TikTok video titles that include [keyword].”




For Discoverability: 




“Suggest 10 short video ideas based on what people commonly search for about [offering].”



“List FAQs people might type in social search around [topic].”



“Brainstorm questions that users might search on TikTok about [topic].”



“Suggest hashtags that combine broad reach with niche relevance for this Instagram post.” and provide the post and caption.




For Social Search Best Practices: 




“Explain how using keywords in on-screen text helps TikTok SEO.”



“Describe why repeating your keyword in captions and spoken audio matters for social search discoverability.”




Since social search is a newer discipline within marketing, it’s important to familiarize yourself with best practices around it before implementing it into your marketing strategy. ChatGPT can be a helpful research tool for this!



ChatGPT Prompt Engineering Tips: How to Use ChatGPT Effectively



If you made it this far, congratulations (and thank you for reading). If you skipped down to this part of the post, I have nothing to say to you except “at least you know what you’re looking for”. Let’s get into some of my favorite prompt engineering tips and tricks for using ChatGPT (for marketing and in general):



1. “Mini-Train” Your Model



I mentioned this throughout the article, but I’ll add it again here for those who really did just skip down to this part (no I’m not salty). To “mini-train” your model, you’ll need to start with a new chat; a clean slate, if you will.



Think of “mini-training” as a giant info dump of every piece of context that ChatGPT might need to be able to give you informed answers to your queries. This can be things like:




Brand voice guidelines (I’ll stress one last time that I only recommend using ChatGPT for drafting, but this would get you closer to the final brand voice)



Data from previous campaigns



Competitor research and analysis



Growth marketing strategy decks or other presentations with relevant information




I like to tell ChatGPT that I’m about to give it a ton of information, give it said information, and then ask it to confirm that it understands what I’ve given it. From there, your model should be “mini-trained”!



Tip Within a Tip: If you don’t have any of the above information to give ChatGPT, I find that simply asking it, “what can you tell me about [brand]?” typically also does the trick!



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1090"" height=""676"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7.png"" alt=""ChatGPT being fed context to be used for marketing."" class=""wp-image-45826"" srcset=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7.png 1090w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7-1080x670.png 1080w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7-700x434.png 700w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7-540x335.png 540w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7-160x99.png 160w, https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Image-7-320x198.png 320w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1090px) 100vw, 1090px"">



2. Set Up Restrictions & Requirements



On a similar note to “mini-training” your model, you can set and reinforce restrictions and requirements at any point in time. For example, if your brand’s name has changed from what it is in the documentation you’ve provided, you can tell ChatGPT, “Please refer to [old brand name] as [new brand name] from this point onward.” It’s not a perfect system, and ChatGPT might slip up here and there, but hey, that’s why you’re here, isn’t it?



Other examples of restrictions and requirements include:




Make it under 100 words



Don’t use the words “innovative” or “fast”



Walk me through your thought process step-by-step




3. Separate the Query From the Context



This is similar to “mini-training”, but not quite the same. You may have noticed this in the prompt examples provided above—many of them end in “and paste the content” or something to that effect.



I find that starting a request, pasting large amounts of content in the middle of it, and then finishing the request can result in parts of the query being lost in processing. If you need examples of this separation, scroll up to one of the example prompt sections above.



4. Create More Than You Need



There is typically not a noticeable difference in the processing speeds of ChatGPT, whether you ask it for five variations of something or 50. So, why not use that to your advantage?



If you only need three variations of a headline, try asking ChatGPT for 10 of them instead. Maybe number eight will spark something in your creative brain, and you wouldn’t have seen that variation had you asked for specifically the amount you needed.



5. Be Specific, but Don’t Contradict Yourself



The above example prompts are made to be highly customizable and expandable, but remember that ChatGPT is a machine—it interprets everything just as you said it.



If you’re planning on stacking prompts together or creating a megaprompt to use over and over again with slight variations depending on your needs, make sure that the prompt makes sense. That means no contradictions, straightforward requests, and no references to new information that the model doesn’t have yet.



For example, if you ask ChatGPT to analyze a dataset you haven’t provided yet, it’ll likely still give you a response, but with random data that came from who knows where. Not only that, you’ve now also confused your “mini-trained” model, and will likely have to start anew to prevent that “fake” data from making its way into your real data.



6. Ask Again, but in a Different Way



Still not getting the response you’re looking for? Think of a completely different way to ask the question or write the prompt.



Just because AI is more commonplace in the workplace doesn’t mean all critical thinking goes out the window. In fact, I’d argue that it’s more important than ever. You’re essentially critically thinking for two: yourself and ChatGPT.



This is, unfortunately, more of a case-by-case, “you’ll-feel-it-out-eventually” type of prompt engineering tip, but the takeaway is this: knowing what question to ask an AI system is an extremely valuable skill.



Is ChatGPT Replacing Digital Marketing?



If the content of this long-ass post and my periodic words of affirmation weren’t enough to convince you, I’ll give it to you straight: no, ChatGPT is not replacing digital marketing.



The thing that makes marketing work is the human element, the psychology of being, experiencing, and knowing. How are we meant to speak to human pain points, needs, desires, and emotions if we’re taking humanity out of it completely?



ChatGPT and ChatGPT-powered tools still contain flaws that require a human review and editing. All in all, ChatGPT is nowhere near the point where it can simulate the neural networks of a human brain. And with 8 billion unique human brains in the world—all with their own expertise, knowledge sets, cultural experiences, and personalities—we’re not going to get there anytime soon.



To (finally) wrap this up with a nice little bow, all of this is less about being replaced by AI and more about learning to work alongside it. Treat it like a peer: do the upfront 20% of work with data collection and formatting, let ChatGPT do the middle 60%, and swoop back in to apply your humor, industry knowledge, and uniqueness for the last 20%.



I won’t go as far as to say that ChatGPT is your friend, but I will admit that it can be a pretty helpful sidekick.

With relationship building taking the forefront of most marketing efforts and brands recognizing the long-term value of low-churn strategies, content marketing is quickly becoming the darling of growth marketing strategies. While previous iterations of the growth marketing stack focused heavily on a balance of multi-channel paid media with some organic sprinkled in for good measure, content is increasingly having its value recognized and leveraged at every stage of the marketing lifecycle to optimize for each stage of the loop. 



While certain types of content are better suited to solve for specific stages of the marketing journey there are opportunities for certain content, if leveraged properly, to satisfy the needs of people at every stage of the journey. An educational TikTok can simultaneously be the first touchpoint for someone who has newly discovered your brand and is early in their search, or the validation to push someone to purchase as the piece of information the video contains speaks directly to their pain points or even a shareable moment that inspires the customer to become an advocate by sending the video to a friend.



Ultimately the benefits of content marketing are many, but in the interest of keeping this under 10k words, here’s the TL;DR:




Lasting relationships



Cost-effectiveness



Data insights



Discoverability + intent



Building authority




Leveraging Content to Build Relationships: 



The relationship between brand and consumer is increasingly becoming more and more like a friendship or mentorship — one in which there’s a certain level of trust and meaningful connection that’s being made to establish a long-standing connection. 



The reasoning for this is fairly simple, in that the stronger the relationship with the audience, the more valuable that relationship becomes. If we were to look at two customer journeys as examples, we might see two different outcomes based on the relationship between brand and customer. 



In journey one, the customer has a specific need, they’re served an ad based on their previous behaviors to suit that need, they move to purchase, and if the product suits the needs they may or may not purchase again depending on how well it works, whether the product is competitively priced, or any other number of factors. 



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0906_BCM_Infographic1_1080x1080.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-24382"" style=""width:810px;height:810px"">


In journey two, a series of content pieces are created via UGC where the audience’s pain point is the focus. These content pieces span a landing page that the user discovers when searching for a solution to their problem, which leads them to a blog post that goes into deeper detail on how the product will help them, which encourages them to sign up for their email campaigns, which have a CTA to follow social their social media, where they regularly post content that’s relevant, informative, and engaging — and yes, there might be some ads out there too to catch the stragglers.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0906_BCM_Infographic2_1080x1080.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-24381"" style=""width:810px;height:810px"">


During the first journey, the interactions are purely transactional with the intent to purchase is the main focus of the process. During the second journey, however, the interactions are meaningful, engaging, informative, and otherwise valuable to the user which helps to build the relationship to develop loyalty and connection. The content is written in a specific voice in order to appeal to a specific audience, video content features specific content creators that are within the social spheres of the user, and other distinctions of color and preference are harnessed to strengthen the bond between brand and user. 



While yes, this second journey may have taken a bit longer than the first journey, it also positions the brand favorably in the post-purchase landscape. For the first journey, there were only a few factors driving loyalty for repeat purchase, or advocacy — whether the product worked, and how much the product cost. For the second, there are so many touch points that not only stick with the user through future content but encourage repeat purchases and advocacy by appealing to their various preferences — color, tone, voice, etc. 



Good content is like an old friend, one that you may not need or have around you all the time, but is there when you need it, and tends to know exactly the right time to present itself — and what’s better than old friends? 



Content Makes Dollars Go Further: 



It’s true that nothing is “cheap” or at least not lately, but the reality is that ad budgets need to be renewed with some frequency, and while you’re optimizing that ad spend, there is some of it that ultimately goes to waste. 



While content isn’t without its own associated costs, a strategically crafted piece of content going viral can afford an organization massive returns and will exist for days, months, or even years past publication — continuously driving traffic and conversions along the way.



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0906_BCM_Infographic3_1080x1080.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-24380"" style=""width:810px;height:810px"">


This is particularly true of blog and social content, as they live in perpetuity on our feeds and remain discoverable long past the post date, with blog content offering the opportunity to perform regular maintenance and updates to optimize based on observations and learnings. 



While written in 2019, our piece on the Peloton Marketing Strategy is still driving traffic and conversions to the NoGood site to this day while only requiring minor updates as the brand has pivoted and adjusted its strategy over the years. 



Data Insights + Cross Channel Learnings:



Depending on the channel, content marketing can happen quickly, or provide long-term learnings about your audience and community. These learnings can later be leveraged to help to optimize your ad spend or vice versa. 



There’s a common misconception that paid and social content are separate entities, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. In reality, they work closely together with the learnings from each platform informing the decisions on the other. 



Depending on the cadence of your paid Media campaigns, social media content can be run in multiple iterations to test nuances in design and messaging while the campaign runs its course. Once completed, the learnings from the paid Media campaign can be applied to the next wave of iterations of your social content, while the learnings from the rapid iterations of social content can inform new iterations for your paid campaigns. 



This process can be repeated as frequently as necessary, depending on your paid cycles, with new insights and optimizations becoming available with each cycle.



These insights are not limited just to social and paid Media either, as blog content, email campaigns, landing pages, and all other forms of content can provide insights into your audiences to help better understand them and of course, cater your messaging to them.



Discoverability + Intent:



With Google processing, billions of search query each day, and TikTok quickly making a name for itself as the search engine of choice for GenZ, discoverability and lead gen is one of the most valuable benefits to content – particularly when optimized for intent. 



This will be particularly beneficial as we move into a cookie-less future and targeting becomes less of an exact science for marketers and brands to continue building their strategies for single-party data.



Content allows brands to target specific demographics with a specific intent without cookies, or single-party data like an email, phone number, or social handle. 



Through the implementation of an omnichannel content strategy, brands can determine not only who their audiences are, but where they hang out, what their motivations are, and what the competition is doing. In doing so, brands are able to take control of their lead generation and shift to inbound and have audiences come to them through search intent – as opposed to relying on paid Media to find those who might be interested in your brand or project. 



<img decoding=""async"" width=""1080"" height=""1080"" src=""https://nogood.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NG_0906_BCM_Infographic4_1080x1080.png"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-24379"" style=""width:810px;height:810px"">


These strategies can target audiences across different channels and build in their own funnels through a content journey in order to not only engage communities but convert them to customers and advocates. 



Becoming an Authoritative Source:



As a brand, building your authority in a particular space, or on a particular subject or product, carries more benefit than just winning the trust of your audience – though that is admittedly a large portion of the value. 



Building authority as part of your Content strategy not only builds trust in new audiences but encourages them to share your content as well to inform others within their communities – organically activating audiences and turning them into advocates. 



Authority, however, has a more complex value-add as it relates to content as content structures can be engineered to serve as their own funnels – and drive additional traffic in the process.



While creating a singular piece of content that acts as a comprehensive resource that covers each and every angle on a specific topic to an exhaustive extent is often seen as the most direct route to building authority and gaining the favor of communities — though the reality is a bit more nuanced than that and sometimes less can be more. 



As a full-funnel approach, and to maximize the benefits of your content, the gigantic pillar pieces that act as comprehensive guides can also be broken out into digestible chunks to meet the audience where they are in their discovery journey. 



<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/__RiR7xR6My8HcQlYo_BFqR2JEuV2WQNBK26cE4uDef-BySawX8EOVIEP2sEFU1Vt922AotT0lrb011xNLVHEMb7b3x-8tlEQaX1Rj2HfZoTe4RPK2iBs6evDt7pVXvTzMy0xNPHNlF6HMwBS68S6BrVgb2qmh0EJakH-KXu6R_W-hgXT4VAkj0JYQ"" alt="""" style=""width:810px;height:810px"">


This will ensure that, no matter what the communities needs are, they are being met and served with a piece of content that has been built into your content strategy, and optimized to be found at just the right time, by just the right person, ensuring that your answer is always the right answer and that those who find it, associate your brand with being a comprehensive authority —  rather than one with a singular pillar of knowledge. 



Content That Keeps on Giving



As we continue to navigate the content economy and use content as currency, we need to keep a close eye on where we’re deriving the value from our content and how our audiences and communities benefit from what we’re putting out there. 



It’s a process that is ongoing and, as with all that we do, requires incremental adjustments based on observations and data in order to be properly optimized and ensure that it’s working.

Did you know that if you’re a podcaster, musical artist, SoundCloud-turned-Spotify-rapper, or even any old Spotify nerd, it’s possible to increase your visibility in Spotify? It’s called Spotify SEO, and, not to burst your bubble, but it’s a more common strategy than you think.



Social and AI search have already taken over. 67% of Gen Z uses Instagram (and 62% uses TikTok) to find information, not Google, and LLM usership continues to reach new heights (¼ of Millennials and ⅓ of Gen Z); and Spotify has a hand in both metaphorical pies (that’s a saying, right?)



The reality is, Spotify has always been a search engine of its own. But now that Spotify is directly integrated with ChatGPT (if you missed it, this happened in October of 2025), now is as good a time as any to learn the strategies that can push your music, your playlist, your artist profile, or your podcast into both in-platform user feeds and LLMs.



Is There SEO for Spotify?



Yes, Spotify SEO (and even Spotify AEO) are legitimate, and increasingly important, strategies. Just like optimizing for Google Search or AI search engines, you can optimize your Spotify content to boost visibility in search results. In short, Spotify SEO involves optimizing your profile, playlists, titles, descriptions, and metadata to help the Spotify algorithm better understand and distribute your content (whether it be to users or to LLMs).



Spotify uses sophisticated technology, including content-based filtering, collaborative filters, and natural language processing, to categorize content. This means strategic optimization of your artist profile, podcast show page, episode descriptions, and playlist creation can significantly impact your discoverability.



How Spotify’s Search Algorithm Works



There are four primary ways for content to be discovered on Spotify: search, playlists, Spotify’s featured recommendations, and being cited within AI responses. From an SEO and AEO perspective, these mirror keywords, backlinks, algorithm preferences, and brand visibility.



Understanding Spotify’s Ranking Factors



Spotify’s algorithm employs artist-sourced metadata, audio signal analysis, and NLP models to effectively categorize and distribute content, enhancing discoverability. The platform analyzes:




Artist-sourced metadata: Information from your Spotify for Creators profile and pitch forms



Raw audio signals: Numerical values assigned to track attributes like danceability, energy, and valence



Natural language processing: Analysis of lyrics, web-crawled data from music blogs, and user-generated playlist patterns




This backend data provides context that helps algorithms serve users more relevant content (similar to technical SEO and technical AEO helping crawlers understand your site).

Disclaimer: We do have far, far less data on how to get cited in LLMs from the perspective of Spotify SEO, so in this guide, I’ll be giving you some AEO tactics that have been proven to work across traditional search surfaces and their potential applications for Spotify optimization.



Spotify SEO & AEO: 4 Tactics



Battling with Spotify’s search algorithm, indexability in traditional search results in Google, and ChatGPT’s somewhat recent integration with Spotify, it might feel like you’re fighting an uphill battle with organic discovery.



That’s why I’m here 🙂These four tactics will help you maximize visibility across Spotify’s platform, Google search, AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and any other generative AI search engines that decide to cite Spotify directly (or indirectly) in their responses.



Tactic 1: Cross-Platform Keyword Optimization



The ultimate goal with effective keyword optimization is more than showing up in Spotify’s internal search (especially in this novel search ecosystem); your keywords should work across Spotify, Google Search, ChatGPT queries, and AI Overviews simultaneously.



Fair warning: This guide is going to get realllllll search nerd-y real fast. So if you’re looking for a quick way to game the system, you can click off of this page. You’re in the wrong place.



Understanding Multi-Platform Keyword Discovery



To know where you should be found, you should first figure out where you can be found. Research how audiences describe music across different search platforms. The language varies by context:




Google searches are specific and lack filler words (“best synthwave playlist 2026”)



ChatGPT queries are often conversational (“recommend some retro electronic music with vocals”)



Spotify searches tend to be brief (“workout beats”)




Your keyword strategy must account for all three patterns. Analyze search results directly within each platform. Understanding these nuances helps you choose keywords that perform across platforms, or zero in on a specific platform you want to improve your visibility on.



Strategic Keyword Placement for SEO & AEO



Once you’ve identified high-value keywords, deploy them strategically across your entire digital presence:

The Lyric Opportunity



While Spotify’s lyrics aren’t directly indexed by Google as standalone pages, they still impact discoverability:




Spotify’s natural language processing analyzes lyrics for locations, brands, and people mentioned in songs to create additional context.



When listeners remember a lyric fragment and search it on Google, the search engine pulls from lyrics sites like Genius and MusixMatch (not directly from Spotify, though Spotify does use MusixMatch).



ChatGPT, on the other hand, can identify songs based on lyric descriptions using its training data.




This means having your lyrics accurately transcribed and distributed across multiple lyric platforms (Genius, MusixMatch, AZLyrics, etc.) increases your chances of being discovered through both traditional search and AI assistants.



Monitor Cross-Platform Keyword Performance



Track which keywords drive engagement across different platforms.




Within Spotify, analyze which search terms lead to your profile views and follow through Spotify for Creators analytics.



Use Google Search Console to see which queries bring traffic to your Spotify links.



Test ChatGPT regularly by asking it to recommend music based on your target keywords and noting whether your content appears in responses.




Creatives Beware: Don’t hyperfocus on keyword targeting, though (especially not at the expense of your sound or your artistic freedom). TikTok and “coworker music” jokes aside, there are plenty of other ways to get discovered other than saying so directly in your music.



Tactic 2: Keyword-Rich Playlist Strategy for Multiple Discovery Channels



Playlists function as discovery tools across multiple platforms, not just within Spotify. An intentionally optimized playlist can rank in Spotify’s internal search, appear in Google Search results, get recommended by ChatGPT, and surface in AI Overviews, multiplying your visibility exponentially.



Building Playlists That Rank Everywhere



Your playlist title is the single most important element for cross-platform discovery. It needs to work for:




Spotify’s algorithm: Clear, keyword-focused titles that match user search behavior



Google Search: Descriptive titles that appear in search results when people look for playlists outside Spotify



ChatGPT recommendations: Titles that make sense when AI describes them conversationally to users



AI Overviews: Concise titles that AI can easily summarize and reference




For example, “Vocal Synthwave Retrowave” targets specific genre keywords that fans actively search across all platforms. Someone might search “synthwave playlist” on Google, ask ChatGPT for “retro electronic music with vocals,” or type “vocal synthwave” directly into Spotify. If they do so, this title would be perfect because it captures all three discovery paths.



Creatives Beware: This is another place where I’ll warn you about throttling your creativity for the sake of discovery. You shouldn’t make it a hard and fast rule to avoid clever or abstract playlist titles. My job might depend on my content being indexed, surfaced, and written, but yours also depends on the human emotion and feelings behind your art.



Optimizing Playlist Descriptions for SEO & AEO



Your playlist description should serve multiple audiences simultaneously: Spotify users browsing playlists, Google’s web crawlers, and AI models analyzing context. In my opinion, this is where you have the room to get a bit more technical with optimizations.



Structure descriptions with this multi-platform approach:




First sentence: If it fits, include your primary keyword and core value proposition. This appears in search snippets on Google and gets prioritized by AI summarization tools.



Middle content: Add secondary keywords naturally and describe the mood, intended use, or theme. If you can, include relevant entities (genre names, similar artists, cultural references) that strengthen AI understanding.



Final sentence: Optionally include a frequency note that you update when you add to the playlist; this signals freshness to algorithms.

This description works for Spotify users seeking context, includes searchable keywords for Google, and gives AI models clear categorization signals for accurate recommendations.



Strategic Track Selection for Algorithm Signals



Combining your content with established artists serves dual purposes:




Within Spotify, popular tracks boost playlist growth and introduce listeners to your work through the 30-second rule (streams count after 30 seconds, signaling to algorithms that your content resonates).



In Google, playlists containing well-known artists may rank higher in search results because they have more perceived authority. When someone searches “best synthwave playlists,” Google often prioritizes lists that include recognized names alongside emerging artists.



For ChatGPT and AI recommendations, having your tracks alongside established artists in well-described playlists helps AI models understand your musical positioning. ChatGPT can describe your sound in fan-friendly language and help you understand how your music fits into different playlist contexts.




The more your songs appear in genre-specific, keyword-optimized playlists with similar artists, the more accurately Spotify, traditional search, and AI tools can recommend your music.



Visual Optimization for Click-Through Rates



I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention your overall ✨vibe✨ at least once in this article. Just like the actual music you put out, or the playlists you make, your playlist cover art impacts performance across platforms.




On Spotify, eye-catching, theme-appropriate artwork improves click-through rates in search results (be sure to keep to platform dimension requirements of 3000x3000px)



On Google, when your playlist appears in image search or regular search results, compelling artwork makes your listing stand out.



Even in ChatGPT conversations, when users click through to recommended playlists, professional cover art builds credibility.




Tactic 3: Artist & Podcast Profile Optimization Across Search Ecosystems



When you zoom wayyyyyy out (like I did when I first stepped out of the line of traditional SEO), you’ll learn that your Spotify profile is part of a broader digital ecosystem that includes Google Search results, social media platforms, and AI knowledge bases.



Optimizing your profile means that you, too, need to think beyond Spotify’s platform to how your content appears across all discovery channels.



I’m going to split this section up into “for podcasters” and “for musical artists”; there’s no personal beef here, we’re all creatives. The strategies just look a little different is all.



For Podcasters: Multi-Platform Profile Strategy



Your show page optimization should account for how different systems discover and understand your podcast. Spotify’s internal algorithm, Google’s web crawlers, podcast directories, and AI models all parse your metadata differently.

Tactic 4: Entity Optimization for ChatGPT & AI Search



As AI search tools reshape music discovery, optimizing for entity recognition (how AI models understand and categorize your work) is becoming as important as traditional SEO. I won’t lie, it’s tedious, and it’s not an exact science, but it is worth it if discoverability is the goal.



ChatGPT’s Spotify integration, Google AI Overviews, and other generative engines are now primary discovery mechanisms for millions of listeners.



Step 1: Testing Your AI Visibility



Since ChatGPT now integrates with Spotify, you can ask it to recommend music based on specific criteria and see if your content appears. Regular testing reveals how AI systems perceive and categorize your work:



ChatGPT test prompts for musicians:




“Recommend emerging [your genre] artists similar to [established artist in your niche]”



“Find music with [specific attributes of your sound] on Spotify”



“What are the best [mood/vibe] playlists featuring [your genre]?”



“Create a playlist for [use case that fits your music] with indie artists”




ChatGPT test prompts for podcasters:




“Recommend podcasts about [your topic] similar to [popular show in your niche]”



“What are the best [your topic] podcasts for [your target audience]?”



“Find podcast episodes discussing [specific topic you’ve covered]”




Document your results monthly. If your content doesn’t appear in relevant responses, it signals optimization opportunities. Note which entities (genres, moods, similar artists, topics) ChatGPT associates with your work, then adjust your metadata to strengthen accurate associations while correcting mischaracterizations.



Step 2: Embedding Content Across Your Digital Ecosystem



AI crawlers gather context from how your content appears across the web, not just from Spotify’s database. The more places AI finds your music or podcast paired with relevant keywords and context, the stronger your entity associations become.

The more diverse sources mention your work with consistent language, the more confidently AI models can categorize and recommend you.



You’ve heard me use the word “consistent” enough that it’s probably lost all meaning. But I’ll stress this: clean, consistent data matters enormously. When AI models encounter conflicting information across sources (different genre labels, varying artist name spellings, inconsistent descriptions), they lose confidence in their categorization, which reduces the likelihood of recommendations.



Step 3: Strategic Playlist Features for Entity Building



Getting featured in playlists that contain keywords you’d like to rank for strengthens your association with those terms across search ecosystems. Each playlist placement builds your entity relationships within specific contexts.



Actively pursue playlists that:




Have keyword-rich titles matching your target search terms



Are created by influencers, music blogs, or media outlets (higher authority)



Match your content’s specific mood, use case, or characteristics



Are publicly shareable and appear in Google search results



Have active curation and regular updates (signals quality)



Contain similar artists in your niche (strengthens entity clustering)




Step 4: Leveraging Spotify’s Natural Language Processing



Spotify’s algorithm analyzes lyrics, web-crawled data from music blogs and digital media, and user-generated playlists to understand context. While you can’t directly control Spotify’s NLP, you can influence the signals it receives:




Ensure your lyrics are accurately uploaded and synced across platforms



Engage with music blogs and get your work written about using your target keywords



Participate in playlist communities where curators discuss their selections



Encourage fans to create and share playlists featuring your work with descriptive titles




This contextual information feeds into how algorithms categorize your content, which in turn affects how AI tools recommend your music to users.



The Compounding Effect



This seems like a lot of work (even my brain got tired from researching and writing this), but here’s the deal: entity optimization works cumulatively.



Each properly targeted keyword, each optimized profile, each playlist placement, each piece of press coverage, and each metadata field across platforms strengthens Spotify’s, Google’s, and AI’s understanding of your work.



Over time, this creates a compounding effect: the more clearly the algorithms that be understand you (who you are, what you create, where you fit in the musical landscape), the more confidently it recommends your content.



Ready to SEO-ify Your Spotify Presence?



Boosting your work’s visibility on Spotify requires meeting your audience where they are: in-platform optimization, in search engines, and in LLMs.



There’s just one more word of wisdom I’d like to leave you with, however: the key to this type of visibility strategy is consistency. It’s not a one-and-done process, and it’s not an easy one (if it is, nobody would need to do it).



Regularly update your metadata across all platforms, engage with your audience through social media, stay informed about algorithm changes and keyword performance, and adapt your strategy as search behavior continues to evolve (and when it does, you can find updates about it on NoGood’s blog 😉).



As LLMs deepen their Spotify integration, as Google continues refining its search algorithm and AI Overviews, and as Spotify’s algorithm evolves to prioritize new engagement metrics, staying current with optimization best practices across in-platform, traditional SEO, and AI discovery channels will keep you ahead of the curve and ensure your music or podcast continues reaching new listeners organically.

Threads: The Platform That Everyone’s Sleeping On



You may see Threads and think, “okay, cool, another platform no one’s going to use,” but don’t skip past it too fast. You can get a lot more out of it than you realize.



It’s proving to be a serious marketing platform with 141.5 million daily active users and tons of opportunities for brands. And while people are still on the fence about joining in (and still debating on whether it’s going to last), smart brands have been using Threads marketing to grow audiences, test strategies, and boost their engagement rates.



So, what’s the point of Threads for marketing, you ask? It’s taking advantage of the app being Meta’s latest creation, and an easier way for your brand to gain visibility. And before you say we’re all talk, we’ve got proof.



Why Did Threads Shut Down?



Before we get into it, we’ll answer a burning question that some readers may have: why Threads shut down. For those who weren’t aware, before Threads was the app we know today, it was a standalone Instagram messaging app developed by Meta and launched in 2019. It shut down just two years later in 2021 due to a lack of usage (womp womp).



The current Threads (launched in July of 2023), though, is thriving with millions of users. They may have the same parent company and name, but they’re totally different platforms.

Now, let’s get into the ways in which Threads is a goldmine for brands and marketers (and yes, this is my way of telling you that you should definitely be on Threads without saying it outright).



1. Threads’ Growth Is Insane



Within five days of its launch, Threads hit 100 million sign-ups, making it the fastest-growing app ever. As an FYI, TikTok took nine months to hit that. 



By Q4 2024, Threads had 275 million MAU (monthly active users), and by early 2025, they’d hit 320 million MAU. Don’t worry, I’ve done the math on that for you: that’s 127.8% year-over-year growth. Analysts also project it could generate $11.3 billion in revenue by 2026.



So, why should you care? Getting in early on growing platforms means better visibility and less competition. WebFX’s data shows that early adopters see 30-50% faster follower growth than late joiners. You’re basically giving yourself a head start before the competition even begins.

2. There’s Actual Engagement on Threads



While engagement declines on other platforms, Threads said, “nah, not me.” In November of 2025, the average engagement rate on Threads was 4.51%, with the median at 6.25% (for added context, that’s 73.6% higher than X’s 3.6%).



Buffer’s analysis also shows that the typical Threads post gets 4-5 engagements, and that number is climbing. Not only that, people actually reply with thoughtful comments instead of just liking and scrolling (or posting the classic three-emoji bot reply we all know and love).



Text-based posts also encourage real conversation. Research from inBeat Agency found that brands posting consistently and engaging in replies see 2-3x higher engagement than those just putting out. And posts that are authentic, unhinged, and Gen Z-focused are also normally what the platform favors.



Better engagement also drives stronger marketing ROI, and once Meta’s full ad ecosystem comes into play, brands with high organic engagement will pop off in paid advertising, too.

3. Instagram Integration = Instant Audience



Instead of starting from scratch on Bluesky or Mastodon, Threads lets you instantly notify your Instagram followers when you post. The advantage here is that rather than rebuilding your presence on a completely new platform, you’re instantly reaching an audience that’s already interested in what you’ve got to say.



The tight connection between Instagram and Threads also means that your Instagram profile photo, bio, and verification carry over automatically. You also get to manage Facebook, Instagram, and Threads from one dashboard with Meta Business Suite. Not only is social media activity more efficient, but social media analytics, too.



Not convinced yet? Here are some compelling statistics that might change your mind:




Social media marketing agencies report that clients with 100k+ Instagram followers typically see 20-30% of their audience also follow them on Threads within the first month (think about this like almost instantly getting 20,000-30,000 engaged followers with one notification).



Brands that push Threads via Instagram see follower acquisition costs drop 60-70% compared to promoting it on its own.

4. The Threads Algorithm Rewards Real Conversations



We’re all tired of the over-polished yapping, and Threads is recognizing that by favoring authentic conversation. Simple text posts that push for replies consistently outperform any scripted marketing.



WebFX’s research shows that brands with relatable voices attract followers 40% faster than corporate-speak accounts. Posh LinkedIn language won’t work here. It’s the quick thoughts, timely reactions, and raw observations that’ll help brands win on this app. 



Not to mention, Gen Z (Threads’ largest user segment) can sniff out fake authenticity from a mile away. Marin Software’s analysis confirms Gen Z users on Threads want genuine connections, therefore, the algorithm rewards meaningful dialogue over passive scrolling.



For influencer marketing, micro-influencers with loyal followers who are highly engaged normally crush celebrity accounts because their content feels real. 



Brands are all trying to crack the code when it comes to social media algorithms, and Threads is simply asking for brands to be real with their audience. It’s that easy.

5. Threads Marketing Actively Puts You on New Screens



The Threads algorithm not only rewards original posts, but also actively surfaces your content to people who don’t follow you (unlike X, which relies on followers and retweets). This is huge for brands who value audience growth beyond their existing base.



Topic tags, which are a (better) version of hashtags, can also make content discoverable to interested users. Social Media Today reports that Threads’ AI-powered recommendations actively learn what users engage with and surface similar content from new accounts.



What does this mean? Your best content has viral potential regardless of follower count, so long as people are actively searching for that topic.



Much like TikTok, users see a “For You” feed combining posts from accounts they already follow mixed in with algorithmic recommendations. Early engagement with your content can trigger exponential reach, as the algorithm pushes high-performing content further. This is better for growth in comparison to Instagram and X, considering the oversaturation of content.



Marketing managers running social listening campaigns can identify and jump on trending conversations faster on Threads than on X because there’s less noise. A brand with 5,000 followers can realistically reach 500,000+ users with the right content, which is increasingly becoming rare on more mature platforms.

6. Ad Fatigue Hasn’t Hit Threads Just Yet



Throwback to when Facebook ads were cheap and effective. For those who thought we’d never see that again… you’re wrong! That window exists right now on Threads, but it’s closing fast.



As of February 2026, Meta rolled out Threads ads to all users worldwide, but the ad ecosystem is still fairly small and contained. Threads isn’t drowning in promos yet, which means this is the perfect time for brands to swoop in.



Our recommendation? Focus on building organic reach now while it’s strong, then use it to boost paid campaigns later. We’re not getting this out of nowhere; it’s the same playbook that worked for early Instagram and TikTok adopters.



Estimates suggest that Threads’ CPM will settle around $5-10, putting it in price competition with Instagram and Facebook, but with far less competition for attention. Thread’s revenue was at $200-250 million in 2024, exploding to $8 billion by 2025 as Meta integrated Threads into its advertising ecosystem.



Getting in on Threads advertising now requires understanding organic content before paying for reach, and that’s a game-changer (and an ad spend-saver).



7. Monetizing on Threads: How Marketers & Creators Are Already Earning



Looking past the more traditional social media marketing tactics, Threads isn’t just an app for sharing thoughts; it’s also turning into a platform where creators and marketers win, too. Whether it’s influencer deals, paid ads, affiliate marketing, B2B content, or creative projects, marketers and creators are already driving earnings. How, you ask?




Brand Collaborations: Brands are paying for influencer collaborations because, as I mentioned previously, engagement rates are 2-3x higher than Instagram. In fact, Research Key’s analysis shows that micro influencers with 10,000-50,000 engaged followers command $500-2,000 per sponsored post. Quality engagement matters more than follower count.



Paid Ads: With ads now running globally, brands can advertise directly through Meta Business Suite. Early advertisers report strong performance for awareness campaigns targeting Gen Z and Millennials.



Affiliate Marketing: Content creators are driving traffic to affiliate links and product pages. The 500-character format makes it easy to tell concise product stories that push for action without feeling like people are being sold to.



B2B Services: B2B content performs surprisingly well, with B2B brands seeing 40-50% better engagement on Threads than LinkedIn (Threads’ conversational format feels less corporate).




All Blog Things’ guide also says successful monetizers focus on building genuine engagement through Q&A threads, establishing niche expertise, providing value before pitching, and using Two-Factor authentication to build trust.



After Threads launched in 2023, Mark Zuckerberg mentioned waiting until the platform had “hundreds of millions” of users before rolling out comprehensive creator monetization. As of early 2026, Threads has surpassed 400 million MAU, officially crossing that threshold 👀



I’ll say this now (so you can thank me later): brands should expect Instagram-style creator bonuses, tipping, and subscriptions within the year.



It’s Time To Get Your Thread In The Game



You can sit around and wait all you want, but while you’re debating whether Threads is “worth it,” your competitors are building communities, learning the algorithm, and claiming their space (which could be your space).



The numbers don’t lie. With 400+ million monthly active users, ~140 million daily active users, Threads’ engagement rates are destroying those of mature platforms, and revenue projections are hitting over $11 billion. Threads is Meta’s next major platform, and there’s no doubt about it.

If you need someone to compare yourself to, major brands like The American Red Cross, Mayo Clinic, and University of Cambridge are already there. If even these conservative marketers are putting money into Threads (and you still need more of a sign to follow suit), you should be too.



Social media managers should be actively thinking about this opportunity. Because from an operational efficiency perspective, is it not much better to be investing 30 minutes a day building organic reach to people that actually see it, instead of pouring money and hard work into Instagram ads that don’t deliver?



The opportunity for growth on Threads is wide open, but rest assured, it won’t stay that way.



The platform has already achieved the “hundreds of millions” of users target, and it’ll only get bigger from here. And when ad costs climb, you’ll wish you’d started today. The brands winning on Threads in 2026 will be the ones who started before the flood.



In conclusion, why Threads? Your audience is already there, and the engagement rates are strong. With the algorithm rewarding authenticity and the ad ecosystem in its best shape, it’s time to claim space before your competitors beat you to it.

Everybody talks about burgers, tacos, and fried chicken, but Arby’s has solid sandwiches you don’t really get anywhere else: roast beef, turkey, even corned beef when they run the Reuben. The meat is hot, the sandwiches are big—none of these skimpy dollar menu things.

Their curly fries are some of the best fries you can get, and if you’re real hungry, their “2 for $7” or whatever deal they’re running is a good value—get two decent-size sandwiches for about 8 bucks. I can eat in the truck easy, won’t be hungry again in two hours.

Plus, Arby’s is usually fast through the drive-thru and not as packed as some other places around lunch. Consistent, too. Doesn’t get the hype, but it’s a reliable stop when you want something different than just another burger."

You get something a little different than the usual burger or chicken, and the portions fill you up without being skimpy.

Their roast beef sandwiches are hard to mess up, there’s more meat on ‘em than most burger joints, and you can change it up with a French Dip or their turkey sandwiches. The curly fries are easily in my top three for fast food sides."
